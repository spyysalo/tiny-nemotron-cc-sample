Erik Davis looks at modern information technology--and much previous technology--to reveal how much of it has roots in spiritual attitudes. Furthermore, he explores how those who embrace each new technological advance often do so with designs and expectations stemming from religious sensibilities. In doing so, Davis both compares and contrasts the scientific attitude that we can know reality technologically and the Gnostic idea of developing ultimate understanding. Although organized into reasonable chapters, there's a strong stream-of-consciousness component to Davis's writing. His expositions may run, for example, from information theory to the nebulous nature of Gnosticism to the philosophical problem of evil-­all in just a few pages. It's as if there are so many connections to make that Davis's prose has to run back and forth across time and space drawing the lines. But the result, rather than being chaotic, is a lively interplay of wide-ranging ideas. His style is equally lively and generally engaging--if sometimes straying into the hip. In the end, he succeeds in showing the spiritual side of what some may see as cold, technological thought. --Elizabeth Lewis[via]\nMore editions of TechGnosis : Myth, Magic, and Mysticism in the Information Age:\nAward-winning author and radio personality Ellen Kushners\n\nQuestion: What is the main argument of the book \"TechGnosis\"?

Presented below are the stages of production starting from the carving and going on through to the finishing of one of these fine inkstones.\nStage 1\nForming an Edg: An edge is formed around the stone by placing the end of a chisel handle against the shoulder and using the weight of the body to carve the stone. To do this successfully is not merely a matter of strength because forming the gently curving edge also requires skill and technique.\nStage 2\nRough Carving: The flat bed on which the ink stick is rubbed and the depression where the ink collects are now roughly carved with confident strokes of the chisel down to more or less the right depth.\nClick on the picture for QuickTime Movie\nStage 3\nCarving the Depression: The depression where the ink collects takes up one-third of the whole stone; and at its deepest point, it is two-thirds of the thickness of the stone. The mason constantly uses his hand to check the size and depth of this depression as he is carving. No measure of any kind is used. Everything is done by touch. The gentle slope from the flat bed into the depression simply aids the flow of ink into the depression.\nStage 4\nSanding: A whetstone and wet paper are used to rub down first the inside, outside and then all of the surfaces to finish them. One of the most important parts of the stone is, of course, the flat bed on which an ink stick is rubbed. This is handled most carefully, and the surface is constantly checked with the hand as it is rubbed down.\nClick on the picture for QuickTime Movie\nStage 5\nFinishing the Bottom: The bottom of the stone is now made flat. If the bottom is not finished properly, the quality of the work carried out on the depression and flat rubbing bed will be to no avail. A flat base to the stone is essential, so that when it is used, the force of rubbing the ink stick is evenly distributed over the whole area of the bottom. It takes just as much effort, in fact, to smooth off the bottom as it does to carve the stone, and the craftsman must concentrate the whole weight of his body behind his hand as he levels off the bottom of the ink stone.\nStage 6\nFinishing: There are three ways in which the stones are finished, either with natural lacquer, a form of heat treatment or by giving them a coat of ink. Each finish has is own distinctive luster.\n\nQuestion: What is the final stage in the production of Ogatsu Inkstones? Answer: The final stage is finishing, which can be done with natural lacquer, heat treatment, or a coat of ink.\n\nQuestion: Who are the specialists involved in making Ogatsu Inkstones?

{"text": "Carbon Dating\nStar this video\nExplanation\nCarbon dating uses an unstable isotope of carbon to find the date of dead substances. This isotope Carbon-14 has a half life of 5,700 years. The ratio of Carbon-14 remaining indicates the times since the death of a living substance. Carbon-14 only works for things between 3 and 40 thousand years old.\nTranscript\nSo let's talk about carbon dating. Carbon dating is based on an isotope of carbon, carbon 14, that's unstable. It decays with a half life of 5700 years into nitrogen 14 and electron and an electron antineutreno. So this is just an ordinary beta decay process and this carbon fourteen's half life is way way way too short for any carbon to just kind of exist naturally in the atmosphere, you'd think, not quite right.\nThe natural abundance is 1.3 times 10 to the -12. So that mean that 1.3 times 10 to the -12 carbon 14 atoms, exist for each and every carbon 12 atom in nature. Now carbon 12 of course is stable. So you'd think that if you got this 1.3 times 10 to the -12 carbon 14 atoms for each carbon 12 atom at some time, well then 5700 years later, half of the carbon 14 will have decayed. So now we should have less. But in fact what happens is, cosmic rays from the sun interact with the upper atmosphere and they actually create carbon 14, at this rate so that in equilibrium, 1.3 times 10 to the -12 carbon 14 atoms will exist for every carbon 12 atom. So that's taking into account all the decays and all that stuff, this is a natural abundance.\nNow, I'm alive. You're alive. What do we do? We breathe. We breathe in carbon dioxide, we eat carbon, we take in carbon and so our bodies continually renewing our supply of carbon 14. So for that reason, every living thing that is interacting with its environment is expected to have this natural abundance of carbon 14. 1.3 times 10 to the -12. But when something dies, now it's not interacting with the environment anymore. It's no longer replenishing its carbon 14 supply. And that means that as time goes on, the carbon 14 abundance will decrease. So that means the carbon 14 abundance can tell us how long something's been dead. Alright. So let's see how we can use this to do a problem.\n\nQuestion: What is the natural abundance of Carbon-14 compared to Carbon-12? Answer: 1.3 times 10 to the -12\n\nQuestion: What is the process by which Carbon-14 decays? Answer: It decays into Nitrogen-14, an electron, and an electron antineutrino through beta decay.", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "4d71810d-4f14-4866-a657-668d018f5ef1", "url": "http://brightstorm.com/science/physics/nuclear-physics/carbon-dating/"}

(Jon Austria/ The Daily Times)\nFARMINGTON — Establishing an independent business is the dream of many individuals, but the challenge of getting started can cause would-be entrepreneurs to delay -- or completely abandon -- pursuing their dream.\nThe Four Corners Startup Weekend, held November 15 through 17 and hosted by the San Juan College Enterprise Center, is designed to teach the basics of founding startups and launching successful ventures, according to a San Juan College press release.\nThe basic idea is to bring potential entrepreneurs alongside business development individuals for a weekend-long experiential workshop to pitch ideas, form teams, and start companies. It is designed to allow budding entrepreneurs to test startup ideas, meet potential co-founders, and launch a business.\nThe event is open to anyone in the Four Corners including students, entrepreneurs, potential entrepreneurs, and anyone who merely has a good idea they would like to develop.\nStartup Weekend is a non-profit group based in Seattle, Wash., that organizes 54-hour events in cities around the world, all of which help educate, support and empower people to become entrepreneurs. While this will be the county's first Startup Weekend, the event is actually the result of a global grassroots movement, and the group says more than 1,000 events worldwide have resulted in more than 8,000 new startup businesses.\nJudy Castleberry, San Juan College Enterprise Center director, said she and other organizers are hoping the event will help build a stronger base of locally-grown businesses within the Four Corners.\n\"We were looking for ways to educate and support people interested in developing a business concept, product or service,\" explains Castleberry. \"We are excited about Startup Weekend because of the successes it has had in other areas.\"\nCastleberry said this won't be the typical \"boring\" business conference, but instead will be about becoming part of a team and pitching ideas. She says the weekend will be packed with energy and excitement.\n\"I think people will have fun and become very engaged,\" she said. \"There's a real intensity about it, because people will truly be trying to see if they can pull together a business in a weekend. It will be a great networking event, and people can present their ideas and see if they're viable.\"\nCastleberry said participants do not need to come with a developed business plan; rather, the event is for people at the concept or idea phase of business development. She said there will be prizes for participants, who will present their ideas to a panel of judges.\n\"One prize is a free period of time to use the Enterprise Center,\" she said.\nCastleberry is encouraging anyone interested to register now.\n\nQuestion: Who is the director of the San Juan College Enterprise Center? Answer: Judy Castleberry\n\nQuestion: What is the duration of the event? Answer: 54 hours\n\nQuestion: Where is the event being hosted?

Q:What is brute-force attack?\nA: This Attack will try all possible character combinations.\n5. Q:What is brute-force with mask attack?\nA: It is important when you remember part of password that you could specify the kinds of character combinations and also the length selection of the password.\n6. Q:What's Character Set\"?\nA: It is only open to \"Brute-force with Mask Attack\" which instructs this program what characters happen to be used in the password and restrict the search area.\na-z, 0-9,A-Z, -_?!@#$... : Based on the Predefined Passwords Ranges. If the password contains these, check it.\nCustom Character Set : You are able to define your own Character Looking for the Brute-Force Attack. Check \"Custom Character Set\" and go into the Character with your own.\nPrefix : Should you recall the beginning of the password characters check it and go into the Character.\nSuffix : Should you recall the end from the password characters check it and go into the Character.\n7. Q:What is \"Dictionary Attack\"?\nA: It is an effective attack for you to recover lost password with a default dictionary in the program. The program will try every password in the dictionary. Besides, you can add your personal dictionary towards the program to save the recovery time. The dictionary is simply a text file with a word at a line; lines are separated with line breaks.\n8. Q:What's \"Smart Mutations\"?\nA: Smart Mutations enables you to try combinations among passwords in the dictionary. If you would like more character combinations, check \"Smart Mutations\" and select several for \"Mutation Count\". For instance, if you select the dictionary file contains three words(ab,cd,12), then you choose 2 for \"Mutation Count\" in order to allow the program mutate with one of these three sets, like ab,cd,12,abab,abcd,ab12,cdab,cdcd,cd12,12ab,12cd,1212 ,etc. Select a number in the \"Max Password Length\" for that possible maximum period of your password.\n9. Q:What's the \"Program Priority\"?\nA:Changing Program Priority enables you to control the allocation of processing resources on your computer. By default, all processes are at normal priority.\nIdle priority means that PDF Password Recovery will not interrupt other programs, so attacks won't decrease the performance of other running applications.\n\nQuestion: What is the minimum RAM requirement for running PDF Password Recovery?

First, the boat was rebuilt in a more Western style, which was considered offensive during a time when Western influence was threatening the collapse of the Qing Dynasty and causing unwelcome shifts in traditional Chinese culture.

Markets provide incentives to sell goods and productive resources where they\nwill bring the highest prices and to buy them where they can be obtained at the lowest prices.\nProfits motivate business managers to improve production methods and to design goods that\nmatch consumer needs. Workers who stay alert to opportunities and work where they are most\nproductive receive the highest wages. Consumers are motivated to use less expensive substitutes\nwhere feasible.\nAdam Smith, often considered the father of economics, saw the achievement of coordination\nthrough markets as the foundation of prosperity and progress. In a famous passage in The Wealth\nof Nations, he called markets an \"invisible hand\" that nudges people into the economic roles they\ncan play best (see Who Said It? Who Did It? 1.2). To this day, an appreciation of markets as a\nmeans of coordinating choices remains a central feature of the economic way of thinking.\nWho Said It? Who Did It? 1.2\nADAM SMITH ON THE INVISIBLE HAND\nAdam Smith is considered to have been the founder of economics as a distinct field of study,\neven though he wrote only one book on the subject: The Wealth of Nations, published in 1776.\nSmith was 53 years old at the time. His friend David Hume found the book such hard going that\nDolan and Lindsey, Macroeconomics, chapter 1 • 14\nhe doubted that many people would read it. But Hume was wrong—people have been reading it\nfor more than 200 years.\nThe wealth of a nation, in Smith's view, was not a result of the accumulation of gold or silver\nin its treasury, as many contemporary theorists believed. Rather, it was the outcome of the\nactivities of ordinary people working and trading in free markets. To Smith, the remarkable thing\nabout the wealth produced by a market economy is that it is not a result of any organized plan,\nbut rather the unintended outcome of the actions of many people, each of whom is pursuing the\nincentives the market offers with his or her own interests in mind. As he put it:\nIt is not from the benevolence of the butcher, the brewer, or the baker that we expect our\ndinner, but from their regard to their own interest. . . . Every individual is continually exerting\nhimself to find out the most advantageous employment for whatever capital he can command. . .\n. By directing that industry in such a manner as its produce may be of the greatest value, he\nintends only his own gain, and he is in this, as in many other cases, led by an invisible hand to\npromote an end which was no part of his intention.*\nMuch of the discipline of economics as it has developed over the past two centuries consists\nof elaborations on ideas found in Smith's work. The idea of the \"invisible hand\" of market\nincentives that channels people's efforts in directions that are beneficial to their neighbors\nremains the most durable of Smith's contributions to economics.\n\nQuestion: Which of the following is NOT a contribution of Adam Smith to economics? A) The idea of supply and demand B) The concept of \"trickle-down economics\" C) The \"invisible hand\" metaphor Answer: B) The concept of \"trickle-down economics\"\n\nQuestion: According to Smith, why do people engage in economic activities?

The series covers the history of African Americans from the time the first Blacks arrived through the historic election of President Obama.\nA short snippet of the series was shown at the Oct. 9 launch party, which also featured a buffet reception. The documentary clip was followed by a panel discussion between Gates and civil rights icons Rep. John Lewis (D-Ga.), NAACP President Emeritus Julian Bond and award-winning journalist and author Charlayne Hunter-Gault, the first Black woman to attend the University of Georgia. The event also had a Q & A session with the panel members.\nGates told the audience that the series was the result of many hours of copious research, including interviews with many people who have studied or lived through pivotal events in Black American history. Forty historians contributed, he said. Of the many hundred subjects and events suggested by the historians, 70 stories are told.\nDuring the panel discussions, each of the civil rights leaders recounted their individual experiences, including Lewis, who talked about the infamous attack by police on activists on what came to be known as Bloody Sunday, March 7, 1965, on the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, Ala.\n\"I left some blood on that bridge,\" Lewis told the audience. He also discussed with Gates his role in in the historic March on Washington 50 years ago.\nThe panelists lamented the lack of inclusion of African American history in lessons taught to children in school. Bond said he takes people on junkets throughout the South to expose them to people and places where Black history took place.\nThe series is the latest of several collaborations between Gates and public television, including Finding Your Roots in 2012, African American Lives in 2006 and African American Lives 2 in 2008 and Wonders of the African World in 1999.\n\nQuestion: What is the total duration of the six-part series?

Three decades later, it is the richest and most influential country in Europe, and Margaret Thatcher is the reason. The preternaturally determined Thatcher rose from nothing, seized control of Britain's Conservative party, and took a sledgehammer to the nation's postwar socialist consensus. She proved that socialism could be reversed, inspiring a global free-market revolution. Simultaneously exploiting every politically useful aspect of her femininity and defying every conventional expectation of women in power, Thatcher crushed her enemies with a calculated ruthlessness that stunned the British public and without doubt caused immense collateral damage.\nUltimately, however, Claire Berlinski agrees with Thatcher: There was no alternative.

{"text": "Conspiracy exists when two or more persons come to an agreement concerning the commission of a felony and decide to commit it. Conspiracy can also be proven based on the idea of \"unity of purpose\" and acts leading to a common design. There is proposal when the person who has decided to commit a felony proposes its execution to some other person or persons. Conspiracy and proposal to commit a felony are generally not punishable, except for conspiracy and proposal to commit treason, coup d'etat, and rebellion. Whilst not generally punishable, conspiracy can determine the degree of participation in criminal offenses in order to determine criminal liability.\nThe presence of certain circumstances have the effect of removing, mitigating or aggravating criminal liability of persons. Persons who commit crimes when justifying circumstances are present do not incur criminal or civil liability. Acting in self-defense is one of these justifying circumstances.\nThe presence of exempting circumstances on the other hand will exempt the perpetrator from criminal liability but not from civil liability. Some of these exempting circumstances are imbecility or youth. On the other hand, the presence of one or more mitigating circumstances when a crime is committed, can serve to reduce the penalty imposed. An example is voluntary surrender.\nLastly, the presence of aggravating circumstances will increase the penalty imposed under the crime, upon conviction. Some examples are contempt or insult to public authority.\nUnder the Revised Penal Code, when more than one person participated in the commission of the crime, the law looks into their participation because in punishing offenders, the Revised Penal Code classifies them as principals, accomplices, or accessories. A persons can be liable as a principal for (a) taking a direct part in the execution of the felony, (b) directly forcing or inducing others to commit it, or (c) cooperate in the commission of the offense by another act without which it would not have been accomplished. Accomplices are persons who, while not acting as a principal, cooperate in the execution of the offense by previous or simultaneous acts.\nLastly, accessories are those who, having knowledge of the commission of the crime, and without having participated therein, either as principals or accomplices, take part subsequent to its commission by: (a) profiting themselves or assisting the offender to profit by the effects of the crime, (b) concealing or destroying the body of the crime, or the effects or instruments thereof, in order to prevent its discovery, or (c) harboring, concealing, or assisting in the escape of the principals of the crime.\nPrincipals are punished more severely than accomplices, who are punished more severely than accessories. However, when there is conspiracy, there will no longer be a distinction as to whether a person acted as a principal, accomplice or accessory, because when there is conspiracy, the criminal liability of all will be the same, because the act of one is the act of all.\n\nQuestion: Which type of circumstance exempts the perpetrator from criminal liability but not from civil liability? Answer: Exempting circumstances\n\nQuestion: What is one of the justifying circumstances that can remove criminal liability?

As a young man, he became a backwoods Methodist minister, and then worked for a Quaker-run abolitionist paper. Volunteering for service in the Union Army, he was soon given a medical discharge, and spent the remaining war years as editor of the Winchester Journal in Randolph County, Indiana.[2] During this time he began corresponding with Charles Eliot Norton, the secretary of the Loyal Publication Society, beginning a lifelong friendship. In Norton's papers we see Harrison described as a figure much like Abraham Lincoln: an unaffected frontiersman, at once virtuous and wise.[2]\nAt the encouragement of Norton and his friends, Harrison began writing on some of the most important social issues of the day. These included the conditions in the South after the end of Reconstruction; working class culture and political life in New England; the condition of the American Indians; and the deforestation of the Northeast. During the 1882 campaign to preserve the natural environment around Niagara Falls, Harrison wrote a series of letters to newspapers in Boston and New York that turned public opinion in favor of preservation.[5] By 1889 he was a well-known figure among New England journalists and intellectuals; in that year he was awarded an honorary degree (Artium Magister) by Harvard University.[6]\nHarrison was recognized by his friends as someone with a unique and perceptive view of American life.[7] His work has an ethnographic feel, particularly his documentation of life in the post-bellum South, based on extensive travels and contact with ordinary people in the everyday business of life.[8] One of his major concerns was to show the highly educated cultural elite how the rest of America lived, thought, and felt. Like Charles Eliot Norton, he was a conservative in the stamp of Matthew Arnold, worried that capitalism insidiously worked to degrade culture, and part of his intentions—particularly in documenting the life of the New England working class—was to make the cultured elite more aware and more concerned about the spiritual life of ordinary people.[7] His work remains today as an important testimony of the conditions of life in the United States of the late nineteenth century.[9]\nThe Condition of Niagara Falls, and the Measures Needed to Preserve Them: Eight Letters Published in the New York Evening Post, the New York Tribune, and the Boston Daily Advertiser, during the Summer of 1882.(pamphlet) New York: Cambridge, J.

{"text": "The Catastrophic models are two and three-dimensional models that were introduced to the field of sport psychology by Hardy and Fazey in 1987 as a result of concerns over the validity of the predictions of the Inverted U Hypothesis. In contrast to the Inverted U Theory, the Catastrophic Model hypothesizes that once a certain level of arousal occurs beyond the optimum level, performance will dramatically decrease and the task will eventually be abandoned. Performers perceive an imbalance between task demands and their capability to match them, and as a result anxiety occurs. After such failure, performance level increases if stress levels are reduced to the point where the original performance curve was the highest. (Jones, 1989) This model proposes that when cognitive anxiety is low, physiological arousal has relatively small effects and possibly symmetrical effects upon performance. When cognitive anxiety reaches a higher level, the physiological effect of arousal is both large and catastrophic if the athlete does not know how to control it. With uncontrollable arousal, the athlete will surpass an optimal level of performance and perform poorly due to over correcting their actions, exerting too much energy or force, and misjudging the actions of their opponents. Their actions and ability to perform become dramatically disrupted. (Jones, 1989)\nThe Catastrophic three-dimensional model incorporates somatic anxiety and two aspects of cognitive anxiety - as its initial states as in pre-game and external expectations, and as its ability to mediate the effects of physiological arousal. (Graham, 1995) This model predicts that there will be an inverted-u relationship between physiological arousal and performance when cognitive anxiety is low. Also, if cognitive anxiety is high and the level of physiological arousal is increasing, then performance will also increase to a critical threshold, after which further increases in physiological arousal result in a catastrophic drop of the performance curve. Therefore, when physiological arousal is high, a negative correlation is more likely between cognitive anxiety and performance. If the physiological level is high the athlete's body is prepared to perform, they are ready for the competition and their adrenalin is pumping. When high arousal is occurring and their anxiety level also rises, the result can be over reaction to moves of the competitor, missed adjustment to their own actions, and frustration. The resulting frustrations lead to the breaking of the critical threshold and the catastrophic drop in performance level. (Graham, 1995) To avoid a catastrophic drop in performance, the athlete must know how to channel their anxieties so that they serve as beneficial influences in their actions.\nDespite the difference of these theories, they all have strengths and weaknesses. Overall, these theories demonstrate the need for mental preparation and skill to optimize athletic performance. The Inverted U Theory, Cue Utilization Theory, Drive Theory, Multi-Dimensional Theory, and the Catastrophic Model show that the most beneficial thing a coach could do for his or her athletes is take the time to include mental training and management techniques into everyday practice. Through including mental training techniques such as behavior modification, goal setting, and relaxation techniques into everyday practice, athletes and coaches will be more confident in performance, control anxiety and focus on strong performance.\n\nQuestion: What is the relationship between physiological arousal and performance when cognitive anxiety is low, according to the Catastrophic Model? Answer: An inverted-u relationship\n\nQuestion: Who introduced the Catastrophic models to sport psychology?

{"text": "What is the Difference Between Election and Predestination?\nI had someone ask me this question recently. My short answer is: in popular usage, not a lot.\nThe terms election and predestination are often used interchangeably, both referring to God's gracious decree whereby he chooses some for eternal life. In Romans 8:30 Paul speaks of those whom God has predestined, called, justified, and (in the end) glorified. In 8:33 Paul references \"the elect,\" apparently a synonym for the predestined ones described a few verses earlier.\nA sharp distinction between the two words is not warranted from Scripture, but if there is a distinction to be made, predestination is the general term for God's sovereign ordaining, while election is the specific term for God choosing us in Christ before the foundation of the world. That is, predestination is the broader category of which election is the smaller subset. Calvin defined predestination as \"God's eternal decree, by which he compacted with himself what he willed to become of each man…Therefore, as any man has been created to one or the other of these ends, we speak of him as predestined to life or to death\" (Inst. III.xxi.5). For Calvin, predestination encompasses the entire eternal decree. Election and reprobation, then, represent two different aspects of the decree. The Canons of Dort Article 1 makes the same distinctions.\nThis delineation is not without merit. The \"elect\" is always a positive designation in Scripture (e.g., Matt. 24:31; Titus 1:1), suggesting that election implies eternal life (though Rom 9:11 may be an exception to this rule). Predestination, on the other hand, can be used more broadly. Herod and Pontius Pilate, along with the Gentiles and people of Israel, did to Jesus what God's \"plan had predestined to take place\" (Acts 4:27-28). Indeed, all of our days are written in God's book before one of them comes to pass (Psalm 139:16 ). Every form of prosperity and affliction comes to us not by chance, but from God's fatherly hand (Heidelberg Catechism Q/A 27). Or as Augustine put it, \"The will of God is the necessity of all things.\"\nDoes this mean we are \"predestined\" to marry so-and-so or take a certain job? In one sense, looking back at God's providential care, we can say \"Yes, that's was God's plan for my life.\" And yet this notion of divine superintendence is not meant to undercut personal initiative and responsibility. Everything happens after the counsel of God's will (Eph. 1:11), but this is no excuse to neglect the use of means, nor is it a reason to think every decision we make is automatically pleasing to God. God's sovereign unalterable will of decree is not be confused with his violable will of desire.\n\nQuestion: According to the text, what does Augustine say about the will of God? Answer: Augustine says, \"The will of God is the necessity of all things.\"\n\nQuestion: Is it accurate to say that we are predestined to marry a certain person or take a specific job, according to the text? Answer: In one sense, looking back at God's providential care, we can say \"Yes,\" but this notion is not meant to undercut personal initiative and responsibility.\n\nQuestion: What does the text say about using means and making decisions that are pleasing to God? Answer: The text suggests that God's sovereign will does not excuse neglecting the use of means, nor does it mean every decision made is automatically pleasing to God.\n\nQuestion: According to the text, what does Paul say about the elect in Romans 8:33? Answer: Paul references \"the elect\" in Romans 8:33, apparently a synonym for the predestined ones described a few verses earlier.", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "3a7d4c2b-2cdf-4c53-83b5-bdc0bb070a68", "url": "http://thegospelcoalition.org/mobile/article/kevindeyoung/what-is-the-difference-between-election-and-predestination"}

This is one of the most efficient brake system currently employed in most vehicles. The main components of hydraulic master cylinder are: Casing. Plunger. Spring. Valve stem. Piston. Working of hydraulic brake master cylinder: As you can see in the fig: the casing of the master cylinder have two ports. One connected to the reservoir and other towards brake piston. The brake pedal is connected to the masted cylinder through some external links and the movement of the pedal will be reflected on the plunger. The plunger is linked with he spring and the valve stem. One end of the valve stem is locked to the plunger and the other end to the spring. Stage 1 (brake is applied): As the operator/ driver applied the brake the brake pedal moves to wards the master cylinder and the plunger moves through the bore of the master cylinder to its rear by pushing the valve stem and the spring. The rear end of the valve string is connected to the valve stem which acts as a piston. So as we move the brake pedal, it closes the reservoir port which is located to the end of the brake master cylinder. As the plunger further moves the pressured fluid move to the brake piston housing resulting in the movement of the brake piston there by the brake is applied. Stage 2 (brake pedal released): When the brake pedal is released, the plunger moves back there by reducing the pressure applied to the brake piston, resulting on the brake release.\n\nQuestion: Which of the following is NOT a component of the hydraulic master cylinder?

{"text": "Microorganisms such as fungi and bacteria also often take up residence in the soil and, when the earth is disturbed, get carried on the wind. Valley fever, an infection caused by a soil-borne fungus, is particularly common in the southwestern United States, especially during late summer, when soils are driest.\nIn his presentation at the American Geophysical Union conference, Stefanov will present data on the sources and sinks for dust in the Nogales, Arizona area, where he conducted the first tests of the use of remote sensing to map dust transport. Stefanov plans to apply the same techniques to mapping dust sources in the Phoenix area. Stefanov started mapping in Nogales because the region is growing quickly and, because construction generates lots of dust, he anticipated that dust transport could be a problem there. The Landsat 7 maps showed that construction sites are actually fairly minor contributors to dust in the region's air, whereas industrial sites are the most productive dust sources. Thickets of mesquite trees are settling-out areas for the dust.\nIn the rapidly expanding Phoenix area, growth is most rapid at the urban fringe, where agricultural fields are being replaced with residential and industrial developments. These are likely to be prime areas for the release of pesticides on airborne dust. Most of the dust traveling through the city of Phoenix comes from the surrounding mountain ranges. During summer, air currents coming from the Gulf of Mexico blow in from the south, passing Tucson en route. During winter, winds originate over the Pacific Ocean, traveling over the Sierra and Cascade Mountain ranges before reaching Phoenix. The particles carried on these winds are believed to be the source of most of the region's soil.\n\"Dust has been known as a health hazard for at least 20 years,\" says Stefanov. \"In the Valley, there's certainly a potential health risk.\" Because the damaging health effects of breathing dust depend on the amount of exposure, those most at risk are people living or working near a major dust source. \"If you drive through a dust cloud and breathe some dust, it's probably not going to hurt you,\" Stefanov says. \"But if you live down-range of an industrial site or some area where dust is always being generated and you're always breathing this stuff, then you might have something to worry about.\"\nRecently, public concern about dust-borne pathogens grew when marine biologists blamed the rapid demise of Caribbean corals on attacks by a fungus carried in Saharan dust. Droughts in Africa are causing larger, more frequent dust storms, some of which produce clouds of fine dust covering thousands of square miles. Trans-Atlantic winds can carry the dust to North America and the Caribbean. And, according to another recent study, the sandy particles kicked up in the dust storms may actually further reduce rainfall, exacerbating the drought conditions that caused the storms and fueling a vicious cycle.\nCorals may not be the only victims of exposure to toxic dust. Last fall, samples of dust carried from the Sahara to the U.S. Virgin Islands were shown to harbor heavy metals, bacteria, fungi, and what appeared to be viruses. Some researchers suspect that pathogens in the dust clouds are responsible for the high rates of asthma in the United States and the Caribbean.\n\nQuestion: What types of microorganisms have been found in dust samples carried from the Sahara to the U.S. Virgin Islands? Answer: Heavy metals, bacteria, fungi, and suspected viruses.\n\nQuestion: Which direction do the winds blow from during summer and winter in Phoenix?

{"text": "Education has historically been the vehicle for social mobility. Because of this, white Americans after World War II saw education as a right, one of the limited ways out for the working class. Without an education they were condemned to being minimum wage workers.\nLike Fitzhugh's prophecy, the minimum wage worker has become the modern day wage slave. This status is no longer that of people of color. Even college graduates are today shackled by the minimum wage.\nThe apologists muddle the right to higher education with sayings such as \"Education is a right but should be treated as a privilege\" that puts the onus on the individual, and qualifies the right to mean that everyone should be able to have access to an education, but that access implies the duty of the student to better themselves. In other words, education is not an absolute right.\nIn our society the state controls education; it determines whether something is a right or a privilege. But who controls the state? The bottom-line is we are not all equal. We all have one vote, but the Supremes say the corporations are persons, and that it is unconstitutional to limit the amount they can donate to a political campaign because regulation infringes their free speech rights.\nIt is fallacious to think that I am as free as the Koch brothers who donate a $100 million to political campaigns. It is just as ridiculous to say that minimum wage workers have the same influence as the one top percent.\nIn the United States, all rights are derived from property. Rights imply a corresponding duty of the holder. In theory, the only limitation on the holder's rights is the equal rights of others. According to the founding fathers, the ownership of property was the most important distinction between freedom and tyranny.\nA lot of water has gone under the bridge since the founding. The notion of property has changed over the years, and today property is synonymous with capital. Even real property has become liquid and reduced to a commodity.\nThus education means the accumulation of capital, and emphasis is put on the rights of the holders, and not their duties. Regulations are efforts to regulate the abuse of the holders who look at regulation as suppression of their freedom rather than the enforcement of their duties. In their worldview capital has rights and the worker only has privileges that can only be exercised at the discretion of those with rights.\nIt becomes a worker's duty to work and capital's right to profit from his/her labor. In this brave new world it is becoming increasingly rare for the poor to own land. The only out is to move up through education.\nMexicans fought a bloody revolution that cost over a million lives for social rights. It was not fought for privileges; it was fought for access to land and liberty!\nRights are very dear, and as one writer dramatically put it, \"our rights come from our creator.\" However, they are more fundamental, rights are based on being human. As such government does not have the power to violate a right. Neither does it not have the right to empower corporations to violate our rights.\n\nQuestion: Was education seen as a right by white Americans after World War II? Answer: Yes.\n\nQuestion: Who does the text say our rights come from?

{"text": "Overall, I think this race has been highly misinterpreted. It's not anti-incumbent sentiment. It's anti-Republican incumbent sentiment. In several races we saw incumbent Republicans (I'm looking at you, Crist) lose their seats to Tea Party candidates, some of whom were complete batshit. I'm sorry Greg, but thinking Fluoride in the water is for mind control is just batshit. =) Just like I think anyone who wants to make abortion illegal, even in cases of rape and incest, is not only batshit, but also hateful toward women. But many times we saw those same Tea Party candidates that won against an incumbent Republican lost against the Democrat contender.\nWhat's happening here is party shift, and don't let anyone fool you. The Republican party stopped being conservative about 15 years ago, and just flopped right into a big government money-orgy about 7 years ago (about the time I decided I was a Democrat... coincidence?). THAT is what the people are pissed about, not Democrats. The American people spoke, and what they said was \"Do what you said you will do.\" The right said this by kicking a bunch of fairly moderate Republicans out and replacing them with hardliners who promise to... I dunno, shoot up the place or something in the name of reform. Really, you got me on that one. And what I think the left said to the Democrats was \"Dude... you can't get off your ass to give us what you promised... why should we get off our asses and vote for you?\"\nAnd don't let MSNBC tell you this is just that the Tea Party hates people of color. There is definitely some of that \"Holy crap, those brown/black/muslim 'others' are coming to take my medicare and/or white daughter!!\" Give that another generation, guys. Even generational racism eventually fades. And don't let nobody on Fox tell you this is all about the Democrats, because it isn't. This is straight up about fear.\nFear of outsiders, fear of poverty, fear of joblessness. FEAR. 2008 was the year of Hope, and 2010 is the year of Fear. And that's cool. Everyone gets afraid, from birth to death, you're going to be afraid of something... and sometimes, you're going to fail as a person and allow your fear of whatever to choose for you. That's ok. That doesn't mean things can't get better, and it doesn't mean fear will always run the show.\nWhat needs to happen now is compromise. And by compromise, I don't mean \"We will only compromise if the Dems do precisely what we tell them... and then we'll compromise by voting yes on that thing we demanded.\" This is not compromise, this is a 3 year old throwing a tantrum. So you guys on the right, please get back to business of governing. And you guys on the left, please grow some spine and negotiate with some backbone.\n\nQuestion: What does the author think about the idea that the Tea Party's actions were driven by racism?

{"text": "it is perfectly reasonable to ban smoking in public places, even businesses, provided that some accommodation for smokers is made (if you don't, they won't wait until they are home to smoke, they will just smoke in public anyway).\n\"Smoking is harmful, and regardless of data on secondhand smoke, if there were just a credible risk to bystanders, that would be enough to take precautions on their behalf.\"\nJust how credible is the risk?\nHas the EPA published any reports showing a statistically significant increase in heart attack or lung cancer caused by second-hand smoke?\nWas not the WHO accused of quashing an actual case-controlled study which showed no actual increase of cancer risk in nonsmokers who worked around smokers or who had spouses who smoked? In fact, did not the study show a 22% decrease in lung cancer risk among the children whose parents smoked?\nDoes anyone here have a solid understanding of the foundational studies used to justify public smoking bans, and whether they actually represent good science?\nOn the apartment thing, I was referring to laws like this, where cities are banning smoking in all apartment buildings. The story mentions something like \"second hand smoke invading other apartments\" but as best as I can tell, the actual law just needs any smoking and a complaint.\nAnd yes, I know second hand smoke harms everyone, at least in enclosed areas (thus the support for banning smoking inside government-run buildings); the part I'm not sure about (as I haven't seen the studies; link to me if you have them) is second-hand smoke in open-air areas.\nThe reason healthcare costs aren't a reason for smoking bans is that cigarette taxes already more than cover the healthcare costs without limiting freedom. The best figures I could find were in Great Britain, where the taxes brought in 9 billion pounds, but smokers cost 1.4-1.7 billion pounds. So given that smokers bring in more extra money than they cost in healthcare – by more than 7 billion dollars, why is healthcare cost a reason for further regulation?\nIn early 1993, EPA released a report (Respiratory Health Effects of Passive Smoking: Lung Cancer and Other Disorders; EPA/600/6-90/006 F) that evaluated the respiratory health effects from breathing secondhand smoke (also called environmental tobacco smoke (ETS)). In that report, EPA concluded that secondhand smoke causes lung cancer in adult nonsmokers and impairs the respiratory health of children. These findings are very similar to ones made previously by the National Academy of Sciences and the U.S. Surgeon General.\nThe EPA report classified secondhand smoke as a Group A carcinogen, a designation which means that there is sufficient evidence that the substance causes cancer in humans. The Group A designation has been used by EPA for only 15 other pollutants, including asbestos, radon, and benzene. Only secondhand smoke has actually been shown in studies to cause cancer at typical environmental levels. EPA estimates that approximately 3,000 American nonsmokers die each year from lung cancer caused by secondhand smoke.\n\nQuestion: How many pollutants are in the same group A carcinogen category as secondhand smoke? Answer: There are 15 other pollutants in the same category as secondhand smoke.\n\nQuestion: Does the text mention healthcare costs as a reason for smoking bans?

{"text": "Spatial resolution was in the headlines last week with launch of the DigitalGlobe's WorldView-3 satellite that can produce spectral images with a resolution down to 0.31m. Technologies to produce images at this resolution have been around for some time, but as reported by Reuters in June, DigitialGlobe has only recently received a license from the US Commerce Department to start selling images with a resolution of up to 0.25m; without this licence they wouldn't be able to sell this higher resolution imagery.\nRegulatory involvement in very high resolution imagery was also demonstrated earlier this year, when in January, the UK government blocked the European Commission's effort to set common European regulations on the sale of high-resolution satellite imagery. The UK government currently controls access to data through export licencing conditions on the satellite hardware, and they felt regulations would impact on UK's ability to export space technology.\nTherefore, spatial resolution is an important term, and one every remote sensing client should understand.

The arrival generated many headlines, from the 10 years it took to catch the comet, through the history making first rendezvous and comet orbit, to the final part of the mission and the intention to land on the comet. However there was little detail about the remote sensing aspect of the mission, which we feel is a missed opportunity as it's using many of the techniques and methodologies employed in Earth observation (EO).\nThe orbiter part of Rosetta carries eleven different remote sensing experiments with a wide variety of sensors gathering data about the comet before the lander touches down. Amongst the instruments on-board are three separate spectrometers; a visible and infrared thermal imaging spectrometer (VIRTIS) focussing on temperature and geography; an ultraviolet imaging spectrometer (ALICE) looking at gases and the production of water and carbon dioxide/monoxide; and finally ROSINA has sensors for measuring the composition of the comet's atmosphere and ionosphere.\n\nQuestion: Which government blocked the European Commission's effort to set common European regulations on the sale of high-resolution satellite imagery?

{"text": "In the Shadow of I.W.W.\nIt is a wonder that mention of the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) brings scant recognition from the average person today. In the little over a decade that it flourished, the union evoked intense emotions among its members and detractors. The IWW, whose members were and are known commonly as Wobblies, advocated such radical ideas as an eight hour work day and a forty hour work week, fought and sometimes won bitter freedom of speech fights, championed the causes of mineworkers in Bisbee, Arizona, and struck to improve the working conditions in the textile mills of Patterson, N.J. and Lawrence, Mass. In its heyday, the IWW was almost a household name. Wobblies were hated by many and loved by a few, but most importantly, they played a significant role in the shaping of modern America.\nIn June of 1905, delegates came together in Chicago for the founding convention of the IWW. The convention was a response, in part, to the restrictive organizing efforts of the American Federation of Labor (AFL) along lines of craft unionism and specific areas of manufacture. Moreover, it was a response to the unsafe working conditions, lack of job security, and low wages found in all areas of American industry at the turn of the century. Splintered by ideology regarding the organization of labor, delegates to the first IWW convention conceived a union with a low dues structure and a weak executive board. The power to recall the General Executive Board and for collection of dues rested with the general membership, and that membership would be open to all regardless of gender, race, or occupation. Delegates to the convention included veteran organizers from the Western Federation of Miners, unionists from the AFL and American Labor Union, and members of the Socialist Labor Party. Among the attendees of the convention was Eugene Debs.\nIn the early days of the IWW, much of the American work force labored under poor and dangerous working conditions, and the constant threat of replacement by the waves of immigrants flowing into the United States. Periodic economic recessions added to a climate in which lesser skilled workers were often seen as replaceable commodities. General organizing of workers had been attempted in the late 1800s, most notably under the Knights of Labor, but most people worked without benefit of union contracts. At the time the IWW was founded, the AFL was the most powerful labor institution in the United States, but it largely promoted organizing efforts among white, male, skilled workers. The convention delegates at the first IWW meeting, with no little disdain for the AFL, hoped to expand organizing to include workers across the United States without regard for race, creed, state boundaries, or gender.\n\nQuestion: What was the dues structure and executive board like in the early days of the IWW?

It sets a minimum price for carbon to supplement the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme which requires industry to trade its carbon emissions.

A Bible secured, the ceremony proceeded as scheduled.\nNot every swearing-in ceremony has included a Bible, although there is strong evidence that a Bible has been present in the proceedings since James Buchanan's inauguration in 1857.

There's so much information out there, can we assure people that we will have immigration reform this year?\nFrank Sharry: I'm very optimistic. It's a long and tough legislative process, from 6 to 9 months, and we need to mobilize to demand immigration reform. I'm optimistic because the American people, as evidenced by many polls, are in favor of immigration reform with a path to citizenship. The Democrats are more united than ever, and Republicans need it to survive politically. We can't assure anything, but I think this is a great moment that we haven't seen before.\nRamos: What's different this time? In the past we've failed, we didn't get immigration reform, so what's different?\nKatherine Vargas: The political stage changed fundamentally these last elections, when Latino voters gave a clear mandate that they wanted immigration reform. Now Republicans not only know that they need immigration reform to survive, but they're listening to their conservative base, evangelicals and businesses who are pressuring for reform. So we have all the ingredients for immigration reform this year, and it must happen soon.\nRamos: What didn't we do before, and what are you doing in community groups that is different this time around?\nJorge Mario Cabrera: First of all, making sure in both chambers of congress that we have the necessary votes.\nRamos: How do you make sure of that?\nCabrera: The perspective in the Senate is much better because they know that the Latino vote this time made the difference in many strategic places. But also, there are people looking to the future. This group that now wants to legalize, is the one that is going to elect people in the future, both Democrats and Republicans. Second, there is something very important that needs to be said, that after 10 years, 4 million immigrants have been deported. This is a human crisis that no one can ignore.\nRamos: I've been listening to many Republicans say that we can give them legalization but not citizenship. You and I have talked to immigrants that have told us all they want is to have a work permit and not get deported, why don't you like that idea?\nSharry: I think we're at a point where we can say that we've already won that legalization. However, what we want is an immigration reform that will treat people equally and that will give the option to any immigrant to obtain citizenship if they want it. If not, they'll be in a status without citizenship for their entire life and that's not healthy for them or for our society.\nVargas: Latino voters didn't go out in November to get second class status. They want their brothers and neighbors to have access to citizenship and be like everyone else. Besides, it's not in the Republican Party's best interest to be the party that said no to Latinos, you can't get citizenship, and that went against the immigrant tradition in our country.\nRamos: It's not a good idea to give legalization without citizenship?\n\nQuestion: Does Jorge Ramos think it's a good idea to give legalization without citizenship? Answer: He suggests it's not a good idea.\n\nQuestion: How does Frank Sharry respond to the idea of giving immigrants legalization but not citizenship? Answer: He thinks that after winning legalization, the goal should be an immigration reform that treats people equally and gives the option to obtain citizenship.\n\nQuestion: Is Frank Sharry optimistic about immigration reform happening this year?

We've already met extensively with groups of young people in our community, and we've heard the message, loud and clear, that there are serious issues among them of racial profiling and of experiences with the community that doesn't necessarily recognize them as being equals, and that there is a potential for very negative reactions should the outcome of the Trayvon Martin trial or the stand-your-ground proceedings not be viewed as acceptable to them should the case get dismissed, for example, on a stand-your-ground motion.\nAnd the message that we're promoting is a message that all of that is important and well and good, so long as it is couched in a nonviolent, dialogue-oriented response, rather than in a response of violence. We know, for example, that we can reach a large segment of young people by partnering with young people who are of like mind and who agree with the message of nonviolence, regardless of the outcome of the Trayvon Martin case, of the George Zimmerman case.\nCONAN: I don't know...\nSHOHAT: However, there is a segment of the community which will promote violence and seek violence regardless of anything we say, and we are interested in hearing - and that's why we're convening a youth summit, to focus on how to reach a broader segment of that community.\nCONAN: And I hear that broader address, but I don't know if you have children. If you do, have you had what - the talk that Sean has had with his son?\nSHOHAT: Yes, I have two children, one who's in law school right now, and one who's about to start. And we've had these conversations in the last year and, in fact, in other contexts prior to that with our son and daughter. And I like the messages that I hear back from them. The reality is, as Sean pointed out a few minutes ago, my children are not in the community, the specific community or in the specific peer group, of Trayvon Martin.\nAnd we need to listen to that community very closely as to the messages that they're hearing and the important points that they feel need to be made in order to promote a message of nonviolence.\n\nQuestion: Who is Trayvon Martin?

{"text": "Right now, they're waging a campaign to exclude the sales commissions insurers pay them from the insurers' administrative expenses. Under the federal law overhauling health care, insurers can spend no more than 20 percent of the premium dollars they collect on administrative expenses and profits. At least 80 percent must go toward paying for medical care and quality improvement efforts. This is the medical loss ratio in insurance parlance, medical claims paid are considered losses.\nCalifornia lawmakers are taking another stab at tougher regulation of health insurance rates.\nThe state Assembly has approved a bill that would require health insurers to get approval from state regulators to raise insurance premiums despite a determined effort by the insurance industry to kill the measure.\nThe Assembly passed AB 52, which would give the state's elected insurance commissioner and a second regulator, the Department of Managed Health Care, under Gov. Jerry Brown, authority to reject increases they deem excessive. The regulators also could modify rate increases.\nThis is the fourth attempt by Assembly Democrats to enact tough rate regulation. The bill goes next to the state Senate.\nInsurance Commissioner Dave Jones, who as an assemblyman failed three times to pass a similar measure, applauded the vote, saying it would protect consumers.\n\"Since I took office [in January], Californians have made it exceedingly clear that they want me to reject excessive rate increases, but I do not have this authority,\" Jones said.\nHe said the need for the legislation \"has only grown as health insurance continues to become unaffordable for more and more Californians and businesses.\"\nThe Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) is designed to bring benefits to millions of uninsured Americans by decreasing health care costs and premiums.\nMore than a year since the federal legislation was signed into law, the PPACA has yet to exert downward pressure on these costs and premiums. In fact, the latest reports show an opposite effect. Employers are expected to pay nearly 9 percent more for health care costs for their workers in 2011, the highest level in five years. And employers will more than likely ask their workers to absorb 12 percent of these costs.\nThe future savings predicted by the government also have been questioned because of the sheer cost of the health care reform package—an estimated $940 billion during the next 10 years—and uncertainty about how it'll be funded.\nFor the most part, medical insurers, pharmaceutical manufacturers, medical device makers and even affluent Americans are designated to collectively foot the bill. But some predict these new financial burdens may be passed down and produce cost repercussions for Americans. And both employers and their workers believe health care reform will bring higher costs for both employer-sponsored benefit programs and health care services overall.\nThat's why voluntary benefits present a clear opportunity for brokers during this time of change. Both real and anticipated medical cost increases and the associated shift to less rich medical plans will make voluntary benefits very attractive to both businesses and employees.

{"text": "Thanks\nFT\nI taught from New Inside Out (Pre-Int and Int). It's not really a book suited for preparation to study at university though.\nMy current job is preparing international students to study in western universities, so my advice to you would be to focus on the skills they will need for academic life. How much leeway do you have with the course content? Does it have to be 100% oral English?\nSome ideas...show them some short snippets of video of a lecture on finance or related topics from youtube, just for them to have an idea about lecture/teaching styles and to discover teaching vocabulary that confuses them or that they don't understand at all.\nHave the students prepare short lessons to teach the rest of the class following the short videos (or the textbook if appropriate) as examples. Nothing like having to speak to really get them to learn the material. Teaching may help train their ears for listening to the lecturer too.\nAsk their opinions (individually) a lot, to prepare them for classes where their input is required, and gain confidence in responding in English, even if it's only how to express that they didn't understand the question.\nTo be honest, I think unless you know a great deal about their major you might just want to stay away from that. Maybe point them in the direction of free online academic resources (i.e. itunes u) if they want to learn more.\nGiving them a good foundation of study skills is not a bad idea. Teaching them about cultural differences. Dealing with independent life abroad. Teaching them basic logic via simple philosophical discussions (on ethics, aesthetics, epistemology etc.) is not a bad idea, as they are just not usually thinking this way (which they will be expected to do when they get abroad).\nI teach similar students, and I know there is no way they could legitimately walk into a western classroom and have much of an idea of what's going on. But schools here will take their money and 'teach' them (often focused on helping them simply pass a language test) and schools there will happily take them for the cash. I try not to get too hung up on that and provide them with the basic information and skills they might need in a western academic context.\nThere are also some good websites out there to help prepare students for study abroad that you may be able to incorporate into lessons, such as:\nHave you asked the students if they intend to study abroad? I was given a group to work with two years ago. We were given an IELTS book to work with. When I saw how much trouble they experienced with the book, I polled the class to find out how many of them intended to study abroad.\nAnswer: none of them.\nTo study abroad, they'll have to take the IELTS or TOEFL. Their efforts should be focused on the skills surveyed on those two tests.\nDoes the California uni have a study prep course for international students for a few weeks before regular lectures start?\nMay be useful to see if they do and align your efforts to that.\nFull marks for the commitment you are showing.\n\nQuestion: Should the teacher stay away from discussing the students' major unless they know a lot about it? Answer: Yes, the author suggests this.\n\nQuestion: Does the author suggest focusing on any specific skills for academic life? Answer: Yes, the author suggests focusing on skills needed for academic life.\n\nQuestion: What is one activity the author suggests to help students learn material?

The latest is a \"scintillating bolometer\", a 46-gram device that, in this case, contains a crystal \"scintillator\", made up of bismuth, germinate and oxygen (BGO: Bi4Ge3O12), which acts as a dark matter detector.\n\"This detection technique is based on the simultaneous measurement of the light and heat produced by the interaction between the detector and the hypothetical WIMPs (Weakly Interacting Massive Particles) which, according to various theoretical models, explain the existence of dark matter\", explains García Abancéns.\nThe researcher explains that the difference in the scintillation of the various particles enables this method to differentiate between the signals that the WIMPs would produce and others produced by various elements of background radiation (such as alpha, beta or gamma particles).\nIn order to measure the miniscule amount of heat produced, the detector must be cooled to temperatures close to absolute zero, and a cryogenic facility, reinforced with lead and polyethylene bricks and protected from cosmic radiation as it housed under the Tobazo mountain, has been installed at the Canfranc underground laboratory.\n\"The new scintillating bolometer has performed excellently, proving its viability as a detector in experiments to look for dark matter, and also as a gamma spectrometer (a device that measures this type of radiation) to monitor background radiation in these experiments\", says García Abancéns.\n\nQuestion: What is the name of the device developed by the researchers to detect dark matter?

{"text": "By this theory, if the government enacted a law that banned the use of lead in gasoline, the oil companies would have to be paid not only for the cost of doing so but for any related loss in sales because, for example, people used less gasoline because their cars didn't run as well with unleaded gas. This would effectively tie the hands of the government. As a practical matter, the government would never be able to regulate anything at all. And that, of course, is the point. That's the point of \"judicial libertarianism\": to tie the hands of democracy so that the public sector has no power to do anything.\nThis is a ridiculous theory. Consider a similar situation in which property rights are set like a fly in amber: the invention of flying. In the distant past, it was generally accepted that the space above your property was your own. The government had no right to tell you that you couldn't shoot birds that flew over your property. But then planes came in. People were flying over private property. Sound silly? Maybe so, but there was a court case where a farmer sued to stop planes from flying in his air space. Because the aircraft industry had a lot more political power than the farmer, the courts found the way they almost always do: for the powerful. And as a result, air traffic is a common thing.\nBut not according to Epstein. Or rather, it wouldn't have been according to Epstein a century ago. Now, I'm fairly sure, he would make some argument about how property rights have a limit in their vertical extent. But there is nothing obvious about that. I doubt very seriously that 19th century farmers would have liked the idea that they only owned a finite box of air. And like all libertarian thought, this idea starts to rattle apart with the slightest of pressure from practical implementations.\nThink about what would have happened if the courts had claimed that airplanes couldn't fly over private property without permission. The airplanes would have ignored the laws. The private property owners would have then had to sue the owners. But how would they have known what airplane violated their property rights? And even if they did, they would have to hunt down the owners and then start legal procedures. That would be pretty hard if the plane belonged to a foreign corporation. And what if a hundred planes flew over? A hundred lawsuits? In the end, the property owner would just give up in frustration. So much for your property rights!\nBut let's go back to the leaded gas example. It is more complicated than I just said. Leaded gas is highly toxic; it makes people stupid. Every seller of gas should be culpable for the damage done by the lead that is poisoning society. But in Epstein's world, the government couldn't stop them. So every person who was harmed would have to sue every oil company. And that would be hard because it is pretty much impossible to show individual damages, even when it is trivial to show collective damages. And what about the secondary effect of lead: a more violent society. Should people knifed in the park be able to sue?\n\nQuestion: Who is Epstein in this context? Answer: Epstein is a libertarian thinker whose ideas are being discussed and critiqued in the text.\n\nQuestion: What is the more complicated aspect of the leaded gas example not mentioned earlier in the text? Answer: The text later mentions that in Epstein's world, every person harmed by leaded gas would have to sue every oil company, which would be difficult due to the inability to show individual damages.\n\nQuestion: What is an example given to illustrate the absurdity of this theory? Answer: The example of property rights and the invention of flying is used to show how the theory could lead to impractical and absurd outcomes.", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "8c6fea0d-37f6-4458-a54d-387cb7a4c7d4", "url": "http://franklycurious.com/wp/?blogid=1&archive=2010-10"}

White wine is fine as well but it's hard to depict that in anime. When you're watching Conan, try to look at what Kogoro is drinking. He's often drunk, but that has nothing to do with me!\nQ: Are some of the murder cases are inspired by known mystery novels, or where do you get the inspiration?\nWe do get inspiration from other things, like I mentioned Columbo. The original creator is a huge Sherlock Holmes freak. He creates some things that really go beyond what Sherlock Holmes did. We all love mysteries as well so we read not only Columbo and Sherlock Holmes but many others as well. There is a famous writer in Japan named Keigo Higashino. There are many TV dramas and anime that have been made from his work.\nSo, with Conan I'd like to gain inspiration from those kinds of works. The original work and the anime created by our staff are actually separate. When we create the anime we don't actually touch areas like Kurogo Soushi. This is the organization that gave Conan the drug that turns him into a 7-year-old. We don't touch on the topics like his family and those kinds of areas that are fundamental to the story.\nA: The author (Tadashi Agi) is a friend of mine actually. We started drinking wine at the same time. I went with him to France two years ago and ran in the Bordeaux marathon. It's a marathon but everyone dresses up in cosplay and runs in costume. It's a real full marathon and it takes place in September every year. There are places where you take a break and they have wine at these rest areas. So you run the marathon while dirnking wine. Really, it's true! After about 10 km, Agi-san and I gave up. During this course, I hear the closer you get the goal the wine gets better. So the more you run, the better wine you can drink. We gave up on that because we thought if we did the whole thing we wouldn't have the strength left to enjoy the wine.\n\nQuestion: Who did the speaker go to France with to run in the Bordeaux marathon? Answer: Tadashi Agi, the author of the Conan series.\n\nQuestion: According to the speaker, what happens to the wine as you get closer to the goal in the Bordeaux marathon? Answer: The wine gets better.\n\nQuestion: Who is the author of the Conan series?

Other authors are Andrew Warren, a graduate student in Health Sciences and Technology (HST), and former HST postdoc David Wood.\nSensing thrombin\nBlood clotting is produced by a complex cascade of protein interactions, culminating in the formation of fibrin, a fibrous protein that seals wounds. The last step of this process -- the conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin -- is controlled by an enzyme called thrombin.\nCurrent tests for blood clotting are very indirect, Bhatia says. One, known as the D-dimer test, looks for the presence of fibrin byproducts, which indicates that a clot is being broken down, but will not detect its initial formation.\nBhatia and her colleagues developed their new test based on a technology they first reported last year for early detection of colorectal cancer. \"We realized the same exact technology would work for blood clots,\" she says. \"So we took the test we had developed before, which is an injectable nanoparticle, and made it a thrombin sensor.\"\nThe system consists of iron oxide nanoparticles, which the Food and Drug Administration has approved for human use, coated with peptides (short proteins) that are specialized to interact with thrombin. After being injected into mice, the nanoparticles travel throughout the body. When the particles encounter thrombin, the thrombin cleaves the peptides at a specific location, releasing fragments that are then excreted in the animals' urine.\nOnce the urine is collected, the protein fragments can be identified by treating the sample with antibodies specific to peptide tags included in the fragments. The researchers showed that the amount of these tags found in the urine is directly proportional to the level of blood clotting in the mice's lungs.\nIn the previous version of the system, reported last December in Nature Biotechnology, the researchers used mass spectrometry to distinguish the fragments by their mass. However, testing samples with antibodies is much simpler and cheaper, the researchers say.\nRapid screening\nBhatia says she envisions two possible applications for this kind of test. One is to screen patients who come to the emergency room complaining of symptoms that might indicate a blood clot, allowing doctors to rapidly triage such patients and determine if more tests are needed.\n\nQuestion: What is the new diagnostic system based on? Answer: A technology first reported last year for early detection of colorectal cancer\n\nQuestion: What is the key blood-clotting factor that the new diagnostic system detects?

I would think it definitely would initially, all other things being equal. And the longer the period of the increase, the longer I might expect an increase in temp would last. But that is nothing more than a guess, not science. And I have no idea how much of an increase. Nor do you.\nAnd it is entirely possible that the Earth's climate is such now that it responds to increases and decreases in various forcings in such a way as to remain in a relatively narrow range of temperatures. So admitting that all other things being equal an increased forcing will result in an increase in temp isn't terribly relevant to the debate.\nYou underestimate yourself, Gary. Your answer was not a guess. It was science. An application of your knowledge of physics. If you were more confident in your scientific abilities, you might even try your hand at a crude estimation of ECS, or whatever CS. Between .8C and 2.2C seems plausible, don't it? Just to get you started.\nEven crude estimates of our climate's sensitivity to a doubling of CO2 might prove to be relevant, because it is entirely possible that the Earth's climate is such now that it responds to increases and decreases in various forcings in such a way as to result in at least 3C of warming.

{"text": "Accuracy of Torah Text\nThe great success of Jewish tradition is the meticulous transmission of the Torah text. But actually how accurate is it?\nHow do we know that the Torah we have today is the same text given on Mount Sinai?\nThe Torah was originally dictated from God to Moses, letter for letter. From there, the Midrash (Devarim Rabba 9:4) tells us:\nBefore his death, Moses wrote 13 Torah Scrolls. Twelve of these were distributed to each of the 12 Tribes. The 13th was placed in the Ark of the Covenant (with the Tablets). If anyone would come and attempt to rewrite or falsify the Torah, the one in the Ark would \"testify\" against him. (Likewise, if he had access to the scroll in the Ark and tried to falsify it, the distributed copies would \"testify\" against him.)\nHow were the new scrolls verified? An authentic \"proof text\" was always kept in the Holy Temple in Jerusalem, against which all other scrolls would be checked. Following the destruction of the Second Temple in 70 CE, the Sages would periodically perform global checks to weed out any scribal errors.\nWriting a Torah Scroll\nTo eliminate any chance of human error, the Talmud enumerates more than 20 factors mandatory for a Torah scroll to be considered \"kosher.\" This is the Torah's built-in security system. Should any one of these factors be lacking, it does not possess the sanctity of a Torah scroll, and is not to be used for a public Torah reading.\nThe meticulous process of hand-copying a scroll takes about 2,000 hours (a full-time job for one year). Throughout the centuries, Jewish scribes have adhered to the following guidelines:\nA Torah Scroll is disqualified if even a single letter is added.\nA Torah Scroll is disqualified if even a single letter is deleted.\nThe scribe must be a learned, pious Jew, who has undergone special training and certification.\nAll materials (parchment, ink, quill) must conform to strict specifications, and be prepared specifically for the purpose of writing a Torah Scroll.\nThe scribe may not write even one letter into a Torah Scroll by heart. Rather, he must have a second, kosher scroll opened before him at all times.\nThe scribe must pronounce every word out loud before copying it from the correct text.\nEvery letter must have sufficient white space surrounding it. If one letter touched another in any spot, it invalidates the entire scroll.\nIf a single letter was so marred that it cannot be read at all, or resembles another letter (whether the defect is in the writing, or is due to a hole, tear or smudge), this invalidates the entire scroll. Each letter must be sufficiently legible so that even an ordinary schoolchild could distinguish it from other, similar letters.\nThe scribe must put precise space between words, so that one word will not look like two words, or two words look like one word.\n\nQuestion: What happens if a scribe writes a letter from memory without referring to a kosher scroll? Answer: The scroll is disqualified.\n\nQuestion: How many Torah scrolls did Moses write before his death?

{"text": "Wednesday, August 1, 2007\nAppliances use energy - even when they're off\nThe average American home is brimming with consumer electronics and appliances - televisions, DVD players, stereos, and kitchen gadgets - the list goes on. All of these appliances are great to have when you need them, but they can add to your power bill even when they are turned off. These types of appliances can account for 15 percent of your power bill, and up to 40 percent of the energy they require is used when they are not running. Called \"phantom\" energy use, the power that clock displays, remote controls, and other features use in Off mode can really add up.\nWhile altering the energy requirements of existing appliances is not possible, using consumer electronics mindfully or replacing them with energy efficient models will significantly reduce the amount of energy they require. Following are several ways to reduce the energy consumption of existing appliances:\nunplug chargers for cell phones and other electronics when the equipment is fully charged\nuse a power strip as a central power supply for computers and peripheral equipment, video games, and other electronics. Turn off the power strip when the equipment is not in use.\nenable power management features on your computer, monitor, and other office equipment\navoid using a screen saver on your computer's monitor; allow the monitor to switch to Sleep mode or turn it off when not in use\nWhen it is time to replace an appliance, look for the Energy Star logo. Energy Star is a joint program of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the U.S. Department of Energy. Appliances and other household goods (such as light bulbs) bearing this logo have been designed to meet strict standards for energy efficiency.\nConsumer electronics engineers today design not only for functionality, but for energy efficiency. For example, an Energy Star computer monitor uses up to 85 percent less electricity than a standard model. To earn the Energy Star label, a monitor must be desined to run extremely efficiently in On, Sleep, and Off modes. Requiring less power in Sleep and Off modes ensures that the monitor operates cooler and lasts longer than a standard model. According toe Environmental Protection Agency Energy Star Program, in an average home, using Energy Star office equipment (computer, monitor, printer, fax) could conserve enough electricity to light a home for more than four years.\nLowering energy consumption not only means smaller power bills, but a cleaner environment. The less energy we consume, the less greenhouse gasses are emitted, and the healthier the environment will be. Being mindful of the energy efficiency of any appliance purchased benefits homeowners, business owners, and the community at large.\n3 comments:\nAnonymous\nsaid...\nGreat information so far!

In practice, few doctors are willing or able to perform the delicate procedure.\nFor the abortion of younger foetuses, labour is induced by drugs in the expectation that the infant will not survive the birth process. Guidelines say that doctors should ensure that the drugs they use prevent such babies being alive at birth.\nIn practice, according to Stuart Campbell, former professor of obstetrics and gynaecology at St George's hospital, London, a number do survive.\n\"They can be born breathing and crying at 19 weeks' gestation\" he said. \"I am not anti-abortion, but as far as I am concerned this is sub-standard medicine.\"\nThe number of terminations carried out in the 18th week of pregnancy or later has risen from 5,166 in 1994 to 7,432 last year. Prenatal diagnosis for conditions such as Down's syndrome is increasing and foetuses with the condition are routinely aborted, even though many might be capable of leading fulfilling lives. In the past decade, doctors' skill in saving the lives of premature babies has improved radically: at least 70%-80% of babies in their 23rd or 24th week of gestation now survive long-term.\nAbortionThere's so much to be sad about after reading that article that I hardly know where to begin.\nI read this yesterday and have been sick and depressed since.

{"text": "Yellowstone bison to be vaccinated\nThe state is proposing to vaccinate bison that stray from Yellowstone National Park, a move intended to help prevent the spread of disease to Montana cattle. But some activists oppose the Livestock Department's plan, questioning the vaccine's efficacy. The debate heats up each winter, when some Yellowstone bison wander off in search of food. Ranchers in Montana worry the animals will transmit brucellosis, a disease that can cause cattle to abort their pregnancies. Activists contend the fear is unjustified. \"Why throw taxpayer money down the drain to keep a handful of ranchers happy?\" said Mike Mease of the Buffalo Field Campaign. Steve Pilcher, executive vice president of the Montana Stockgrowers Association, said it is important to take steps to protect the livestock industry. While his group supports the vaccine, it realizes efforts won't necessarily be 100 percent effective. \"But you don't use that as a reason not to try,\" he said. An environmental assessment by Montana's livestock department proposes vaccinating calves and yearlings that leave the park's western boundary and enter the state. The process would take place \"opportunistically,\" the document said, as part of bison management activities. Comments on the plan are being taken through Jan. 5. The department expects to make a decision by Jan. 31. If approved, a program could be in place this winter. Yellowstone bison have been vaccinated before, but it is the first time the state suggested inoculating those that stray form the park. A joint state-federal management plan already allows for the hazing and capture of bison that leaver the park, and for brucellosis testing.

{"text": "Opening a can of worms\nIt might be fair to say that the earthworm is a farmer's best friend.\nFarmers attempt to make their land more productive with the use of fertilisers and the latest equipment for tilling the soil, spending huge amounts of money.\nThe earthworm, on the other hand, achieves the same effect - albeit on a far slower and smaller scale. Earthworm manure is rich stuff, however. By the time the worm has munched through soil, plant material and 'organic litter', many minerals that were previously unavailable to plant roots become available.\nEarthworms play a vital role in both the ecology of soil and the agricultural environment. As Gilbert White observed in his journals, published as The Natural History of Selbourne (1789): \"Worms seem to be the great promoters of vegetation by boring, perforating, and loosening the soil, and rendering it pervious to rains and the fibres of plants; by drawing straws and stalks of leaves and twigs into it; and most of all, by throwing up such infinite numbers of lumps of earth called worm-casts, which, being their excrement, is a fine manure for grain and grass.\"\nIndeed. And it is the role of the humble earthworm in the ecology of the farmer's field that makes the recent discovery, by a team of scientists at Cardiff University, so significant.\nThe researchers found that that the family to which the common earthworm belongs is more diverse than previously thought, and this in turn may have important consequences for agriculture.\nThe UK common earthworm - found in gardens and on agricultural land - is now understood to be composed of a number of distinct species that may have different roles in food chains, soil structure and ecology.\nThe discovery was made unexpectedly when the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC) funded team were looking at ways of developing tools to identify earthworm DNA in the guts of slugs and worm-eating beetles.\nAccording to Dr Bill Symondson, who led the team: \"When we were working to find new tools to detect earthworm DNA we started getting results that were not really what we expected to see and that indicated the presence of several new earthworm species. After investigating this further we eventually found that there are significant numbers of what we call 'cryptic species'. These different species live in the same environment and have the same outward appearance, but do not interbreed and have clearly distinct DNA sequences.\"\nSteve Visscher, Deputy Chief Executive of the BBSRC, adds: \"Maintaining productive land is an important challenge. These researchers didn't set out to find new species of worms but by following up on an unusual observation in their work their work they have uncovered several new species already. This knowledge will be important for many people researching ways to get the most out of our agricultural land in the future.\"\n\nQuestion: What is the potential impact of this discovery on agriculture? Answer: The discovery may have important consequences for agriculture, as different earthworm species may have different roles in food chains, soil structure, and ecology.\n\nQuestion: Who was the first to observe and document the benefits of earthworms in agriculture? Answer: Gilbert White, in his journals published as \"The Natural History of Selbourne\" (1789).\n\nQuestion: What does earthworm manure contain that is beneficial to plants? Answer: Earthworm manure contains many minerals that were previously unavailable to plant roots, making it rich in nutrients for plants.", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "fb6c35bf-7d05-4a38-9164-f3394bc57344", "url": "http://www.theecologist.org/investigations/natural_world/269510/opening_a_can_of_worms.html"}

The term was coined in 1895 by the American philosopher and psychologist William James.[1] The different universes within the multiverse are sometimes called parallel universes.\nThe structure of the multiverse, the nature of each universe within it and the relationship between the various constituent universes, depend on the specific multiverse hypothesis considered. Multiverses have been hypothesized in cosmology, physics, astronomy, philosophy, transpersonal psychology and fiction, particularly in alternate history. In these contexts, parallel universes are also called \"alternative universes\", \"quantum universes\", \"interpenetrating dimensions\", \"parallel dimensions\", \"parallel worlds\", \"alternative realities\", and \"alternative timelines\", among others.\nAuthor Michael Moorcock used a multiverse for many of his works. Central to these works is the concept of an Eternal Champion who has potentially multiple identities across multiple dimensions. The Multiverse contains a legion of different versions of Earth in various times, histories, and occasionally, sizes. One example is the world in which his Elric Saga takes place. The multiplicity of places in this collection of universes include Melnibone, Tanelorn, the Young Kingdoms, and the Realm of Dreams.\n↑James, William, The Will to Believe, 1895; and earlier in 1895, as cited in OED's new 2003 entry for \"multiverse\": \"1895 W.

{"text": "Popping (dance)\nPopping is a street dance and one of the original funk styles that came from California, in the African American community during the 1960s-1970s. It is based on the technique of quickly contracting and relaxing muscles to cause a jerk in the dancer's body, referred to as a pop or a hit. This is done continuously to the rhythm of a song in combination with various movements and poses.\nPopping is also used as an umbrella term to refer to a group of closely related illusionary dance styles and techniques that are often integrated with popping to create a more varied performance, such as the Robot (dance), Waving (dance) and tutting. However, it is distinct from breaking and Locking (dance), with which popping is often confused. A popping dancer is commonly referred to as a popper.\nAs one of the earliest funk and street dance style, popping is closely related to hip hop dancing. It is often performed in battles, where participants try to outperform each other in front of a crowd, giving room for improvisation and freestyle moves that are seldom seen in shows and performances, such as interaction with other dancers and spectators. Popping and related styles such as waving and tutting have also been incorporated into the electronica dance scene to some extent, influencing new styles such as liquid and digits and turfing.\nContents\nAs stated earlier, popping has become an umbrella term for a group of closely related styles and techniques that have often been combined or danced together with popping, some of which are seldom seen outside of popping contexts. However, the use of popping as an umbrella term has been criticized on the grounds that its many related styles must be clearly separated so that those who specialize in more specific styles aren't classified as poppers (ex: a waver, a tutter, a strober).\nIt is often assumed[by whom?] that popping is a style of breakdance. This is due in large part to the movies Breakin' and Breakin 2: Electric Boogaloo. In these movies all styles of dance represented, (breaking and the funk styles: popping, locking, and electric boogaloo) were put under the \"breakdance\" label causing a naming confusion. This caused the media to associate funk styles with hip hop music and assume that popping and electric boogaloo were the same as breaking. The difference between the two is that breaking originated in the Bronx, New York and is danced a lot on the floor while popping and boogaloo got developed in various places in California and are danced almost entirely standing up.\nPopping is centered around the technique of popping (or hitting), which means to quickly contract and relax muscles to create a jerking effect (a pop or hit) in the body. Popping can be concentrated to specific body parts creating variants such as arm pops, leg pops, chest pops and neck pops. They also can vary in explosiveness. Stronger pops normally involve popping both the lower and upper body simultaneously.\n\nQuestion: What are some variants of popping? Answer: Arm pops, leg pops, chest pops, and neck pops.\n\nQuestion: What are some dance styles closely related to popping? Answer: The Robot, Waving, and tutting.\n\nQuestion: What is the criticism regarding the use of popping as an umbrella term?

This speed bump was a great opportunity for the media to pay attention to objections to the White House's reckless executive-branch manipulation of the auto business.\nOr not.\nPresident Bush and his team were regularly savaged by the media elite if they so much as sniffed a hint of evasion over the rule of law and the bounds of constitutional authority in fighting terrorism. So why is President Obama's unprecedented intervention in the auto industry, including a TARP-fund bailout expressly ruled out by Congress, all but ignored?\nEven with the Supreme Court order, the nightly news shows of CBS and NBC gave the decision just a few seconds of air time, the equivalent of a stifled yawn, and never went anywhere near describing the strange bankruptcy proceedings the Obama administration has cooked up to manipulate the industry to its liking.\nOnly ABC acknowledged the Chrysler deal was \"encouraged and engineered\" by the Obama folks, and noticed that lawyers for the pension funds of \"Indiana police, teachers and taxpayers\" were stopping the sale. But even ABC suggested that these state government employees were the bad guys, like vultures hoping that they'd make more money by taking Chrysler apart.\nWhen Enron flat-lined in 2002, these same networks laid the blame all over the Bush administration while breaking out the violins for the people whose retirement funds were ruined. With the car companies and Obama, the song sheet is reversed. No one will go to the home of a retired Indiana cop and wonder why President Obama wants to deny him money for food and pills to sell off Chrysler to a bunch of Italians.\nThen there's the GM deal. Here are some of the anti-Obama arguments from plaintiff lawyers and conservatives that are going ignored on the nightly news.\n1. Nationalization. Obama proposes the government will own 60 percent of General Motors.

{"text": "Laws enacted in July allow for some areas to be made crocodile \"exclusion zones\", with scope to put in barriers to keep the animals from returning. Only one of these has been designated so far: a short section of the Ross River above Aplin's Weir in Townsville.\nBut other zones considered to be at risk have been marked for more intensive patrols and the removal of any animal more than 2 metres long.\nOne of these covers the whole of the Cairns metropolitan area and its northern hinterland and beaches. Most of this zone has been further targeted for \"proactive removal\" of all crocodiles.\nIt all means a ramping up of the activities of the rangers working for Queensland's Environment and Heritage Protection department.\nThey have removed a record 26 animals since the beginning of the year - risking their lives with each capture.\nAnticipating a greatly increased workload, the Government is poised to announce the awarding of a private contract for the tracking and removal of the reptiles from the Cairns area on a 12-month trial basis.\nUnlike the Northern Territory, Queensland doesn't allow culling of wild-caught crocs.

{"text": "Electroactive biofilms were formed from French Guiana mangrove sediments for the analysis of bacterial communities' composition. The electrochemical monitoring of three biofilm generations revealed that the bacterial selection occurring at the anode, supposedly leading microbial electrochemical systems (MESs) to be more efficient, was not the only parameter to be taken into account so as to get the best electrical performance (maximum current density). Indeed, first biofilm generations produced a stable current density reaching about 18A/m(2) while second and third generations produced current densities of about 10A/m(2). MES bacterial consortia were characterized thanks to molecular biology techniques: DGGE and MiSeq® sequencing (Illumina®). High-throughput sequencing data statistical analysis confirmed preliminary DGGE data analysis, showing strong similarities between electroactive biofilms of second and third generations, but also revealing both selection and stabilization of the biofilms. PMID:26055041\nMangroveforests are found within the intertropical zone and are one of the most biodiverse and productive wetlands on Earth. We focus on the Ciénaga Grande de Santa Marta (CGSM) in Colombia, the largest coastal lagoon–delta ecosystem in the Caribbean area with an extension of 1280 km2, where one of the largest mangrove rehabilitation projects in Latin America is currently underway.\n1. In oligotrophic habitats, proliferation of roots in nutrient-rich microsites may contribute to overall nutrient conservation by plants. Peat-based soils on mangrove islands in Belize are characterized by the presence of decaying roots and numerous old root channels (0.1-3.5 cm diameter) that become filled with living and highly branched roots of Rhizophora mangle and Avicennia germinans. The objectives of this study were to quantify the proliferation of roots in these microsites and to determine what causes this response. 2. Channels formed by the refractory remains of mangrove roots accounted for only 1-2% of total soil volume, but the proportion of roots found within channels varied from 9 to 24% of total live mass. Successive generations of roots growing inside increasingly smaller root channels were also found. 3. When artificial channels constructed of PVC pipe were buried in the peat for 2 years, those filled with nutrient-rich organic matter had six times more roots than empty or sand-filled channels, indicating a response to greater nutrient availability rather than to greater space or less impedance to root growth. 4. Root proliferation inside decaying roots may improve recovery of nutrients released from decomposing tissues before they can be leached or immobilized in this intertidal environment. Greatest root proliferation in channels occurred in interior forest zones characterized by greater soil waterlogging, which suggests that this may be a strategy for nutrient capture that minimizes oxygen losses from the whole root system. 5. Improved efficiency of nutrient acquisition at the individual plant level has implications for nutrient economy at the ecosystem level and may explain, in part, how mangroves persist and grow in nutrient-poor environments.\n\nQuestion: What was the proportion of roots found within channels in the mangrove islands in Belize?

When it does, a new interdisciplinary manufacturing venture called the Advanced Manufacturing Technology (AMTecH) group at the University of Iowa College of Engineering's Center for Computer Aided Design (CCAD) will likely help lead the charge.\nAMTecH was formed to design, create, and test—both virtually and physically—a wide variety of electromechanical and biomedical components, systems and processes. Currently, the group is working on projects ranging from printed circuit boards for automobiles and aircraft to replacement parts for damaged and failing human organs and tissue, says Tim Marler, AMTecH co-director.\nThis video is not supported by your browser at this time.\n\"Electromechanical systems are one of two current branches of the AMTecHgroup,\" he says. \"We want to simulate, analyze and test printed circuit boards and assemblies, because they are used in a wide range of products from missiles to power plants to cell phones.\n\"The second branch of the group involves biomanufacturing and is led by my colleague and AMTecH co-director Ibrahim Ozbolat, assistant professor of mechanical and industrial engineering,\" says Marler. \"The long-term goal of this branch is to create functioning human organs some five or 10 years from now. This is not far-fetched.\"\nUsing its facilities for engineering living tissue systems, the Biomanufacturing Laboratory at CCAD is working to develop and refine various 3D printing processes required for organ and tissue fabrication, Ozbolat says.\n\"One of the most promising research activities is bioprinting a glucose-sensitive pancreatic organ that can be grown in a lab and transplanted anywhere inside the body to regulate the glucose level of blood,\" says Ozbolat. He adds that the 3D printing, as well as virtual electronic manufacturing, being conducted at AMTecH are done nowhere else in Iowa.\nIn fact, the multi-arm bio printer being used in the lab is unique. Ozbolat and Howard Chen, a UI doctoral student in industrial engineering, designed it and Chen built it. It turns out that managing multiple arms without having them collide with one another is difficult enough that other printers used in other parts of the world avoid the problem by using simpler designs calling for single-arm printing. As Chen continues to refine his and Ozbolat's design, the UI printer currently gives the UI researchers a distinct advantage.\nWhile bioprinters at other institutions use one arm with multiple heads to print multiple materials one after the other, the UI device with multiple arms can print several materials concurrently. This capability offers a time-saving advantage when attempting to print a human organ because one arm can be used to create blood vessels while the other arm is creating tissue-specific cells in between the blood vessels.\n\nQuestion: Who is the co-director of the AMTecH group and what is his role?

Placed in a terrarium behind pressure sensitive glass, he tempted the frog with live crickets on the other side of the panel. The team then measured the forces on the glass as the frog tried to capture them.\n\"…like the tongue impact and also when the frog was pulling its tongue back trying to detach again from the glass slide,\" he said. \"Then, of course, I also got the tongue print on the glass, after the tongue detached.\"\nKleinteich and his co-workers did 80 trials using four frogs.\n\"What we actually found was that the tongue adhesive forces were well beyond the body weight of these frogs,\" he said. \"And, another thing which we found, which I did not expect, was that the mucus or the slime on top of their tongues does not seem to be that important as people always assumed.\"\nWhile sticky feet can take geckos up walls, Kleinteich says, in one way, a frog tongue may be even more dynamic, because it is blindingly fast.\n\"… in a way that frog tongues [take] only a few milliseconds to actually establish contact,\" he said. \"So it is not like having a piece of tape and to rub it against the wall and wait for a few seconds for [it to stick], [the frog] is immediate, in terms of less than 10 or 20 milliseconds.\"\nAnd since frogs have a diet that ranges from insects to small birds, their tongues can attach to many different surfaces, which Kleinteich says merits more study.\n\"The next steps for me will be, first to study the structure of the tongues and second also to compare multiple species to maybe find more general patterns to find how this mechanism may work.

To study the living, whole brain, the team used a technology known as two-photon microscopy, which allows scientists to look at the flow of blood, CSF and other substances in the brain of a living animal.\nWhile a few scientists two or three decades ago hypothesized that CSF flow in the brain is more extensive than has been realized, they were unable to prove it because the technology to look at the system in a living animal did not exist at that time.\n\"It's a hydraulic system,\" said Nedergaard. \"Once you open it, you break the connections, and it cannot be studied.

This may be what is happening with amyloid deposits in Alzheimer's disease,\" said Iliff. \"Perhaps increasing the activity of the glymphatic system might help prevent amyloid deposition from building up or could offer a new way to clean out buildups of the material in established Alzheimer's disease,\" he added.\n(HealthDay) -- In dominantly inherited Alzheimer's disease, clinical and biomarker changes occur decades before the expected onset of disease symptoms, according to a study published online July 11 in the New England JournalJeddy - How you you KNOW how little we know ? - All this article demonstrates is that we didn't know THIS.

{"text": "EAT THIS\nExplaining brown, white and beige fat\nI'm familiar with brown fat, the primary purpose of which is to regulate body temperature, and white fat cells, which are responsible for storing excess calories. Now something new has appeared in the literature. Researchers have identified that there is another energy-burning but genetically different fat cell found in adult humans that may have the potential to help in the fight against obesity and chronic diseases such as diabetes, and they have called it beige fat.\nIt was previously thought that only babies had brown fat to keep them warm. More recent research has found that adults also have some brown fat, but the brown fat in adults is different than the brown fat in babies. Brown fat in babies comes from muscle, but the brown fat in adults is actually what is being called the new \"beige\" fat and occurs from the \"browning\" of white fat. Beige fat cells are pea-size deposits found just beneath the skin. They are located near the collarbone and along the spine in human adults.\nDuring exercise our muscles release the hormone irisin. Scientists at Dana Farber Cancer Institute isolated the muscle hormone and named it irisin, after the Greek messenger goddess, Iris. This hormone is believed to be responsible for the many of the health benefits of exercise.\nIrisin levels rise when we exercise. Irisin converts ordinary white fat cells into beige fat cells and these cells burn up extra calories. Researchers have long known that the calories burned during exercise exceeded the number used during the actual physical activity. It is believed that beige fat could be responsible for burning these extra calories.\nStory continues below advertisement.\nWhat is interesting is that the muscles also release irisin when the body is cold. This could mean that the beige fat mechanism might have developed as a response to shivering, which, like exercise, is classified as a neuromuscular activity. The conversion of cells to beige is not necessarily permanent. Senior author Bruce Spiegelman believes that the increase or decrease depends on physiological conditions such as age, sex and obesity level.\nThis might explain why more brown fat and perhaps more beige fat is present in people who are physically fit and active versus those much less fit. Both brown and beige fat contain a plethora of mitochondria, the power plants of cells that convert food into energy and generate heat. Both types contain iron as well, which gives them their distinct brown and beige tones.\nThe hope is that one day beige fat cells will lead to new treatments for obesity and diabetes. Further research will be crucial to determine whether anything useful can come from this discovery. Some of the questions researchers would like to know more about include:\n• How much beige fat is there?\n• Why do some people have a greater or lesser proportion of it than others?\n• How can it be used to help people lose weight?\n• Is there a way that the production of beige or brown fat can be stimulated over white fat to increase fat breakdown?\n• Is there a place in all of this for drug therapy?\nAlways looking for a new twist, the diet gurus already have started recommending cold and shivering as an alternative to exercise. Spiegelman says forget about it. It would be a pretty uncomfortable therapy\n\nQuestion: What is the difference between brown fat in babies and adults?

{"text": "Silicene, a single-atom thick layer of silicon, could beat graphene to the components market due to the industry's familiarity with silicon and its properties.\nGraphene is a truly wondrous molecular structure. Since its discovery a few years ago, scientists have become more and more excited about the possibilities graphene affords. It is the most conductive material in the known universe with surprising optical qualities, and IBM has shown that graphene could allow computers to operate close to the terahertz range (one terahertz, or THz, is equal to roughly 1,000 gigahertz, or GHz). The problem is that graphene does not have a band gap. A band gap is the difference in energy from an on state, where electrons are flowing through a circuit, and an off state, where no electron motion is possible. Without a band gap, it's extremely difficult to build transistors, which have to be able to switch from \"on\" to \"off\" and back again very quickly. Some progress in creating a band gap in graphene has been made, but the material is still years or possibly decades away from being used in current computer components.\nNow, research has been released from multiple research groups around the planet announcing the creation of silicene, a one-atom thick layer of silicon equivalent to graphene. This presents a lot of promise to researchers and engineers, because silicene, being based on silicon, should be compatible with current electronics and electronic fabrication techniques. The research groups created the silicene sheet by condensing silicon vapor onto a silver substrate. Currently, we only have proof that silicene exists, as the scientists observed it through a scanning tunneling electron microscope, but they theorize that silicene should have highly desirable electrical properties, perhaps even close to the electrical conductivity of graphene.\nThe next step is to grow silicene on an insulator, so that it can be used to create a circuit. At least four research groups managed to successfully create silicene on a silver substrate, so it's highly likely that they're working to find an insulator that will allow them to repeat their success. With silicon reaching the physical limits of its capabilities sometime in the next decade, silicene could be exactly what the electronics industry needs.\n\nQuestion: What is the potential benefit of silicene for the electronics industry? Answer: It could be exactly what the electronics industry needs, as silicon is reaching its physical limits\n\nQuestion: What is the main challenge faced by graphene in being used in current computer components?

Technically, you cannot \"see\" anything smaller than the shortest wavelength of light that you can see it with. But there are ways to \"visualize\" it, like Atomic Force Microscopy. But these are all just measurements converted to computer images, and are not in any real sense \"seeing\" the atom. You can't see atoms in any normal sense of using an optical microscope. You don't get an optical image, but it does allow you to map out an image of the atoms of a molecule. To do this you use a metallic tip which interacts with the atoms you want to image. As you move the tip over the atoms, you pass a current, called a tunneling current, between the tip and the atom. This current is extremely sensitive to the distance between the atom and the tip.\n4\n- REMEMBER FROM: Elements, Mixtures, and Compounds - Element - a pure substance made up of one type of atom. - organized on periodic table - each element has a unique protons number of protons…its atomic number\n8\nA.

Be it large, small or average a penis is a wonderful organ and a source of great enjoyment for the person it's attached to, and anyone else who is sharing the sexual experience. Isn't that all that matters?\nSilvertip, it definitely looks like you are not lying. I would say that the main problem is that the guys who say they are between 7 - 8.5 post legit pictures here.... and the guys between 5.25 - 6.25 girth post legit pictures....but quite often people post these outlandish figures here and without pics to even give an estimate. It's annoying....\nGold Member\nWhat is legit? I mean, some days I am harder than others and my dick seems longer. Arousal levels vary and effect size. I have my, \"on a good day, I measure...\"\nThe bone press figure is good for stats, but you may be giving yourself an extra unseen 1/2 inch. So, does body fat percentage effect size. And, the penis length actually continues inside the body. So now there is true size, (bone pressed), and visual size, (measure only what you can see.) I think you mean visual size, (a term I just made up), because if you are careless and gain 10-20 pounds in weight/ fat, you lose 1/2 inch of visual size. Did the penis shrink? No, its the same size, it just does not look as big.\nSome people measure with the bone pressed in. This is different for everyone. Some can gain an inch this way, some only a half inch, and some only a corner.\nSome measure along the side. A lot of people do this, especially here, and this is why I think you get some outlandish measurements. This will nab you AT LEAST a .5 inch/half in then what you really are. Not just that, but so many kids and just normal people measure like this. Not calling us guys not normal, but clearly we're in to measuring or have just overall been exposed to measuring via the internet. But the other guys, the guys who aren't into the whole internet or measure constantly...probably only measure every now and then and do it by the side.\nAnd guess what? This is what causes people's minds to be boggled with how some can't understand how the average is only between 5-6. I mean, have you EVER spoken to someone with a penis length between 5-6? I haven't. I'm only 19 though, and straight, so I don't see them...and people my age would never admit it.\n\nQuestion: What does the term \"bone press figure\" refer to?

{"text": "By definition, you're not supposed to be able to dissolve or revoke an irrevocable trust, but there are exceptions to every rule. You probably designed your trust to serve a certain purpose, and when it's met that purpose, your selected trustee can close it. There are limited ways you can terminate your irrevocable trust during your lifetime as well.\nRevocation by Consent\nWhat a trust can and cannot do is usually governed by state law. Many states allow for the dissolution of an irrevocable trust if you and your beneficiaries all agree to it in writing. Consent must be unanimous, and complications can arise in some states if any of your beneficiaries are minors. For example, New York law does not allow a minor to make such a decision, and his parents can't give his consent for him.\nCourt Intervention\nSome states, such as Georgia, permit dissolution of an irrevocable trust if you, your trustee or a beneficiary file a petition with the court to terminate it. You'd need good cause, but this option wouldn't require the consent of everyone involved. Typically, the court would want to know that some harm would come to the trust's assets or to its beneficiaries if it were permitted to continue. The assets with which you funded your irrevocable trust – and which you gave up control over when you created it – usually distribute to your beneficiaries if your trust is dissolved prematurely. They may not revert back to your ownership.\nThe Trust's Purpose\nAfter your death, the terms of your trust are pretty much carved in granite. Even revocable trusts become irrevocable when the trust maker dies. Your trustee must either distribute all the trust's assets to beneficiaries immediately, or the trust will continue to operate so it can achieve the goals you set out in your trust documents. For example, you might have written in spendthrift language because your son is your primary beneficiary, but you know he's not good with money. You can direct your trustee to mete out distributions to him over a period of many years rather than give him a large lump sum all at once. In such a case, your trust would continue to exist, at least during his lifetime. If you set up an irrevocable life insurance trust instead, you may want all your beneficiaries to receive the death benefits immediately. In this case, the insurance proceeds would be payable to your trust, your trustee would distribute the money to your beneficiaries, and the trust would then close.\nFinal Steps\nWhether your trust closes immediately after your death or lives on for a while to serve your intentions, it must eventually close. This typically involves payment of any outstanding debts or taxes before the trustee distributes the trust's assets and income to your named beneficiaries. In some states, your trustee must submit a formal accounting of the trust's operation to all beneficiaries. This can be a complex report, particularly if the trust existed for many years. Trustees can sometimes waive this requirement if all beneficiaries agree in writing. In either case, after the report is made, the trust's assets can be distributed and the trust can be dissolved\n\nQuestion: Can a trust set up to protect a spendthrift beneficiary continue after the grantor's death? Answer: Yes, it can continue to operate to achieve the goals set out in the trust documents.\n\nQuestion: Can a minor give consent to dissolve an irrevocable trust in New York? Answer: No, and their parents cannot give consent on their behalf.\n\nQuestion: What is the final step in dissolving a trust? Answer: Distribution of the trust's assets and income to the named beneficiaries, and payment of any outstanding debts or taxes.", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "b153ac6d-1ed3-4201-915d-aea608d8f4f5", "url": "http://finance.zacks.com/dissolve-irrevocable-trust-8194.html"}

{"text": "4 Negative Side Effects of a High-Caffeine Diet\nJune 23, 2016\nAlthough we're a fast-paced culture in need of coffee, soda, and energy drinks, excess consumption of caffeine can actually have a negative impact on our diets. At Ultimate Health & Weight Loss in Watchung, NJ, nutritionists recommend moderation when it comes to caffeine intake—especially if you're getting your fix via sugary sodas and energy drinks.\nFour Negative Side Effects of Consuming Too Much Caffeine\nHeartburn\nCaffeine relaxes the esophagus, which can often lead to heartburn. Ingesting caffeinated beverages on an empty stomach can also cause indigestion and other stomach problems.\nRestlessness & Anxiety\nMost people consume coffee and other energy drinks to get a jolt of energy when they first wake up; however, drinking too much caffeine leads to the jitters and restlessness throughout the day. As a stimulant, caffeine increases the production of adrenaline hormones in the body. This produces heightened sensitivity to external stimuli and often results in feelings of anxiety, as well as racing thoughts, confusion, and even rambling speech.\nDehydration\nCaffeine increases blood flow to the kidneys, resulting in the need to urinate more frequently. People who drink too much caffeine urinate often and may also have bouts of diarrhea, which also causes dehydration and disrupts the body's balance of electrolytes.\nHigh Blood Pressure\nAccording to a study funded by the American Heart Association, caffeine raises one's blood pressure, even in individuals who are otherwise totally healthy. Doctors recommend limiting coffee consumption to 24 ounces per day; they also encourage people to avoid drinking coffee before or after exercising, which naturally raises your blood pressure.\nWeight loss is one of the many reasons people drink excessive amounts of caffeine, but it's not the healthiest way to do so. If you want to lose weight safely and keep it off, turn to Ultimate Health & Weight Loss in Watchung. They offer the NutriMost system, which is a technology-based program that targets fat and toxins at the cellular level.

The error some people do is to believe human-arms should be intrinsically better at a job than mechanical limbs which do not look human-like. But if an extra weapon with a near-360° radius can kill an enemy before you can physically aim your \"main\" weapon, you increase your chance of survival.\nDoing my own addition here : if you were to control them well enough, those extra-arms could also serve the double purpose of taking/absorbing impact from an incoming Beta, thus maximizing your chances of survival.\n>>11606459 >all those weapons which can't be aimed without some fragile super special computer sight\nThat shit is just fucking retarded. For all the work, programming, and training it would take for something stupid like that too work you would be better off just removing the human operator from the loop entirely. You don't gain anything by having him there.\nThose rockets in particular are completely asinine, enjoy having the back-blast burn you alive. Not to mention what is the point of having a normal assault rifle strapped to the side of your arm like that? The only thing you have accomplished is making it harder to aim and clear a jam. This shit honestly looks like a rejected design from exo squad. I'm sorry but this crap is pure garbage no matter how you try and look at it.\nAnother subject, I've been wondering that a civilization capable of rewinding through time (or at least make information travel back in time... plus blood-related plot-hole) would have a pretty interesting philosophy of life.\nIt all come down to the idea that even if someone rewind through time, it doesn't mean those who were \"left in the past-present\" don't continue to live on. so : (1) Does this civilization aim for only one successful time-line ? or (2) Does this civilization endorse the creation of distinct time-line ?\nIn the first case it would mean that every time they would lose something that is dear for them they would rewind in time to make it right. None of them could ever die. Their history would be a continuous road of success. Failed to conquer a planet ? Rewind time. Lost an important part of yourself in a dangerous experiment ? Rewind time. Failed to create the best party ever for all time traveler ? Rewind time.\nIn the second case it would mean that subspecies or chunk of their civilization are free to go on their own business, try reckless things and/or break contact with the rest of them. Their history would subdivide across infinite number of time-line and never really care about those who failed on their first try. Also I get a \"who care about morality ?\" vibe. Exterminating all other species is no big deal since they might survive in another time-line.\n\nQuestion: Does the text mention any drawbacks to having weapons that can't be aimed without a special computer sight? Answer: Yes, it mentions that they would be difficult to aim and clear jams, and could potentially harm the operator with back-blast.\n\nQuestion: What does the text suggest about the feasibility of using weapons that can't be aimed without a special computer sight? Answer: It suggests that it would take too much work, programming, and training to make them effective, and that it would be better to remove the human operator from the loop entirely.\n\nQuestion: What is one potential benefit of having extra weapons with a near-360° radius?

You have captured the essence of what it means to be human: to have a little bit of light and dark in every one of us. And while we might begin a little biased towards one side or another, it is ultimately our choices and the power of love that define us.

Would we learn about the magical traditions of the Cherokee or the Apache?

How could they cast spells through their ritual song and dance? How might they view \"No-Majs\" differently from European cultural norms? What if instead of disdain, they held the utmost respect for non-magicals – for those people had to be the most imaginative to invent ways to go about their daily lives where magic could not ease their paths?\nBut while well-written and certainly heart-tugging, I was simply left with another sour-cream-white traumatic orphan sob story (not to trivialize whites, orphans, or tragedies that numerous people face) that was eerily reminiscent to Harry's orphaned past and defeat of a dark wizard through the power of love.\nAnd I get it, Jo.

{"text": "Preferred food: Werewolves prefer meat of any kind, though they are omnivores, and can live as vegetarians if they must. Few werewolves have qualms about eating humans, since werewolves consider them to be a separate, if related, species.\nRun on all fours or two? Most werewolves will run on all fours, though they can run on two legs if they have to carry something.\nBody type (bulky, hunched, lithe, more wolflike, etc... feel free to link!) : Varies more than human body types, they can be sleek, bulky, and anything in between.\nLifestyle - More time as wolf or human? Most werewolves spend their time in wolf, or halfway form. Some will take human form and live among humans, but most only take human form when they have to deal peacefully with humans, and then revert to something wolfish at home.\nForms (human, wolf, beast/anthro, etc): All werewolves can take wolf form, and most can take a two legged form, that retains a wolf's head, tail, fur and claws. Many werewolves can also take a full human form, though in some they still have fangs, pointy ears or an unusual amount of hair. Occasionally a werewolf will be born in human form and be unable to change. These are called Misborns and due to their lack of protective fur, and teeth capable of eating raw meat, they rarely survive to adulthood. Some packs will kill a Misborn, but most will care for it to the best of their ability until it succumbs to an infection or the elements. Those misborns left with humans to be raised, grow up with feelings of confusion about their species, and will attempt to return to the pack if they and out what they really are.\nShifting Cause (moon, free will, ritual, etc.): Werewolves change of their own free will. The only exception to this is when a werewolf in human form feels threatened. Their body will attempt to revert to a form with natural weapons, most werewolves can control this by concentrating, but if the danger requires their full attention they are likely to shift involuntarily.\nShifting Process (is it painful? fast? Can they do it on the run?): For most werewolves shifting hurts about as much as popping your knuckles, if it were happening in ever joint of your body. Some also report itching or tingling as their hair grows in or retracts. In a significant minority of cases the werewolf will feel pressure in its scull and experience headaches, these usually go away after a period of time. Werewolves who suffer from these usually do not change the shape of their face unless they have to.\nAbilities retained in human form: Werewolves generally have better hearing then humans, and a slightly more sensitive nose. These are noting compared to what they have in wolf form, since they are using human organs to sense, but more of their brain is devoted to processing this information than a humans. For this same reason werewolves often have poor eyesight.\n\nQuestion: How does the shifting process feel for most werewolves? Answer: For most werewolves, shifting feels like popping knuckles all over the body, and may also involve itching or tingling as hair grows or retracts.\n\nQuestion: What are the different forms a werewolf can take?

Though he hasn't played competitively in almost two years and refused to work out for most teams, the Cavaliers looked at him multiple times, leading to speculation they could select him over the widely-admired Irving (likely a smoke screen, but you never know). Biyombo is a Congolese player who was an unknown one year ago, but after a standout performance at the Nike Hoop Summit, he's skyrocketed into the high lottery. Vesely was known more for his dunking mixtapes than his playing acumen, but now he could be asked to rescue a crappy team. The lack of information and playing footage hasn't prevented them from getting looks, but it's harder for fans to feel confident in these relatively untested prospects.\nWith the negotiations leaving salary flexibility unknown, it makes sense that teams would try to draft for need and plug existing concerns rather than shooting for the moon—indeed, players like Fredette and Walker have looked like promising-if-limited players in pre-draft workouts, while Kanter, Biyombo, and Vesely could develop into dependable role players. The lack of talent may make teams re-configure their draft-day expectations, and look for a rotation banger rather than a franchise star. It could also make them get more desperate to strike big.

{"text": "LYMPHEDEMA BY NICOLE MORRIS\nWhat is Lymphedema, and Who is at Risk? Lymphedema is a preventable condition that may affect people who have undergone certain kinds of cancer treatment. A woman who is in treatment for breast cancer is at risk for developing lymphedema when she has had a lymph node biopsy (also called a 'sentinel node biopsy'), or a chain of lymph nodes surgically removed during lumpectomy or mastectomy. There is also a risk associated with radiation therapy, if the radiation was applied to the underarm or outer chest wall.\nLymphedema is Caused by a Compromised Lymphatic System The lymphatic system is responsible for collecting and processing lymphatic fluid, which is made of water, protein, and cell debris within the body. The lymph nodes filter this fluid as it passes along the lymph pathways. Hundreds of lymph nodes are located all throughout the body, but the largest groups are found in the neck, underarms, abdomen, and groin. When lymph nodes are surgically removed or radiated, they are unable to repair themselves, and their absence can cause a blockage in the pathway. Lymphedema is the accumulation of the blocked fluid in the affected area, causing mild to severe swelling, discomfort, decreased function, and an increased risk of infection.\nPrevention and Treatment Prevention and early diagnosis are critical for those who are at risk. Lymphedema can occur very rapidly, and it responds best to treatment in the earliest stages. The treatment for mild to moderate (Stage 1 and 2) lymphedema usually consists of bandaging, exercises, gentle massage, nutritional counseling, training in preventive behaviors, and strict hygiene practices for proper infection control. In the later stages, the condition may require corrective surgery. Please refer to the for more information.\nWhere Can I Find Out More? There are many valuable resources for breast cancer survivors who need information or treatment options for lymphedema. Please refer to the list of resources available on the . Most importantly, if you are at risk for developing this condition, or have already been affected, be sure to consult with your doctor. With education and vigilance, you will be able to prevent or treat lymphedema, and raise your overall quality of life after cancer treatment.\nMarch 2013\nNicole Morris, LMT/CMLDT is a Licensed Massage Therapist practicing Oncology Massage and Manual Lymph Drainage in Birmingham, AL.

{"text": "Glaucoma\nGlaucoma is a group of eye diseases that gradually steal sight without warning. In the early stages of the disease, there may be no symptoms. Experts estimate that half of the people affected by glaucoma may not know they have it.\nVision loss is caused by damage to the optic nerve. This nerve acts like an electric cable with over a million wires. It is responsible for carrying images from the eye to the brain.\nThere is no cure for glaucoma – yet. However, medication or surgery can slow or prevent further vision loss. The appropriate treatment depends upon the type of glaucoma among other factors. Early detection is vital to stopping the progress of the disease.\nIt was once thought that high pressure within the eye, also known as intraocular pressure or IOP, is the main cause of this optic nerve damage. Although IOP is clearly a risk factor, we now know that other factors must also be involved because even people with \"normal\" levels of pressure can experience vision loss from glaucoma.\nOpen Angle Glaucoma (OAG)\nThis is the most common form of glaucoma, affecting about three million Americans. It happens when the eye's drainage canals become clogged over time. The inner eye pressure (also called intraocular pressure or IOP) rises because the correct amount of fluid can't drain out of the eye. With open angle glaucoma, the entrances to the drainage canals are clear and should be working correctly. The clogging problem occurs further inside the drainage canals, similar to a clogged pipe below the drain in a sink. In open-angle glaucoma, the optic nerve is slowly damaged, usually causing gradual loss of vision. Both eyes can be affected at the same time, although one may be affected more than the other. Sometimes much of your eyesight can be affected before you notice a change.\nMost people have no symptoms and no early warning signs. If open angle glaucoma is not diagnosed and treated, it can cause a gradual loss of vision. This type of glaucoma develops slowly and sometimes without noticeable sight loss for many years. It usually responds well to medication, especially if caught early and treated.\nSymptoms of Open Angle Glaucoma\nIf you have open-angle glaucoma, the only symptom you are likely to notice is vision loss. You may not notice the vision loss until it is severe, because your less affected eye at first makes up for the loss. Side (peripheral) vision is usually lost before central vision.\nClosed Angle Glaucoma (CAG)\nClosed-angle glaucoma is less common, accounting for about 10% of all glaucoma cases in the United States. In closed-angle glaucoma, the colored part of the eye (iris) and the lens block the movement of fluid between the chambers of the eye, causing pressure to build up and the iris to press on the drainage system (trabecular meshwork) of the eye. It may cause sudden blurred vision with pain and redness, usually in one eye first; symptoms may also include nausea and vomiting.\nTypically medications are intended to reduce elevated intraocular pressure and prevent damage to the optic nerve.\nSymptoms of Closed Angle Glaucoma\n\nQuestion: Which part of the eye is affected in Closed Angle Glaucoma (CAG)?

Nedved\nRequest for Comments: 946 Carnegie-Mellon University\nMay 1985\nTELNET TERMINAL LOCATION NUMBER OPTION\nStatus of this Memo\nThis RFC proposes a new option for Telnet for the ARPA-Internet\ncommunity, and requests discussion and suggestions for improvements.\nDistribution of this memo is unlimited.\nOverview\nIn a community of users that share a large degree of common\nfacilities, it is often advantageous to use some common feature to\nimprove software performance and reduce initial implementation costs.\nIn March of 1982, CMU designed and implemented based on the growing\nCMU PUP-based network a terminal location database and modified\nexisting network software to handle a 64-bit number which some call\nthe Terminal Location Number or TTYLOC for short. The number can be\nefficiently stored in operating systems tables and can be passed\nbetween various levels of operating system and network layering with\nminimum modifications to existing software. An initial evaluation of\nchanging software to communicate an unfixed or reasonable length\nterminal location string indicated it would be expensive.\nCMU now wishes to extend this mechanism into the TCP-based networking\nsupport that is replacing the existing PUP-based software. The\nmechanism is not viewed as a replacement for the Telnet Terminal\nLocation (SEND-LOCATION) Option but as a shorthand mechansim for\ncommunicating hosts in the same community.\nTTYLOC Number\nThe TTYLOC number is a 64-bit number composed of two (2) 32-bit\nnumbers: The 32-bit official ARPA Internet host address (may be any\none of the addresses for multi-homed hosts) and a 32-bit number\nrepresenting the terminal on the specified host. The host address of\n[0.0.0.0] is defined to be \"unknown\", the terminal number of FFFFFFFF\n(hex, r or-1 in decimal) is defined to be \"unknown\" and the terminal\nnumber of FFFFFFFE (hex, or -2 in decimal) is defined to be\n\"detached\" for processes that are not attached to a terminal.\nNedved [Page 1]\nRFC 946 May 1985\nTelnet Terminal Location Number Option\n1.

{"text": "Embedded Lab\nTuesday, September 22, 2009\nThe 1-Wire Communication Protocol\nThe 1-Wire is a registered trademark of Dallas Semiconductor Corp (now Maxim) for a serial communication protocol using a single data line and a ground reference. A 1-Wire Master (a microcontroller) initiates and controls the communication with one or more 1-Wire Slave devices (usually sensors). Each 1-Wire slave device has a unique, factory-programmed , 64-bit identifier, which serves as device address on the 1-Wire bus. This globally unique address is composed of eight bytes divided into three main sections. Starting with the LSB, the first byte stores the 8-bit family codes that identify the device type. The next six bytes store a customizable 48-bit individual address. The last byte, the most significant byte (MSB), contains a cyclic redundancy check (CRC) with a value based on the data contained in the first seven bytes. This allows the master to determine if an address was read without error. With a 248 serial number pool, conflicting or duplicate node addresses on the net are never a problem.\nThe 1-Wire protocol uses conventional CMOS/TTL logic levels (maximum 0.8V for logic \"zero\" and a minimum 2.2V for logic \"one\") with operation specified over a supply voltage range of 2.8V to 6V.\nA Typical 1-Wire Communication Flow\nThe first part of any communication involves the bus master issuing a reset, which synchronizes the entire bus. A slave device is then selected for subsequent communications. This can be done by selecting all slaves, selecting a specific slave (using the registration number of the device), or by discovering the next slave on the bus using a binary search algorithm. These commands are referred to collectively as network function or read-only-memory (ROM) commands. Once a specific device has been selected, all other devices drop out and ignore subsequent communications until the next reset is issued.\nOnce a device is isolated for bus communication, the master can issue device-specific commands to it, send data to it, or read data from it. Because each device type performs different functions and serves a different purpose, each type has a unique protocol once it has been selected. Even though each device type may have different protocols and features, they all have the same selection process and follow the command flow seen in the figure below.\nI am going to show you how to connect a DS1820, a 1-Wire digital temperature sensor, to a PIC microcontroller.\nWe are now going to implement this circuit in our PIC16F628A development board.

{"text": "A study from 2008 compared children and dogs raised in Mexico City (a location known for high pollution levels) with children and dogs raised in Polotitlán, Mexico (a city whose pollution levels meet the current US National Ambient Air Quality Standards).[6] According to this study, children raised in areas of higher pollution scored lower in intelligence (i.e. on IQ tests), and showed signs of lesions in MRI scanning of the brain. In contrast, children from the low pollution area scored as expected on IQ tests, and did not show any significant sign of the risk of brain lesions. This correlation was found to be statistically significant, and shows that pollution levels may be related to, and contribute to, brain lesion formation and IQ scores, which, in turn, manifests as impaired intellectual capacity and/or performance. Living in high pollution areas thus places adolescents at risk of premature brain degeneration and improper neural development—these findings could have significant implications for future generations.\nThere are indications that the effects of physical activity and air pollution on neuroplasticity counteract. Physical activity is known for its health-enhancing benefits, particularly on the cardiovascular system, and has also demonstrated benefits for brain plasticity processes, cognition and mental health. The neurotrophine, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is thought to play a key role in exercise-induced cognitive improvements. Brief bouts of physical activity have been shown to increase serum levels of BDNF, but this increase may be offset by increased exposure to traffic-related air pollution.[7] Over longer periods of physical exercise, cognitive improvements that were demonstrated in rural joggers were found to be absent in urban joggers taking the same 12-week start-2-run training programme. [8]\nResearchers in Chile found statistically-significant correlations between multiple air pollutants and the risk of epilepsy using a 95% confidence interval.[9] The air pollutants that the researchers attempted to correlate with increased incidence of epilepsy included carbon monoxide, ozone, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, large particulate matter, and fine particulate matter. The researchers tested these pollutants across seven cities and, in all but one case, a correlation was found between pollutant levels and the occurrence of epilepsy. Interestingly, all of the correlations found were shown to be statistically significant. The researchers hypothesized that air pollutants increase epilepsy risk by increasing inflammatory mediators, and by providing a source of oxidative stress. They believe that these changes eventually alter the functioning of the blood–brain barrier, causing brain inflammation. Brain inflammation is known to be a risk factor for epilepsy; thus, the sequence of events provides a plausible mechanism by which pollution may increase epilepsy risk in individuals who are genetically vulnerable to the disease.\n\nQuestion: Which of the following was NOT found to correlate with increased incidence of epilepsy in the Chilean study?

{"text": "In her Harvard Business Review article, Coutu called resilience \"one of the great puzzles of human nature, like creativity or the religious instinct.\" Indeed, a recurring theme in the research literature is that resilience is complex. According to Brooks and Goldstein, it is not something that can be discovered or attained like a \"fountain of youth.\" They emphasize that the process of building and maintaining the characteristics of resilience requires ongoing dedication. The authors point out, however, that these characteristics are tangible and within reach. \"The more you are aware of the features that nurture resilience,\" they write, \"…the better prepared you will be to promote resilience and stress hardiness in yourself.\"\nOther experts agree. The American Psychological Association (APA) offers a publication on the topic of resilience, which states, \"Resilience is not a trait that people either have or do not have. It involves behaviors, thoughts, and actions that can be learned and developed in anyone.\" By learning ways to build resilience, sufferers of chronic illness may be able to improve the quality of our lives.\nJoanna Wasmuth, founder of Harmony Coaching Group and a fibromyalgia sufferer, is a speaker, author, and life coach who teaches people to thrive in spite of chronic pain. \"I have learned the anatomy of a comeback,\" she said in a recent interview, \"over and over and over.\" Wasmuth emphasized that resilience is something that can be learned. \"I think of resilience as a muscle,\" she said. \"When you go to work out, it hurts the first couple of times and you can't really do that much with it. But as you work out more and more, it gets stronger and stronger.\"\nRichard Davidson, Ph.D., professor and director of the Laboratory for Affective Neuroscience at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, explains that one way people can \"train the brain\" to be more resilient is through the use of meditation. His research focuses on neuroplasticity, the capacity of the brain to develop and change throughout life. He became best known for his work demonstrating meditation's direct impact on the structure and function of the brain. Says Davidson, \"Meditation probably doesn't calm emotions per se but is likely to facilitate more rapid recovery following a negative event.\" In one study (Davidson et al., 2003), 25 subjects were enrolled in an eight-week meditation training program and compared to a control group. Measurements of electrical activity in the brains of both groups revealed increased activation in the brains of the meditation group, in the area of the brain typically associated with positive affect and resilience. Says Davidson, \"These are individuals who, when adversity occurs, will recover more quickly.\"\nMore research is needed to fully understand how all the facets of resilience come together. Couto noted that resilient people often don't seem to have an awareness of this quality in themselves. \"Resilience is a reflex,\" she writes, \"a way of facing and understanding the world that is deeply etched into a person's mind and soul.\"\n\nQuestion: Can resilience be learned and developed in anyone, according to the American Psychological Association?

{"text": "Another way that scientists can track what a sea turtle eats is by making observations either out in the ocean or in a lab. Finding a sea turtle in the ocean is rather difficult, but scientists have developed devices such as satellite tags and time depth recorders (TDR) that give scientists the ability to track sea turtles. A satellite tag allows scientists to track the location of sea turtles. Satellite tags are also used on many different animals around the world. First, a tag must be placed on an animal and then it can be tracked. For sea turtles, the tag looks like a small box with an antenna coming out of it. The tag is glued to a sea turtle's shell and then the sea turtle is released back into the ocean. Every time the sea turtle surfaces, the tag sends out a signal to a satellite in the sky and the satellite sends the information to the scientists. The satellite tag collects information on the turtle's location, the temperature of the water, how deep the turtle dives, how long the turtle stays underwater, etc. Since scientists can track the location of sea turtles, they can observe firsthand what it forages on in the wild. Sometimes these observations can be made without satellite tags. For instance, if scientists can identify foraging spots, then no satellite tags are needed. A time depth recorder is a device that can be placed on a sea turtle and it records the depth of the dive, the duration of the dive, and the time spent at the surface. This type of technology is advancing and now scientists can even put small video recorders on sea turtles. This allows them to see exactly what a sea turtle is preying upon!\nSea Turtles in Marine Food Chains\nAll species of sea turtles play a vital role in marine ecosystems. As adults, they are usually at the top of marine food chains and food webs and they are considered keystone species. They help to maintain populations and prevent an over-abundance of their prey items. For instance, leatherbacks play a role in controlling large populations of jellies. If jelly populations get out of control, then they will eat a large number of juvenile fish causing impacts on commercial fishing.\nScientists are discovering that the grazing of green sea turtles on sea grasses can positively affect the growth of sea grasses. The sea turtles cause a good disturbance of the sea grass beds and that promotes growth and discourages aggressive species of sea grasses from taking over beds. Scientists are also seeing this same effect with hawksbills and sponges.\nMarine Debris\n\nQuestion: How do scientists track a sea turtle's location in the ocean?

{"text": "The Rodgers Creek fault (RCF) is a principal component of the San Andreas fault system north of San Francisco. No evidence appears in the historical record of a large earthquake on the RCF, implying that the most recent earthquake (MRE) occurred before 1824, when a Franciscan mission was built near the fault at Sonoma, and probably before 1776, when a mission and presidio were built in San Francisco. The first appearance of nonnative pollen in the stratigraphic record at the Triangle G Ranch study site on the south-central reach of the RCF confirms that the MRE occurred before local settlement and the beginning of livestock grazing. Chronological modeling of earthquake age using radiocarbon-dated charcoal from near the top of a faulted alluvial sequence at the site indicates that the MRE occurred no earlier than A.D. 1690 and most likely occurred after A.D. 1715. With these age constraints, we know that the elapsed time since the MRE on the RCF is more than 181 years and less than 315 years and is probably between 229 and 290 years. This elapsed time is similar to published recurrence-interval estimates of 131 to 370 years (preferred value of 230 years) and 136 to 345 years (mean of 205 years), calculated from geologic data and a regional earthquake model, respectively. Importantly, then, the elapsed time may have reached or exceeded the average recurrence time for the fault.

Besides this, \"the memories\" do simply not exist in Antigua due to their destruction by English destroying everything which are \"not English\". Apart from these, to create a nation there must be some \"forgetting\" process which means the Antigua in colonial times should be completely erased, for her the independence of the Island is not erasing the colonial Antigua: firstly, the economy of the country is based on tourism (give the tourists the best of what they 'expect', make them happy and serve them) secondly, the corrupt rulers are favoring themselves rather than 'constructing' images to show independence, and lastly, the ones who have money do only give their money to renovate the old institutions, than building new ones. Then for her, the nations are build up by the people on social institutions, which 'creates', remembers or erases the memories.\nLast time, we have seen how the history can be silenced through the narration: the narratives and narrators were doing it together to silence some events which are actually happened in \"the past\" (as a location) to favor the present (another location which is causally related to \"the past\").The ideas of one location there, have been imposed to the other location with the help of \"the location of past\", the subjectivity on picking up the events to be recorded in history leaves us no space to express our opinions in present location. Kincaid expresses that what if the events which happened in the super-past were destroyed by the past and the present remains same as the past because there is no change in the past? As we see in the Antigua case. There is no history, no story, no national narrative, because of having no access to printed sources of knowledge, lack of institutions to create such knowledge and industry to print these sources. For her the history is destroyed and it is wanted to be remained as destroyed, therefore the things are repeating themselves.\n\nQuestion: According to Kincaid, why was Antigua unsuccessful in creating a nation? Answer: Due to having no or few national memories, and the lack of access to libraries and books that could provide these memories.\n\nQuestion: According to Kincaid, what is the relationship between the present and the past in Antigua? Answer: The present remains the same as the past because there is no change in the past, leading to a repetition of events.", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "6cb87d43-9c72-4c55-9f7a-c07fe6d9669b", "url": "http://slhnrmn.blogspot.com/2011/09/white-man-came-with-peace-on-kincaids.html"}
{"text": "So it's no secret that my kiddos were having some issues during read to self. We were not exactly reading during our school wide reading time...even though we all had our books out. A lot of my kids were just hanging out with an open book...not so productive. It was seriously driving me CRAZY!\nI felt like I was loosing precious minutes of instructional time while my kids did their best to fake read. It was turning into a huge problem for me and it turned out to have a two part solution.\nFirst, I taught my kiddos the difference between fake readers and real readers. I blogged about that part of the solutionHERE.\nThe other part of the solution was reteaching picking the right book. I had gone over the idea at the beginning of the year but had never really taught a lesson on the whole concept so I decided to start from scratch.\nI scoured blogland and pintrest...my usual first line of defense...and came up with this lesson:\nI started by telling them I picked out a brand new book for read aloud and that I was really excited about it. I pulled out The Life of Benjamin Banneker from my bag and started reading aloud with my usual enthusiasm Then I said, \"Turn to your neighbor and predict what will happen next\". *Crickets* A couple of kids tried to come up with something but most just looked at me like I was crazy. Which was exactly what I wanted!\nI said, \"You all are supposed to be making predictions. What seems to be the problem?\" One of my superstars replied, \"Well I really tried to listen but some of the words were really hard and I really couldn't understand the plot. I think that's a high school book or something.\"\nToo which I quickly replied, \"Okay, so your telling me this book is too difficult because the words are too hard and you didn't quite understand what was going on. That's okay because I picked up a couple of other books while I was at the bookstore.\"\nThen I pulled out Don't, Danny, Don't! I read three pages and then asked them to predict. They laughed and said \"Of course we know what is going to happen. That's a baby book!\"\nJust before I pulled out the final book I heard one of my students tell her neighbor, \"This is just like Goldie Locks and the Three Bears. We Can't find the right book.\" That's when I knew the lesson was going in the right direction. :)\nFinally a pulled out James and the Giant Peach. I read 3 pages in my best read aloud voice. My kiddos were hooked! I asked them to predict with their neighbor. There were insightful murmurs all over the room.\nI was smiling. My kids were smiling. All was right in the world.\nThen we had a quick discussion on why James and the Giant Peach was an appropriate book and why the others were too easy or too difficult for us.\nWe used that info and created this anchor chart:\n(Sorry it's so out of focus!)\n\nQuestion: How did the students describe the second book? Answer: The students described the second book as a \"baby book\" and said they knew what would happen in it.\n\nQuestion: What was the name of the third book the teacher used as an example? Answer: James and the Giant Peach\n\nQuestion: What two-part solution did the teacher come up with to address this issue? Answer: The teacher decided to teach her students the difference between fake readers and real readers, and to reteach picking the right book.", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "1036271e-3988-4a4d-a70e-17791fdcd385", "url": "http://lattesnlaughter.blogspot.com/2012/"}
{"text": "France seems to be a country of polymaths, and ideas. There is a long and very respectable history of this, which included people like Descartes, Lavoisier, and even Voltaire, who in addition to being a philosophical novelist, went to England to seek out Newton. This reverence for knowledge has not gone away. When teaching a course in Paris, an engineering student brought me a Baudelaire poem to illustrate a point I had made in a previous lecture. This is a wonderful intellectual and historical curiosity, and can lead people down the path of publications. It doesn't however lead to the type of specialization that would be considered basic research. Over lunch at a university south of Paris, I spoke with the head of the chemistry department about specialization. He nostalgically recalled a time 200 or so years ago when it was possible to learn all of the known scientific knowledge available. He recognized that this is no longer possible, yet his romantic longing for such broad knowledge must in some ways translate to his research, which is at a very high level, but not focused enough to be modern Nobel Prize innovation. I can certainly relate to this, as I am not only interested in various disciplines of science, but equally in music, poetry and art. If he is frustrated not to be able to know everything scientifically, imagine how frustrated I am? Still this ideology is revealing. As with the other differences it leads me to wonder which comes first, the lack of funding, or the lack of focus to achieve the funding.\nAs we are all aware the United States is a highly competitive place, where innovation has historically led to some major advantages. It may very well be that our government labs and leaders are savvier than I have often given them credit for. There may very well be a realization that research is the best way to fuel technology, which in turn grows the economy. It is hard however to think that Europe doesn't have as much of this focus. After all, Chancellor Merkel of Germany is a Ph.d Physical Chemist, where most of our leaders couldn't pass high school physics. I think though that research just happens to be the place where American economic interests are currently best served. It is business, not science that is in fact inspiring the science. So thinking of research as a business, it becomes easier to see how Europe may be behind. Starting a business in Europe is a much more difficult process than doing it in the United States. I have done both. It is also something, which in France at least, is not as sought after. While I mentioned that scientists are respected in Europe, I get the sense that entrepreneurs are more respected in the United States. I have heard some of the best ideas from colleagues here in Paris for inventions. These ideas would be the seeds for patents and new companies in the United States. In France they become research papers, or subjects for lectures. It is likely therefore that a government would not see the financial returns of research investment without first reforming barriers to create companies, and the mindset that goes with it.\n\nQuestion: What did Voltaire do in England? Answer: He went to England to seek out Newton.\n\nQuestion: Who are some notable polymaths from France's history? Answer: Descartes, Lavoisier, Voltaire\n\nQuestion: What would these ideas from colleagues in Paris likely become if they were in the United States? Answer: They would be the seeds for patents and new companies.\n\nQuestion: What is the head of the chemistry department nostalgic about?

{"text": "20. Share with others.\nOur souls are little, near-constantly chattering things. But we don't often listen to them. We get caught up in our lives and simply don't hear our souls and the messages they have to offer from previous lives. If anything, these are four big things your soul wishes you knew.\n1. You're fine.\nSeriously. Your soul watches you lurch through life always wondering, always doubting yourself, and feeling so insecure so often. But your soul knows that in the long run, societal pressures and insecurities don't matter much. You're fine. You can always look to develop yourself, and your soul would be delighted by that! But you do it on your terms.\n2. You're meant to feel deeply.\nYour soul wants you to know that there's nothing good that will come out of brushing aside your experiences and ignoring your feelings. You were meant to feel deeply – and that means everything. So feel all your feelings.\n3. You're here to experience life.\nThat's the very definition of being alive. We're supposed to go on adventures, to go travel, to fall in love, to have families, or to not have families if that's what we prefer. But we're intended to live our lives the way we want to and to the absolute fullest.\n4. Your soul wants you to do your best.\nIf you do your best, you'll be surprised at all the things you end up accomplishing. And if you come up short, how can anyone beat you up for it? How can you hold it against yourself? You did your best, and that's all any reasonable person, including your soul, could expect of you.\nSounds pretty awesome, right? Finally, the Tesla dream of wireless energy is here. Hold on though, because it's not exactly what you think. You won't soon be able to charge your tablet or smart phone with existing Wi-Fi routers.\nThe authors of thispiece of researchclaim that they operated a small camera 20 feet from a router. The camera used a Wi-Fi signal to charge a capacitor, allowing it to to snap an image every 35 minutes.\nTechnically, it could very well power a small device at some point. However, your phone still uses too much power for something like that to be effective. The average cell phone is about a million times more energy sucking than the tiny camera is.\nDecades ago, Nikola Tesla pondered the possibility of a technology like this coming to life. He believed you could power things without wires. He didn't, however, invent anything that could. Now it looks like there's an opening to it being possible, but it's hard to say whether or not the technology will come to fruition.\nOr if it will be allowed to come to fruition.\nBut it has been officially proven that we can charge things with Wi-Fi. Just not very energy intensive things.\n\nQuestion: What does the soul want the individual to do regarding their feelings?

Announced on Tuesday, Virginia resident students who have temporary legal status under the federal Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program can also receive in-state tuition from public colleges and universities. The announcement comes after republicans in the state's General Assembly blocked DREAM Act legislation earlier this year.\nAbout 8,100 young people in Virginia have temporary legal status under DACA, which allows high school graduates who came to the United States as children to work legally if they have no criminal record and are enrolled in school or discharged from the military. The impact of in-state tuition is huge in the life of an individual. For example, while in-state tuition for University of Virginia in the coming year totals $12,998, prior to this announcement, DACA recipients who are Virginia residents would have had to pay an out-of-state tuition of $42,184. Many young people who receive scholarships cannot claim them due to immigration status. These students could be valuable assets to local economies and communities, but out-of-state tuition fees make it difficult for hard-working, bright DACA students to consider college a possibility.\nSince the failure of the federal DREAM Act in 2010, 19 states have passed legislation giving some form of in-state tuition to undocumented young people. We are excited that Virginia will be joining these other states in allowing DREAMers equal access to financial resources for higher education. Every student deserves the opportunity to pursue higher education and reach for his or her dreams.\n\nQuestion: What is the DREAM Act?

Also known as the Asian Lady Beetle or the Japanese Ladybug, it invades homes and businesses in October in preparation for hibernation.\nIt occurs in three main colour forms- red or orange with black spots, black with four red spots, and black with two red spots. The species is typically large – 7 to 8 mm long and it is more dome shaped the native European species. The Harlequin Ladybird is to be found in its highest numbers in the South East of England.\nExperts are predicting that the anticipated warm summer will provide perfect conditions for the Harlequin Ladybird. Unlike British ladybirds, the Harlequin Ladybird does not need a cold winter for adults to reach sexual maturity and so to be able to breed. This means that they can breed in their billions and, wreak havoc in homes and businesses if left untreated.\nAlthough the Harlequin Ladybird does not spread disease, it bites children and adults and emits a rotting smell, staining surfaces with an orange coloured discharge. It thrives over any harsh winter and unlike the British Ladybird it spends the winter hibernating in cracks in residential and commercial buildings.\nIf you're experiencing problems with an infestation of these ladybirds, professional treatment is the only solution to effectively getting rid of them. The treatment programme would consist of one initial treatment and, wherever possible the entry points to the property that the ladybirds are using would be blocked.

{"text": "The Peel Papers: The American Civil War\nThe surviving diaries of Albert L. Peel, Adjutant of the 19th Mississippi Infantry, reveal the daily life of a soldier on the march and in camp. Born July 14, 1841 at the family home of Hickory Park in Chulahoma, Mississippi (part of Marshall County), Albert attended the prestigious Kentucky Military Institute (KMI) until the onset of the war. He enlisted with his brothers: Robert, the eldest, a physician, Thomas, the next eldest, a married man, and younger brother Addison, who like Albert was at KMI. Andrew Jackson Peel, already moved away to Texas, enlisted there, served for a few days before securing a \"substitute\" and the youngest brother Volney was only 15 in 1861, however this youngest brother would enter the war before its conclusion.\nLike most soldier diaries, the longest entries are written when time ran slow. Battles are not covered in any great detail because at those times Peel was too busy to write much, hence Gettysburg is covered in about three short paragraphs. Even so, Peel's meticulous tracking of his unit's movements across the countryside as well as his record of various friends and kinsmen as they came through the camp.\nDr. Robert Hunter Peel was born September 30, 1832 at the family home in Alabama and moved to Mississippi as a toddler. He became the head of the family at the age of 15 when his father died in 1846. Robert was married to Virginia Matthews, the daughter of Ballard D. Matthews. Their daughter Fannie died in infancy and Virginia died about the same time. At the time of the war's start, widower Robert was working as a physician, tended only by his aunt Jane, the youngest of his father's many siblings, a retarded woman in her early 40s.\nFrom before the war's start throughout the horrific months of combat, Robert kept in touch with his sister-in-law Maude, Virginia's younger sister.

(National Air and Space Museum Archives, Smithsonian Institution)\n24 September 1929: Lieutenant James H. Doolittle, U.S. Army Air Corps, made the first completely blind airplane takeoff flight and landing, solely by reference to instruments on board his aircraft. Flying from the rear cockpit of a civil-registered two-place Consolidated NY-2 Husky training airplane, NX7918, Doolittle had his visual reference to earth and sky completely cut off by a hood enclosure over his cockpit. A safety pilot, Lieutenant Benjamin Scovill Kelsey, rode in the forward cockpit, but the entire flight was conducted by Doolittle. He took off from Mitchel Field, climbed out, flew a 15 mile set course and returned to Mitchel Field and landed.\nThe experimental gyroscopic compass, artificial horizon and a precision altimeter were developed by Elmer Sperry, Jr., and Paul Kollsman, both of Long Island, New York. Funding for the Full Flight Laboratory at Mitchel Field was provided by the Daniel Guggenheim Fund for the Promotion of Aeronautics.\nThe following contemporary magazine article gives some details of Jimmy Doolittle's instrument flight:\n\"THE outstanding development in aviation recently, and one of the most significant so far in aviation history was the 'blind' flight of Lieut. James H. Doolittle, daredevil of the Army Air Corps, at Mitchel Field, L. I., which led Harry P. Guggenheim, President of the Daniel Guggenheim Fund for the Promotion of Aeronautics, Inc. to announce that the problem of fog-flying, one of aviation's greatest bugbears, had been solved at last.\n\"There has been 'blind flying' done in the past but never before in the history of aviation has any pilot taken off, circled, crossed, re-crossed the field, then landed only a short distance away from his starting point while flying under conditions resembling the densest fog, as Lieut. 'Jimmy' Doolittle has done, in his Wright-motored 'Husky' training-plane. It was something uncanny to contemplate.\n\"The 'dense fog' was produced artificially by the simple device of making the cabin of the plane entirely light-proof. Once seated inside, the flyer, with his co-pilot, Lieut. Benjamin Kelsey, also of Mitchel Field, were completely shut off from any view of the world outside. All they had to depend on were three new flying instruments, developed during the past year in experiments conducted over the full-flight laboratory established by the Fund at Mitchel Field.\n\nQuestion: Who developed the experimental gyroscopic compass, artificial horizon, and precision altimeter used in the flight?

{"text": "Interesting stuff. I have some quibbles with the idea that whether x-elements developed into prepositions or postpositions \"depended on which basic clausal word order developed\" in a language, though: Classical Latin is pretty strongly SOV, but also strongly prepositional; and it's not at all clear to me that Greek, one of the most markedly \"free word order\" IE languages, can be said to have a basic SVO order, or any basic order at all.\na George said,\n— why should \"because\" have an argument at all? The expression is disdainful of the opinion of others, and that could be perfectly transmitted by just leaving out any further term. Much like the sort of child-upbringing in which you would stop any argument by saying \"because\". At least it used to mean \"because I say so\", but as the child learnt the lesson, \"because\" became quite sufficient. Hence, in my view, it is not a humurous departure but mere disdain.\nphspaelti said,\nThe (apparently) unique development in English was the evolution of that from a pronoun into a complementiser,…\nIn what sense is this development unique to English? I was always under the (naive?) impression that this this represented a cognate with German daß.\nOr perhaps this is supposed to be unique in Germanic (viz. Indo-European)?\n[(myl) You left out the rest of the unique stuff: \"… and the general development of the possibility of deleting it (e.g. in verbal complements and relative clauses as well as in cases of the sort under construction)\".]\nMatt_M said,\nI second Craig's comment that Prof. Pullum's examples seem completely grammatical. But we don't need to rely on our own intuitions here: we can look at whether native English speakers use the structure. Googling for the string \"because I believe of\" yields three and a half million ghits, and a quick scan of the results confirms that the great majority of the results on the first few pages involve a parenthetical \"I believe\" inserted between \"because\" and \"of\" and that these results are written by competent speakers of English. A large proportion of the results are from Google Books (trying the same search term on Google Books yields about 10,000 hits) — that is, they are extracts from carefully edited prose and not just slips of the keyboard.\nI thought Prof. Pullum's examples were grammatical but trivial to the discussion. Just because you can put \"boldly\" between \"to and \"go\" does not mean that \"to go\" is not the infinitive in the phrase. So to, simply because you can put a parenthetical set off by commas between \"because\" and \"of\" does not mean that in some sense \"because of\" is not a unit.\nThat said, I agreed with Prof. Pullum's thesis, I just thought those particular examples to be beside the point.\nMichael Watts said,\n\nQuestion: Is Greek an SVO (Subject-Verb-Object) language? Answer: It's not clear; Greek has a marked \"free word order\".\n\nQuestion: What is the unique development of \"that\" in English, as mentioned by phspaelti? Answer: Its evolution from a pronoun into a complementiser, and the general development of the possibility of deleting it in certain contexts.\n\nQuestion: According to George, why might \"because\" not have an argument? Answer: To express disdain or dismiss an opinion, similar to a child saying \"because I say so\".\n\nQuestion: What is the word order in Classical Latin?

{"text": "Distributors\nEvery time we hear that \"artificial intelligence\" was behind something – from creating images to inventing recipes to writing a description of a photo – we thought was uniquely human, you'll see someone worrying about the dangers of AI either making humans redundant, or deciding to do away with us altogether. But the real danger isn't a true artificial intelligence that's a threat to humanity – because despite all our advances, it isn't likely we'll create that.\nWhat we need to worry about is creating badly designed AI and relying on it without question, so we end up trusting \"smart\" computer systems we don't understand, and haven't built to be accountable or even to explain themselves.\nSelf-taught expert systems\nMost of the smart systems you read about use machine learning. It's just one area of artificial intelligence – but it's what you hear about most, because it's where we're making a lot of progress. That's thanks to an Internet full of information with metadata; services like Mechanical Turk where you can cheaply employ people to add more metadata and check your results; hardware that's really good at dealing with lots of chunks of data at high speed (your graphics card); cloud computing and storage; and a lot of smart people who've noticed there is money to be made taking their research out of the university and into the marketplace.\nMachine learning is ideal for finding patterns and using those to either recognize, categorize or predict things. It's already powering shopping recommendations, financial fraud analysis, predictive analytics, voice recognition and machine translation, weather forecasting and at least parts of dozens of other services you already use.\nOutside the lab, machine learning systems don't teach themselves; there are human designers, telling them what to learn. And despite the impressive results from research projects, machine learning is still just one piece of how computer systems are put together. But it's far more of a black box than most algorithms, even to developers -- especially when you're using convolutional neural networks, commonly known as \"deep learning\" systems.\n\"Deep learning produces rich, multi-layered representations that their developers may not clearly understand,\" says Microsoft Distinguished Scientist Eric Horvitz, who is sponsoring a 100-year study at Stanford of how AI will influence people and society, looking at why we aren't already getting more benefits from AI, as well as concerns AI may be difficult to control.\nThe power of deep learning produces \"inscrutable\" systems that can't explain why they made decisions, either to the user working with the system or someone auditing the decision later. It's also hard to know how to improve them. \"Backing up from a poor result to 'what's causing the problem, where do I put my effort, where do I make my system better, what really failed, how do I do blame assignments,' is not a trivial problem,\" Horvitz explains; one of his many projects at MSR is looking at this.\n\nQuestion: What is one of the challenges of using deep learning systems? Answer: They can't explain why they made decisions, making it difficult to improve or audit them.\n\nQuestion: Is the text primarily discussing the potential dangers of a fully realized artificial intelligence?

{"text": "Sickle Cell Anemia News and Research\nSickle cell anemia is a serious disease in which the body makes sickle-shaped red blood cells. \"Sickle-shaped\" means that the red blood cells are shaped like a \"C.\" Normal red blood cells are disc-shaped and look like doughnuts without holes in the center. They move easily through your blood vessels. Red blood cells contain the protein hemoglobin. This iron-rich protein gives blood its red color and carries oxygen from the lungs to the rest of the body. Sickle cells contain abnormal hemoglobin that causes the cells to have a sickle shape. Sickle-shaped cells don't move easily through your blood vessels. They're stiff and sticky and tend to form clumps and get stuck in the blood vessels. (Other cells also may play a role in this clumping process.) The clumps of sickle cells block blood flow in the blood vessels that lead to the limbs and organs. Blocked blood vessels can cause pain, serious infections, and organ damage.\nResearchers from Instituto de Medicina Molecular Lisboa have found that the host's susceptibility to develop malaria depends on his or her metabolic state, which can be easily manipulated through external stimuli such as dietary patternsPersonalized cancer therapies are on the horizon thanks to a new genomic cancer research partnership between the Gene Editing Institute of Christiana Care Health System's Helen F. Graham Cancer Center & Research Institute and the biotechnology company NovellusDx.\nA study published on May 17 in Nature, discovers an innovative method to produce infinite supply of healthy blood cells from the readily available cells that line blood vessels. This achievement by the researchers at Weill Cornell Medicine marks the first time that any research group has generated such blood-forming stem cells.\nA team led by Pr. Marina Cavazzana conducted at Necker Children's Hospital, AP-HP and the Imagine Institute in October 2014 gene therapy in the context of a phase I clinical trial / II in a patient 13 years with severe sickle cell disease.\nA team of physicians and laboratory scientists has taken a key step toward a cure for sickle cell disease, using CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing to fix the mutated gene responsible for the disease in stem cells from the blood of affected patients.\nThe National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, part of the National Institutes of Health, has awarded a 6-year, $4.4 million grant to St. Jude Children's Research Hospital and collaborators to improve the use of prescribed medication by sickle cell patients.\nPatients with sickle cell anemia (SCA) develop heart complications and nearly a quarter die a sudden death. Now, researchers have linked malfunctioning molecular pathways to specific heart anomalies in SCA that result from progressive fibrosis and result in sudden death.\nResearchers, led by Carnegie Mellon University President Subra Suresh and MIT Principal Research Scientist Ming Dao, have created a new computer model that shows how tiny slits in the spleen prevent old, diseased or misshapen red blood cells from re-entering the bloodstream.\n\nQuestion: What causes sickle cells to clump together?

And I personally LOVE it!\nWhen I draw it I call it \"doodling\"…and I adore drawing doodles!\nThough for quite some time I have noticed that most of the drawings are geared toward adults or older students. I have felt as if younger people have been left out. I realize, I am guilty, too. When I have created doodle drawings in the past, I was thinking of middle to upper elementary students. I kept looking at my youngest child (that I will begin homeschooling in just a few short weeks…if I can get my courage up) and wondered if there was something I could do for him. After talking with a colleague about potential uses for doodle drawings, the idea came up to create educational coloring sheets for younger learners! Brilliant! {I LOVE brainstorming with my genius friends!}\nAnd so Doodle Color by Number and Shape worksheets were born…\n(these are specifically geared toward younger children)\nSince my youngest will be starting into school AND needing to work on fine motor skills I created these doodle coloring sheets. He will be able to work on number and shape recognition all while having fun coloring and strengthening those little hand and finger muscles! Side note: I am getting more excited {less terrified} of teaching my son this year!\nNot only will I be helping him with these vital skills, but they will also allow him to work independently. And boy is that empowering as a little person!? {Confession: it also allows his teacher to complete other tasks and not need to watch his every move!)\nWhat I love about these worksheets is that a child will learn to recognize numbers and shapes through a fun coloring activity. And when they have finished coloring the sheet, they look amazing! I have included a variance of difficulty. This allows for students to be challenged by the size of the coloring area, which in turn really works on those important fine motor skills. (oh, and as a bonus, I included 4 pages of addition and subtraction doodle color by number worksheets.)\n\nQuestion: What is the author's current feeling about homeschooling their child?

{"text": "Thursday, January 28, 2010\nThe next time an NFL team pleads for public financing for a stadium and needs to argue for the public benefit to the community, it should consider the bet made between the Indianapolis Museum of Art and the New Orleans Museum of Art.\nWednesday, January 13, 2010\nIt has come to my attention that Idaho's governor, Butch Otter, has proposed a budget that contains cuts to education and parks. Naturally, the public is up in arms... which is just what I think the governor wanted.\nI think Governor Otter is looking for political capital to increase taxes, using the time-honored strategy of presenting the most popular services as the first ones to be cut. For example, any time anyone wants to cut public broadcasting, \"Sesame Street\" is the first show headed for the chopping block, and President Obama got rid of the world's most advanced fighter jet rather than some other military program. So, obviously, the only way to save these popular programs is to pony up more money.\nNow, some would say that Governor Otter is opposed to tax increases, and perhaps he is, personally. But in his role as governor, he has to favor higher taxes and more services, because it increases the power of his office to distribute benefits to the people who elected him, and makes those same people more reliant on his re-election.\nThere's another time-honored method the state could use if it wanted to pay expenses the voters didn't want - lawsuit funding. Under this plan, organizations that are facing budget cuts sue the state for some reason or another, and the state mounts an ineffective defense (or, if nobody in the press is paying attention, defaults). The state is ordered to make the payments, and the politicians get to blame the \"activist judges\" for ruining their sure-fire plan to end government waste.\nMonday, January 11, 2010\nThis seems like a mistake, as the first-generation models are likely to be so expensive that only the wealthy and powerful can afford them, and you would think that the wealthy and powerful don't really lack for lovers. Oh, sure, you could pitch in with some of your buddies and co-own one, but that might be unsanitary.\nThe second problem is that the market for robot lovers has fallen off since its peak demand in the late 70s and the 80s, when robot love was as popular as Cabbage Patch dolls and ninjas. Don't believe me? Try the following examples:\n\nQuestion: When was the text written? Answer: The text was written in January 2010.\n\nQuestion: What is the author's view on the market for robot lovers? Answer: The author believes that the market for robot lovers has declined since its peak in the late 70s and 80s.\n\nQuestion: What is the author's opinion on Governor Otter's budget cuts? Answer: The author suggests that Governor Otter is using budget cuts to popular services to gain political support for tax increases.", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "3589e595-7884-406f-998c-0349bd49ed99", "url": "http://patronsaintofmediocrity.blogspot.com/2010/01/"}
{"text": "People fall in love with the \"idea,\" versus the reality. Having a wife/husband, boyfriend/girlfriend, best-friend or getting married etc., is wonderful but the reality is that, it's what you make it and that can be positive, negative or both. I'm not saying that falling in love with the idea of something is bad but when you fall in love with the idea and try to change a person, control them and their surroundings, that is when the idea is bad. When we look at social media, we see so many people showcasing their love for another person and as we are looking at those individuals, we might feel out of the loop and lonely and that is when the idea enters into our mindsets and that is when we fall head first with the idea of having someone to call our own or go to the next level with. When we fall head first with the idea and then get someone to call our own, many people try to create a life/relationship that reflects what they see in movies, celebrities, social media etc., and that can break your relationship. Therefore, don't fall in love with the \"idea,\" of having a wife/husband, boyfriend/girlfriend, best-friend or getting married etc., just because you're trying to fit in or prove something to someone because at the end of the day it can and will bite you where it hurts the most and that is in the heart.\nLike this:\nIt is crazy how we as humans have this ideal and sense of what we want to be in life. We dream, believe, and talk about such thoughts but we don't put our all into it.\nI woke up this morning with confidence, motivation, and drive. Yes, I have these elements every now and then but this was different. My entire being was one. My mind body and soul was working as an unit than just segments. My eyes became wider, my mind became more open, my body became more in tact and my soul became freer and that is when I became a new person as of today. I am 23 and I came to the conclusion that I want to live my life and be who I was meant to be and by being who I was meant to be, that means I have to put my all into everything I do from here on out and I will not say no as an answer. My dreams will become my reality and I can't wait to reach that peak.\n\nQuestion: According to the text, what should people not do when it comes to relationships?

It's a concept which is not actually very well understood by most people. I'm not saying that I am special or somehow brighter because I write about paradigms as if I understand them. But the concept of a paradigm itself, minus the change, is pretty simple: it's essentially the subliminal here and now. that's why people find it hard to really grasp the thing happening around them. They are in the warm waters of the darkened room which constitutes most lives. You don't think of your little toe while you walk unless there is something wrong with it. Once that toe starts pulsing there is a paradigm shift. What was is no more: the walk is no longer pleasurable or at least neutral transportation. I figured this out when the arthritis in my big toes started manifesting as really loud screaming pulsing pain in one tiny spot.

{"text": "\"Using the personal stories of senior college students, a 1-hr difference-education intervention at the beginning of college reduced the social-class achievement gap among first-generation and continuing-generation college students by 63% at the end of their first year and also improved first-generation students' college transition on numerous psychosocial outcomes (e.g., psychological adjustment and academic and social engagement). The intervention provided students with the critical insight that people's different backgrounds matter and that people with backgrounds like theirs can succeed when they use the right kinds of tools and strategies. Because first-generation students tend to experience a particularly difficult transition to college and confront background-specific obstacles that can undermine their opportunity to succeed, this framework for understanding how students' backgrounds matter is especially beneficial to them. Yet, at the same time, given the intervention's clear benefits for continuing-generation students' psychological health and levels of engagement, our results suggest that this difference-education experience holds the potential to ease all students' transition to college\" (p.7).\n\"Educators at leading colleges and universities increasingly identify understanding and navigating sociocultural diversity as a critical 21st-century competency. This study presents an initial blueprint for educating students about difference and equipping them to more effectively participate in higher education. This approach has the potential to not only facilitate students' transition to college but also provide them with the skills to be informed, engaged, and productive citizens in our multicultural world.

{"text": "Ways to Keep the Liver Healthy for a More Healthier and Glowing Skin\nThe\nThe liver has two large sections, called the right and the left lobes. The gallbladder sits under the liver, along with parts of the pancreas and intestines. The liver and these organs work together to digest, absorb, and process food.\nOur livers are responsible for many important functions in our bodies. One of the most vital functions of the liver is the removal of toxins from the body. They act as the filter to our bodies, removing the ammonia created by our colons, as well as alcohol and medicines. In addition to filtering our blood, the liver is the store house for fats, sugars, and minerals, as well as the place that fats are broken down. A diet that is too high in fats or sugars could result in an unhealthy liver, unable to properly filter our blood.\nAmazingly enough, whenever our liver has problems, it also affects our skin. Take for example, Jaundice (yellowish discoloration of the skin). It is caused by high levels of bilirubin in the body. If your liver is not doing its job of breaking down toxins efficiently they must be eliminated from your body by other means – in many cases they come out through your skin. When excessive toxins build up in the deeper layers of the skin this causes inflammation to occur and this can manifest as:\nHyper pigmentation (darkening of the skin) Eczema Dermatitis Aging and wrinkling of the skin Red, itchy rashes on the skin Psoriasis Acne Rosacea\nSome signs of worsening skin problems are a sign of liver dysfunction or a precursor to future liver problems. Check your liver for a more healthy, and glowing skin!\nEating the right kinds of foods and staying away from excessive substances usage such as alcohol, tobacco, white sugar, coffee, and if you are taking maintenance medications, check with your physician about the possible side effects of the medicines you are taking for liver damage. Because their are drugs, through long term use, can cause liver damage.\nFoods that Help the Liver\nHere are some of the foods that help in liver function and detoxification:\n1. Garlic Garlic has the ability to activate liver enzymes that help flush out the toxins from our body. It also has selenium which helps in liver cleansing. Be sure it is crushed garlic, and let it sit for 5 minutes, 10 minutes optimally, because the enzyme alliinase will be formed that further help in the keeping your liver healthy.\n2. Beets and Carrots These 2 vegetables are high in flavonoids and beta-carotene. It helps in overall liver function.\n3. Green Leafy Vegetables This has been proven as a very powerful cleanser in our body. Extremely high in chlorophyll that suck out the toxins in our body to keep us healthy. This will greatly help the liver no to overwork itself in removing the harmful substances in our body.\n4. Grapefruit High in anitoxidants to help the liver's cleansing abilities.\n\nQuestion: How does a high-fat diet affect the liver?

{"text": "NEWS & UPDATES\nSchool's Founding in February 1876 Laid the Foundation for Rochester's Landmark Deaf Community By Antony A. L. McLetchie, Superintendent/CEO, Rochester School for the Deaf\nWhen City of Rochester Mayor George Clarkson held a public meeting on February 3, 1876, with citizens concerned about the formal education of children in the local and regional communities who were deaf and hard of hearing, little did anyone in that room realize what their actions would eventually evolve into.\nAt that meeting were, among others, prominent Rochesterians Gilman H. and Caroline Perkins whose deaf daughter Carolyn was receiving private instruction from Mary Hart Nodine. She was a skilled teacher of the deaf who was brought to Rochester by the Perkins with her fiancé Zenas Freeman Westervelt, a fellow teacher, from Frederick, Maryland. Lessons for young Carolyn were given in the Perkins' home on East Avenue near Alexander Street, in a portion of what is now the Genesee Valley Club.\nShortly after his arrival, Westervelt started to collect names of deaf children in Western and Central New York State who were not in school. At that time one of the most accessible schools for deaf children was New York School for the Deaf (a.k.a. Fanwood) in New York City, where at least five Rochester area children attended. Westervelt believed that Rochester would be a suitable location for a new school for deaf children. This inspired Caroline Perkins to first suggest to her husband that such a school be established.\nGilman Perkins then approached his fellow local business owners and associates as well as City of Rochester government officials in order to promote the idea of a school for deaf children in Rochester. This led to Mayor Clarkson's February 3rd public meeting where all in attendance agreed, in principle, that a school named the \"Western New York Institution for Deaf Mutes\" be created. A board of trustees to govern the school was also formalized that day. The following day, February 4, 1876, the board adopted a Constitution and By-Laws and elected Westervelt as school superintendent to formally establish the school.\nOn May 15, 1876, the new school was placed under control of the State Education Department, supervised by the State Board of Charities. This provided the school with operating funds from the state, while buildings, student and other funds were provided by benevolent individuals, businesses, and organizations in the Greater Rochester area. An existing group of buildings at 70 South St. Paul Street (now South Avenue), at the corner of Court Street, was quickly prepared to welcome the first twenty deaf students and their teachers and support staff.\nThe Western New York Institution for Deaf Mutes opened its doors on October 4, 1876. It quickly outgrew its first location from twenty to eighty-seven students and by September 1878 started to occupy its present campus at 1545 St. Paul Street. In 1920 the schools' name was changed to Rochester School for the Deaf.\n\nQuestion: When was the school placed under the control of the State Education Department? Answer: May 15, 1876\n\nQuestion: Where were the lessons for Carolyn Perkins given? Answer: In the Perkins' home on East Avenue near Alexander Street\n\nQuestion: Who was the mayor of Rochester when the idea of a school for deaf children was first proposed?

{"text": "Come early winter and most Indian markets get flooded with this strange looking, sweet smelling fruit. The heaps of spiky greenish-brown fruit turn soft in a matter of days, forcing fruit sellers to offload them to eager customers at lower and lower prices. Their super sweet taste and soft custardy texture make them very popular, especially among children. More so, because a mouthful of their shiny bullet-shaped black seeds when launched on an unsuspecting enemy, can send them packing in a matter of seconds!\nAs ubiquitous as custard apples (Annona squamosa) are to the Indian subcontinent, these bizarre fruit are actually Mexican in origin. The first custard apples to reach Indian shores were likely to have been brought in by Spanish traders, who had a trade link to Mexico via Manila in the Philippines. In fact, ata and atakka, the Bengali and Malayalam names for the fruits come from Ate, the Mexican name for custard apple. The tropical climates in most parts of India suited them just fine, and now they are a well-established part of the localised flora of India. Known as sharifa and sitaphala around the rest of India, most of the fruit is commercially cultivated in warm, dry areas with well-drained soils. Assam, Bihar, Telengana and Tamil Nadu are the main custard apple growing regions in India, with MP, Maharashtra, Odisha and Rajasthan producing large crops of the fruit as well. Karnataka does not figure very high in custard apple production, though the trees are often cultivated individually in home or farm gardens for personal use.\n\nQuestion: What is the main season when custard apples are available in Indian markets?

{"text": "Steven M. Gillon, a historian for the History Channel, has a purpose in his work that is common in most, if not all, in his line of work. Like most historians, Gillon wishes to convey history as close to actuality as possible. Specifically in his book, Pearl Harbor: FDR Leads the Nation into War, Gillon's purpose is to not only delineate as accurately as possibly, but to tell the story from a personal point of view. Throughout the book, Gillon utilizes a story plot structure. Using a story design, Gillon aims to inform us about not just the Pearl Harbor attack itself, but also on the mentalities of the President, Franklin D. Roosevelt, the political and military advisors, and of the citizens of the United States. Gillon intercepts the personal histories of several key people, mainly FDR and his wife, to facilitate the building of a relationship between the reader and those of the past. By doing so, the audience understands the human side of one of the most significant event of the 20th century, regardless of nationality. Contrary to most other works on Pearl Harbor, Gillon's FDR Leads the Nation into War, pays little attention to the military attack itself. Gillon's purpose in using this approach is to have the audience personally relate to FDR. Gillon gives the reader details about not only the president's official business matters, but also on his personal relationships, including that of him and his wife. Eleanor Roosevelt would, \"brief her husband on what she had witnessed and prod him to action.\" More personal information was given as well. Gillon describes how the Mr. and Mrs. Roosevelt met, \" 'He was young and gay and good looking,' she recalled, 'and I was shy and awkward and thrilled when he asked me to dance.\" The personal back stories are essential in understanding motives for historic decisions and feelings. Gillon's research on the personal backgrounds of those surround the Second World War offers the audience additional key information. This extra information is vital in understanding the motives for several actions taken during the war period and also facilitates the understanding of why certain courses were not taken. The recount into each of the personal lives of the President, First Lady, and the administration serves to truly convey the history of the Pearl Harbor and World War 2 in their entireties, not just partial, select chunks. Gillon desired to show us the \"behind the scenes\" of the 1940's and World War 2.\n\nQuestion: In contrast to other works on Pearl Harbor, what does Gillon's book pay little attention to?

{"text": "Most of your post has been addressed by past articles, but going back to read through it all is a lot of work. Most of what you're saying is \"Success in the story is guaranteed, so player's choices don't matter. They will make it to the end of the plot (or keep adventuring ad nauseam if it's more of a 'sandbox').\" And that's a valid way to play the game. For others, if the GM were to refuse to let the party fail, that would be seen as cheap and unsatisfying. They instead want to play the game where \"Success is unsure. If the players choose poorly, their characters can fail at their missions or even die.\" This is also a valid way to play.\nIf a game is based on challenge, then it's absolutely fine for the adventure to hinge on a few or even a single die roll. In a climactic battle, a loss may come down to that one missed smite or something similar, and that's okay. The secret door in your example IS a poor use of a failure state, but not because it's a single die roll. The reason is that the player's have no choices to make. And that's anathema to a true Role Playing Game, because making choices is the core mechanic!\nFailure is not a 'story impediment'. It's simply another event in the story. Sometimes it's the last event in the story, and that just means the story has ended. Maybe the magic elf horse river doesn't stop the ringwraiths and they come and coup de grace Frodo. The story ends in chapter 2. It may not be satisfying, but that adventure has come to an end. Sure, now you can have a new game where the denizens of Middle Earth desperately try to hold off the armies of Sauron, and you have a climactic last stand at Helm's Deep, but Aragorn misses his finishing blow against Sauron and dies. Now all good on Middle Earth is wiped out. And now the second story ends. There are no more stories to be told in Middle Earth, and that's okay. The story ended!\nPerhaps as I read more of Angry, I'll figure out how to keep my mini-rants coherent. We'll see.\nPlayers have a limited tolerance for game ending failure. In a sense failure is a currency you use to buy suspense or realism. You build up your account by running good games and write a check each time failure brings things to a screeching halt. Thus it is a terrible idea to allow yourself to get hacked into a corner where you have to write that check early on before you have anything in that account to spend. Sure, some people are more forgiving, but others are not.\nA lot of this changes depending on group dynamics and the game in question. Some games have super simple creation and recognize character attrition as a game element. Those games can allow for more failure because the proverbial check being written is very small. On the other hand, some systems or games take hours to generate characters (or the GM has asked for extra investment), thus the size of the check is enormous.\n\nQuestion: Is it true that in some games, success is guaranteed and player choices don't matter?

{"text": "Essential Requisites to Perfect a Contract\nEssential Requisites to Perfect a Contract\nIn general, a contract is perfected only when all of the following requisites are present: (1) consent of the contracting parties; (2) object certain which is the subject matter of the contract; and (3) cause of the obligation which is established.\nConsent is manifested by the meeting of the offer and the acceptance upon the thing and the cause which are to constitute the contract. The offer must be certain and the acceptance must be absolute. If a party offers a qualified acceptance, the same is considered a counter-offer.\nAn acceptance of an offer may either be express or implied. In case an acceptance is made via a letter or telegram by a party, the contract is only perfected once the offeror learns of the acceptance. In this case, there arises a presumption that the contract has been entered into in the place where the offer was made.\nThe party making an offer may fix the time, place, and manner of acceptance, all of which are required to be complied. If the offer was coursed through an agent, the other party may manifest his acceptance to the agent binding the principal. The offer becomes ineffective upon the death, civil interdiction, insanity, or insolvency of either party before acceptance is conveyed.\nIf the offer carries with it a certain period to accept, the party making an offer may still withdraw at any time before acceptance of the other by informing the latter. This right to withdraw is not available when the option is founded upon a consideration, as something paid or promised.\nThe following cannot give consent to a contract: (a) minors; (b) insane or demented persons; and (c) deaf-mutes who do not know how to write. Even if a party is insane or demented, he may still validly enter into a contract during a lucid interval. Contracts agreed into in a state of drunkenness or during a hypnotic spell are voidable.\nFor goods, an object of a contract includes all things which are not outside the commerce of men, including future things and transmissible rights. For services, an object of a contract includes all services which are not contrary to law, morals, good customs, public order, or public policy may likewise be the object of a contract.\nThe object of a contract is required to be determinate as to its kind. If it involves an indeterminate quantity, the contract remains valid so long as it is possible to determine the same, without the need of a new contract between the parties. Future inheritance cannot be an object of a contract, unless otherwise expressly authorized by law. However, impossible things or services cannot be the object of contracts.\nIn onerous contracts, the cause is the prestation or promise of a thing or service by the other. For remuneratory ones, the cause is the service or benefit which is remunerated. In gratuitous contracts, the cause is the mere liberality of the benefactor.\nBest Legal Practices:\n\nQuestion: Can a contract have an indeterminate quantity as its object?

{"text": "WeWhat do you think of when you hear the word \"Adoption?\" Where do we get our information about adoption from? Some people hear about adoption from the media & movies. However, you must ask yourself if that is a true and accurate representation of what adoption is like today. ​ Adoption has been around for a very long time dating all the way back to the days of the Bible. The first story in the Bible about adoption was with Moses. If you need a refresher about his life, check out the story in Exodus 2.\nIn adoption, unfortunately the history includes shame and secrecy. Openness can be an \"antidote to shame.\" Moving along the time periods, closed adoptions stayed the norm for many years. In the early 1930s, it was believed that adoption should be a \"discreet process and that secrecy should be maintained to protect not just the adoptive family, but also the birth parents.\" However, in the 1980s, people realized that this secrecy, guilt and shame lead to resentment and depression. In closed adoptions, the adoptive families were unable to even access their adoption records or resources to help them. The child had no sense of where they came from and the women who made an adoption plan lived hiding their adoption story. As a result, adoption is very different today. ​ Today, most agencies conduct open to semi-open adoptions, with closed adoptions still being an option for birthparent(s) if they so choose. First off, openness in adoption means maintaining some degree of contact between the adopted child, their birth families, and the adoptive family. There are different forms that openness can take in regard to the type of contact, frequency, intensity/emotional impact, time and location. The openness continuum can range between the exchanging of non-identifying information through a third party, to arrangements for face-to-face contact and many types of openness in between. For more information about open, semi-open and closed adoptions please visit our Types of Adoption Openness page. At Christian Family Life Services, most of our families choose a semi-open adoption plan where non-identifying information is shared through letters and pictures. In addition, occasional face-to-face visits take place at a neutral location.\nBirth mother in semi-open relationship - received quilt with son's baby clothes after his first birthday.\n*We encourage families who are considering adoption to take time to research stories of openness and talk together with your spouse about your personal comfort level regarding your relationship with birth parents. Transparency is important in this process, and the CFLS case work will provide more education and tools as couples walk through the home study process.\n​In celebration of Adoption Awareness Month in November, Christian Family Life Services wants to showcase our beautiful families whom have adopted through us. Families built through adoption may not share genes, but they certainly share lots of love!

{"text": "Thursday, April 7, 2011\nWhy I am prochoice and unsympathetic\nYes, friends, there really is a reason.\nRoe vs Wade passed when I was barely a teenager, not even dating. I had a beautiful, both inside and out, cousin. Unfortunately, diabetis runs in my family and her mother had it. During her pregnancy for her third little girl, she became diabetic. It did not go away after the birth.\nBirth control pills were not available back then and in the testing stage. No matter how hard she and her husband had tried, she became pregnant for the fourth time a few of years later. The doctor gave her a choice, terminate the pregnancy or face going blind. There was no either or invovled. If she continued with the pregnancy, she would go blind and she had a husband and 3 little girls to raise in a time before all the nice advances blind people enjoy today.\nNeither her husband's minister or her mother's had any problem with her having an abortion, so after a lot of soul searching, she made an appointment. Because of the diabetis, she needed a precheck up. During the precheckup, these nut cases got her license plate at the clinic and also followed her home.\nThe next day they descended upon her home and she follishly let them into her house because of one fact we didn't know at the time: she was legally blind and had no idea who she was letting in the house. Two days later, her husband came home unexpectedly and found her hysterical. He then answered the phone and these nut cases were on the phone screaming \"Murderer, you are going to kill your child!\". There was no reasoning with them. Abortion is murder even if it means the mother must die. By the end of the week, he had to have the phone turned off because no matter how many times they changed the number and unlisted it, they found it. They camped on the lawn until the snow came a week later.\nThat was the week we came to visit. I was just 12 years old and I came very close to killing one of these \"church ladies\" when a cop intervened. He asked me an odd question: did my cousin drive us to the pharmacy. I answered yes and when we came out, he drove us home. That was when my mother, her aunt and who she was named after, got the whole story (or so we thought) out of her.\nAs long as we were there, the problems were taken care of but unfortunately we couldn't stay long and they successfully bullied her into not having the abortion. She was completely blind by the end of the month. She was dead by the end of the next month with the baby she was carrying because she forgot to mention that aside from going blind for certain, there was an 80% chance she could not survive carrying the baby to term and a 70% chance the baby would die.\n\nQuestion: What was the author's age when these events took place?

{"text": "i) What is the far infrared luminosity density of the local Universe and how does this density compare to that produced at other wavelengths? To answer this question we first need to construct luminosity functions (Fig. 7) [58]. Integration of the luminosity function over flux density gives the total flux density per unit volume in the Universe. The first far infrared luminosity functions were produced from IRAS observations (λ≤100μm) [59] - this has essentially remained the state-of-the-art until the advent of Herschel. The reason for this is that neither ISO or Spitzer observed the large numbers of complete samples of galaxies that IRAS did or surveyed large areas like Herschel and Planck have done. In addition Herschel/Planck observations at wavelengths 200μm<λ<1382μm are effectively unique and sample the region where the majority of the dust is radiating. Our selection from WISE provides a stellar mass selected sample for which we will have measured and predicted Herschel/Planck observations at wavelengths from 70-1382μm. We can measure for the first time the local (within 3000 km s-1) total far-infrared luminosity density of the Universe due to cosmic dust in galaxies. This value can be compared directly with the luminosity density emitted by stars taken from our SED and radiative transfer models. This will directly provide a 'global' value for the fraction of radiation absorbed by dust and a 'typical' optical depth for stellar photons.\nFig 7. Far infrared luminosity functions for Virgo cluster galaxies. The red dot-dashed line is that measured by IRAS at 100μm for galaxies in all environments [59]. Will the luminosity functions measured over the local volume correspond better with that measured by IRAS?\nii) What is the cosmic dust mass density of the local Universe and how does this density compare with the density of gas and stars? The dust mass function is the function that fits the observations of the numbers of galaxies per unit volume in each interval of dust mass. Integrating this function over mass gives the total dust mass in galaxies per unit volume in the local Universe. Values for the dust mass density over much larger distance scales have previously been done in a statistical way (photometric redshifts) [60], but never in the definitive way we are proposing here and not to the low galactic dust masses that we can achieve. The derived dust mass density can be compared with observations of the stars and gas in these galaxies to give for the first time global dust-to-gas and dust-to-stars ratios for the local Universe. As stated in the introduction the stellar, gas and metals mass fractions are linked through a chemical evolution model of galaxies. We can for the first time apply a chemical evolution model like this to both local galaxies and the local volume as a whole and make inferences about, for example, how much gas and/or metals have been lost by galaxies to the local inter-galactic medium. Our local dust mass density can also be compared with values derived by the cosmological surveys that look at unresolved galaxies at large distances over relatively small areas of sky.\n\nQuestion: What are the dust-to-gas and dust-to-stars ratios that the authors aim to calculate for the first time? Answer: Global dust-to-gas and dust-to-stars ratios for the local Universe.\n\nQuestion: What can the comparison of the local dust mass density with values derived from cosmological surveys provide? Answer: Insights into the amount of gas and/or metals lost by galaxies to the local inter-galactic medium.\n\nQuestion: What is the purpose of integrating the dust mass function over mass?

{"text": "Menu\nArchives\nAs today's classrooms become increasingly more diverse, teachers must strategically plan instruction that complements the learning needs of these students. Teachers must differentiate their instruction to ensure that every student has access to learning. Teachers' expectations must be high for all students including those who are struggling with language or disabilities. Moreover, accommodations must also be made for those students that need to be challenged with enriching activities and projects.\nDifferentiating instruction can be time-consuming and laborious. It is understandable that it is sometimes difficult and even frustrating to plan activities for the diverse student populations in the classroom. However, there are many resources on the web today that provide easy access to strategies and tools for facilitating differentiation.

These wonderful resources can facilitate the planning of differentiated learning activities for ELLs and students with disabilities. All teachers need to do is create an account:\nNews Ela– is a wonderful website that provides access to high interest, standards based, thought-provoking nonfiction articles that can be accessed at five different levels. Students are able to annotate the articles and respond to critical thinking questions in writing. Using such a website allows students to read about the same topic but with different levels of difficulty. This way students are not frustrated but rather motivated to contribute to the discussion.\nRead Works– is another wonderful website that provides access to high interest fiction and nonfiction articles organized by Lexile levels for grades K to 12. Every article also comes with high-order questions to assess comprehension. The site is especially useful for ELLs as it promotes vocabulary development.\nLearn Zillion– is a fabulous website that provides 3-5 minute video lessons in literacy and math, downloadable slides, and other resources for practice. All lessons and other resources are easy to follow and aligned to the Common Core Standards. Teachers can utilize the clips to help students practice a skill, to understand a challenging concept, and to develop interest as the interactive video clips are engaging and complement the needs of visual learners.\nDare to Differentiate Wiki– is a great Wiki with a plethora of already made differentiated activities and resources for teachers to access and use with their struggling students as well as with students that need to be challenged.\nThe Learning Leader– this is a link to a page on a Wiki I created which provides more resources for differentiating lessons.\nWeb 2.0: Cool Tools For Schools – this site provides an extensive compilation of online resources and devices for differentiating learning using technology.\nReading Comprehension and Fluency for ELLs– this is a page on Colorin Colorado, an excellent website with a plethora of resources especially for ELLs. This pages provides great ideas for differentiating literacy instruction for English language learners.\nShare My Lesson – this website provides many lessons with differentiated ideas and strategies for grades k to 5. Search by grade and curricular area.\nThis post on Edutopia provides many more tools for differentiating instruction using social media.\nIncluding Choice:\n\nQuestion: What is the name of the website that offers an extensive compilation of online resources and devices for differentiating learning using technology?

From this creel yarn passes through tension and spacing devices and through a leasing reed which separates the yarn threads and keeps them in the correct order before being wound onto a warping balloon.Selvedge means the edge of a fabric that is woven so that it will not ravel or fray.\nfabricweaving\nWavy twills are also known as pointed twills. In these classes of twill weaves the twill progresses in one direction for half of the repeat and then is reversed for the next half of the repeat. The reversal of the twill may be done in a regular or irregular manner primarily considering the series of threads that predominate the face of the fabric. Thus warp way reversal is where the warp predominates over the weft and weft way reversal where the weft predominates over the warp.\nfabricweaving\nThese twills are obtained by arrangement of a continuous twill either warp way or weft way. There arrangement is normally done in a particular order or sequence. Rearranged twills are of two types Satin/sateen weaves and Corkscrew weavesapparelfabricweaving\nCombination twills find extensive use in the worsted industry in the production of garment fabrics, as these weaves are capable of producing compact textures. These twills are constructed by two methods 1. End and end combination 2.Pick and pick combination. In the first method the twill weaves are combined end way and in the second method twill weaves are combined in pick way. In combination with twill weaves two different types of continuous twills are combined together alternately.\nfabrichosieryweaving\nWeaving is the process of making fabrics by interlacing the threads lengthwise and width wise commonly known as warp and weft in a regular order. The operation is performed in a machine called a loom. Two sets of yarns are interlaced, almost always at right angles to each other. One, called the warp, runs lengthwise in the loom; the other, called the filling, weft or woof, runs crosswise. The raising and lowering sequence of warp threads in various sequences gives many possible weave structures.\n\nQuestion: In combination twills, what are the two methods used to combine twill weaves?

{"text": "And finally, the UN reform remains an important agenda at the international level. Since its inception in 1945, the UN has exercised a key role in promoting a safer and more secure world, improving the lives of citizens worldwide, and safeguarding and promoting human fights. Nevertheless, in view of our ever-changing world, we cannot negate the fact that this organization is in dire need of a comprehensive reform, enabling it to better reflect the new challenges and realities of our time. The reform of the UN Security Council is an issue long overdue. Achieving a reformed Council that is more inclusive, representative and transparent must remain a priority; and we welcome the ongoing progress within the framework of the inter-governmental negotiations (IGN).\nThank you.\n—\nSwitzerland:Statement by Eveline Widmer-Schlumpf at 67th UN General Assembly\nMr. President of the General Assembly,\nHeads of State and Government,\nMr. Secretary-General,\nExcellencies,\nLadies and gentlemen,\n10 years of Switzerland in the UN\nIt was exactly ten years ago that Switzerland joined the UN as the one hundred and ninetieth member state. And it was the first country in which UN membership was approved by the citizens in a popular vote. The UN and Switzerland share the same values and pursue the same goals: the promotion of peace and security, sustainable development, the protection and promotion of human rights and the provision of emergency relief to victims of conflict and natural disasters.\nWe face significant and pressing challenges in all these areas. Climate change, food security, water scarcity, migration, organised crime, terrorism and the proliferation of weapons do not halt at our borders. These are global challenges, which threaten entire regions. In an increasingly interconnected world, we have to search for global solutions; global solutions which enjoy regional and national support. It is not enough to simply maintain the status quo. We have to find solutions today for the challenges we will face tomorrow.\nFor a strong, modern and efficient UN\nThe UN has worldwide membership. This gives it unparalleled legitimacy and places it in a unique position to find and implement solutions to global challenges, solutions which therefore enjoy broad support. In view of the growing interdependence between these challenges, we need the UN now more than ever. It must take its place at the heart of international governance. But each and every member state is called upon to play its part. If we are to master these herculean tasks, it is not enough to settle for the lowest common denominator – as is all too often the case when consensus is reached at the UN.\nIn order for the UN to overcome these challenges, it must be efficient, innovative and capable of taking action. What does that mean?\nThe UN can be efficient if it updates and optimises its processes so that it can act more rapidly and in a more coordinated manner, despite growing budgetary pressures. Switzerland supports the reform agenda of the UN Secretary-General. This should be implemented swiftly.\n\nQuestion: When was Switzerland's first UN membership approved by its citizens? Answer: Exactly ten years ago from the statement.\n\nQuestion: Which UN reform agenda does Switzerland support? Answer: The UN Secretary-General's reform agenda.", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "d2c5ed05-4f9a-48b9-90e8-9b4ddac7554c", "url": "https://jonkirby2012.wordpress.com/2012/09/"}

The american flag stands for the soldiers that fight for us everyday and risk their lives for us. I think its good to say the pledge everyday. Its the least we could do for them. When soldiers die a huge american flag covers their casket then the family gets it because they protected us. I'm glad we have the American flag because thats what symbols our country. Other countries have their own flags too. I think ours is the best though. When I look at the flag I also think of the 50 states in the US because there are 50 stars on the flags for the 50 states.

Veterans of the wars seem to have more flags then anyone. In the southern states of America, people usually have a rebel flag and an American flag all at once. In the Northern states, it is only the American flag. I guess people still believe in the south's 'old ways'. My house does not have any type of flags in the yard. I don't really know anyone who actually has a big flag pole. Every school in America has a flag outside. Every church usualy does also. Even some stores. Restaurants never really have them.

{"text": "sanskrit is never the laguage of \"bread people\". there is a strong arguement that the laguage used by sindhu valley civilization was infact an early version of sanskrit.(this civilisation, as even supporters of aryan invation theory agree, was of indian origin)\nif those dravidians had a laguage before bread people invaded, where is it now? in no epic or stories ofpresent day \"dravidian languages\" we come across the days before invasion. and all of them evolved after sanskrit and borrowed heavily from it.\nKuffir: No doubt I think that there were lots of invasions and other interaction each way. Probably most had no lasting impact (except maybe some hard feelings).\nAbhinav: Indeed you have seen through me. Clearly it is hypocrisy for me, a blogger, to urge others to not waste time. Time wasting is one of the great joys in life. I just liked the comment in Sepia Mutiny and wanted to spread it a little.\nAnon1: Alexander was a madcap. His only virtue was that he made reading history somewhat entertaining. But what could he have been thinking. Him and Genghis and Napoleon - what madcaps. If they had been satisfied to conquer a small area that they could control for centuries they might have had some lasting impact, but instead they conquered \"the world\" and their empires quickly vanished.\nAnon2: Indeed Sanskrit was some artificial language for royal poets much like high Latin. The \"vulgar Sanskrit\" that was brought by the bread people probably is unique to India. But the root of the language stretches back all the way to Anatolia.\nAnon3: Indeed perhaps people in India had no language before the bread people came. Perhaps they just pointed and grunted. This could be an alternative explanation for the spread of language as opposed to the invasion theory. But this still begs the question of where Tamil came from.\nThe Vedic form of Sanskrit is an early descendant of Proto-Indo-Iranian (spoken around 2000 BC), and still comparatively similar (being removed by maybe 1500 years) to the Proto-Indo-European language. Vedic Sanskrit is the oldest attested language of the Indo-Iranian branch of the Indo-European family. It is also still closely related to Avestan, the oldest preserved Iranian language.\nAryan Invasion Theory is a misnomer... It's hard to refute the fact that there is no single Indian Race, or an Indian family of languages so to speak. But one cannot imply that the heterogeneity is because of an Invasion by a 'fair-skinned' race exactly 5000 years ago. A more plausible version of history would suggest the gradual migration of central asian tribes to India.... The first such migration probably occured 5000 years ago...And there have been many such incursions since then.\nBut one thing is for sure...The caste system was, in its origins, an attempt at racial segregation.\n\nQuestion: What is the relationship between Vedic Sanskrit and Proto-Indo-European language? Answer: Vedic Sanskrit is an early descendant of Proto-Indo-Iranian and still similar to Proto-Indo-European.\n\nQuestion: Did the Dravidian languages exist before the supposed Aryan invasion? Answer: There is no evidence of them existing before the invasion.\n\nQuestion: What was the original purpose of the caste system?

{"text": "Pagini\nSunday, July 3, 2016\nThe largest bears that ever walked the Earth\nThe work of University of Adelaide researchers is shedding new light on the evolution of what are believed to be the largest bears that ever walked the Earth.\nDr Kieren Mitchell, from the University's Australian Centre for Ancient DNA, School of Biological Sciences, has a new paper just published in Biology Letters.\nHe writes: \"During the Pleistocene (2.5 million years ago -- 11 thousand years ago) giant bears weighing over 1,000kg roamed both North and South America. These giants belonged to a now practically extinct subfamily of bears -- Tremarctinae -- which is today only represented by the small, herbivorous Andean spectacled bear (Tremarctos ornatus).\nAdăugați o legendă\n\"The giant North American bears (Arctodus) and South American bears (Arctotherium) have long been believed to be each others' closest relative. However, by comparing ancient DNA data obtained from representatives of the two extinct genera and comparing them with the living species, we were able to show that Arctotherium is most closely related to Tremarctos and not Arctodus.\n\"The implication of this result is that these bears represent a remarkable instance of convergent evolution, as giant bears appear to have evolved independently in both North and South America.\n\"This convergent evolution would have arisen in response to similar environmental conditions on both continents, most likely an abundance of large herbivore carcasses (killed by smaller predators), which Arctodus and Arctotherium could effectively dominate, and a lack of competing scavengers.\"\nStory Source:\nThe above post is reprinted from materials provided by University of Adelaide\n\nQuestion: Which continents did these giant bears inhabit?

{"text": "A Retrospective: Insuring the Future of the Environment (and Many Businesses)\nBy Matt O'Malley, President, XL Catlin- Environmental\n3/23/2016\nWhile it may seem hard to believe today, prior to the 1970s, little was known about the potential effects industry and waste mismanagement could have on the environment. Science had not quite caught up to understand the ramifications of hazardous waste and what it could do to the natural environmental or what threats it posed to human health. It was a problem that many just chose to bury, literally. That was until Love Canal, one of the US' biggest environmental disasters, brought everyone back to reality.\nLove Canal began in the late 1800s when entrepreneur William T. Love planned to build a seven-mile long canal that would connect the upper and lower levels of the Niagara River and provide hydroelectric power. He envisioned a city growing up around the power plant that would attract industry but financial difficulties snuffed out his dream, leaving a one-mile long open trench. His commercial vision of the area did come true. It became a major center for the chemical, electrochemical, abrasive and graphite industries. Various industries and the City of Niagara Falls used Love's open trench to dispose of waste materials thru the 1940s.Estimates put the amount of chemical waste dumped in the canal during its life at 20,000 metric tons.\nThe dump site was deeded to the Niagara Falls Board of Education in 1953 under a city order for Hooker Chemical to sell the land for $1. Hooker warned the city of the possible dangers of building on the site, but the city threatened Hooker with eminent domain proceedings. Subsequently the city built a school and a park atop the fill area and soon many homes surrounded the old dump site. Throughout the 1950s, complaints of eye and respiratory tract irritation were common. Some children even received chemical burns while playing at the school's playground.\nThe Problem Bubbled Up\nThe extent of the Love Canal problem did not become obvious until the mid-1970s. Heavy precipitation caused the site to become saturated with water and the once buried chemicals began to ooze l from under the soil cap. The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) was called in to perform studies and found carcinogenic chemicals in basements and homes surrounding the school. In 1978, President Jimmy Carter declared the canal and surrounding homes a disaster area.\nThere was much litigation and dispute over who was responsible for the costs of cleanup and compensation to the victims of Love Canal. The cleanup costs for Love Canal have been staggering, exceeding $100 million. Eventually a settlement was reached between 1,345 residents of the Love Canal area. However, some 1,000 plaintiffs are involved in new, ongoing Love Canal litigation today.\nAnd the cleanup of Love Canal continues to this day. Just recently, the New York Department of Environmental Conservation fenced off the historic landfill and NY State Senator Robert Ortt is calling for an environmental study and a cleanup plan.\nThe Need Grew\n\nQuestion: What was the estimated amount of chemical waste dumped in the canal during its life? Answer: 20,000 metric tons\n\nQuestion: How many residents were part of the settlement reached in the Love Canal litigation?

{"text": "Brace yourselves folks: your grey matter and perception of time is about to get seriously twisted. Again.\nNew Nintendo has a fuller translation of the Legend of Zelda timeline we posted the other day. This has been translated from the Hyrule Historia art book, but as usual remember it's a fan translation so don't take it as 100% gospel just yet.\nDoes this description clear some things up, or is it still a bit of a fuzzy mess?\nBranch 1: Link is defeated by Ganon in OoT. Branch 2: Link comes back from the future in OoT and tells Zelda what's going to happen, she sends him away. Branch 3: There is no longer a hero in the future of OoT since Link was sent back.\nAfter Link dies in Ocarina of Time, Ganon obtains the entire Triforce. The Seven Sages seal away Ganon and the whole Triforce as a last resort, but villains with their eyes on the Triforce make for the Sacred Realm, which eventually turns into the Dark World and is filled with evil power. The Seven Sages then try to seal away the Sacred Realm itself, but end up fighting with monsters. This is the Imprisoning War of A Link to the Past.\nwhen OOT's Link first pulls out the Master Sword and goes into the future, he actually travels to an alternate future universe, disapearing from his original universe forever. This \"original universe\" timeline continues on witout OOT's Link to defeat Ganon, who is instead trapped by the seven sages, setting up the events of Link to the Past.\nAlso why that is wrong is because he didn't travel in time the first time. He was put to sleep for 7 years. If he did disappear the Master Sword would have gone with him (but it exists in Link to the Past). LttP's back story was that (at the time) there was no hero worthy of using the Master Sword. A lot of the knights died in battle against Ganon. Link was one of them.\nThis means Link would have had to pull the Master Sword first so Ganondorf would even be able to get the Triforce. So it was the future Link that failed. Ganon received the WHOLE Triforce in that game. Having killed Link he took his piece then went for Zelda's.\nI also want to add. The Master Sword didn't cause the split. The Gate of Time and Master Sword were both designed so you could time travel freely back and forth. Things you do in the past changed the present.\nIt was when Zelda sent Link back with the Ocarina that caused the split. So Link dying is an alternate outcome not really a split but comes from the Adult ending.\nSo Link kills Ganondorf and this leads to Majora's Mask and TP then ultimately Four Swords adventures (that makes sense)...but Spirit Tracks is ultimately the result of....what? lol Is it Link going back in time before beating Ganondorf in OoT? Or is that what leads to Adventure of Link?\n\nQuestion: Which game's events lead to Spirit Tracks?

It suggests he is put to sleep for 7 years.\n\nQuestion: What is the name of the art book from which this timeline was translated?

{"text": "The Day Moses Broke All Ten Commandments\nI'm not sure if we admit it as much as we used to, but we all sin pretty regularly.\nFor those who recognize the authority of Scripture, sin is defined by two words: transgression & iniquity. Transgression is the crossing of a line, the outward act of sin. Iniquity is the inner motivation, our fleshly bent toward sin. (The good news is that Jesus was both wounded for our transgressions and bruised for our iniquity!)\nEven if a person refuses to accept God's word as the standard of right and wrong, there is still a \"sin\" issue. When he/she chooses to do something that, in their own mind, they believe they shouldn't do, that action is transgressing their own sense of morality. By their own conscience they have done wrong.\nThe point is, we sin.\nOne day God met with Moses on Mt. Sinai and wrote (literally with His finger) ten commandments into stone tablets. Moses carried these tablets down the mountain to present them to the people; however, the people of Israel were dancing with another god – one they had made.\nOutraged at the people's hardened hearts, Moses threw the tablets to the ground, breaking all Ten Commandments in one day! Haha. But, seriously, Moses was visually demonstrating what had actually happened. The commandments were indeed broken.\nI hate sinning. But I still do. I say the wrong things, think the wrong things, and do the wrong things.\nWe all do.\nAnd we know it.\nSo, what does God think about you when you sin? Look how He responded to Moses:\n\".\"\" Exodus‬ ‭34:6-7‬ ‭ESV‬‬\nTo penitent sinners He is a God of mercy. To rebellious sinners He is a God of judgment.\nThe fact is you sin. The question is, are you honestly acknowleging your need for God's mercy?\nI recently heard this statement: \"When you sin you don't fall from grace, you fall into it.\"\nToday you can come to God without fear. He is merciful and gracious. Not only will He forgive you, He will set you free.\n\nQuestion: What does transgression represent? Answer: The outward act of sin.\n\nQuestion: How does God respond to penitent sinners? Answer: He is a God of mercy.\n\nQuestion: What did Jesus do for our transgressions and iniquity?

The outstanding size of leedishthys problematicus thus implies that there was a massive surge in the plankton population of that Mesozoic oceans.\nWednesday, September 25, 2013\nSince its beginning in 2004, 'Facebook' has made it as an giant success story, albeit not one without controversy. Plenty of controversy. But I am not here to discuss that. I am here to tell you a bit about social networking and why it's a great addition to any Smart TV.\nIn some ways coming out through the now elapsed 'Myspace' and the excess of imitators it left in its wake, Facebook emerged as champion of the social networks, (until the next one comes along, that is). Facebook has occupied the Web using a clever exploitation of these 3 ever-reliable concepts:\n1) People love gossiping about others, particularly secretly.\n2) People are inordinately fond of and poking their noses into the lives of others.\nFacebook is a remarkable tool and one which has easily tailored itself to smart phones, portable devices and now, even Television. In the end, Myspace was the cumbersome Neanderthal, who, even though being better, smarter and more powerful than Homo Sapiens, succumbed to the retreating ice age somewhat swiftly, failing to adapt to the world he could no longer understand. Facebook, conversely, was the eventual Cro Magnon victor, shivering in the cave throughout Neanderthal's time, he emerged on the warm plains of the modern-day and, either directly or indirectly, eradicated his rival before moving with the altering technology and times, to the point he could sit at his writing table and update his position numerous times a day.\n'Twitter' is an extremely limited website that acts like a miniature Facebook. Users have a couple of words to publicize their actions, opinion and/or feelings to a world that mostly does not care unless its worried that it is being cheated on. Yet, while famous people on Facebook tend to not update their own web pages, on Twitter an individual can follow (and sometimes communicate with) the behavior of Hollywood luminaries, celebrities, sports stars and other notable people, who are often surprisingly honest about their daily lives.\nFacebook and Twitter are both big ones, but there's others, greater than I can count that follow the same simple model but specialise in a new area (LinkedIn, for instance, deals with business relationships a lot more than personal ones). Many sites co-exist with Facebook now, feeding off their scraps like remoras on the back of the Tiger Shark.

{"text": "Category: Buddhism\nThai amulets are famous throughout the world. Many Thais make a living selling amulets at the small markets in Bangkok and inside popular temples where private amulet sellers are sometimes allowed to sell their amulets. Temples have amulets made by monks on the premises, or order them from Bangkok artisans. Thai amulet styles are virtually unlimited and it would be safe to say there are many thousands of styles available.\nThailand is full of amulets of all sorts, shapes, sizes, and for many purposes. Thai amulets are generally worn for purposes of protection, good health, long-life, business prosperity, and gaining favor among people and gods.\nThe main figures used in Thai amulets are:\nBuddha\nGanesha (Ganesh) – the Hindu elephant God of obstacles. Ganesh is said to place and remove obstacles that help the person develop spiritually. Ganesha is the son of Shiva and Parvati. Hindu people pray to Ganesha before they do anything – so that there will be no obstacles in their path.\nQuan Yin (Gwan Yin, Kwan Yin) – Goddess of compassion.\nLuang Por Tuad – a famous Thai monk that was renowned for having mystical powers. He turned saltwater to drinking water by making a circle in the sea with his foot for instance.\nNong Kwak – Buddha is seated and with right hand is waving – in Thai a wave vertically means to come here… in this case, the Buddha is calling customers in – and so this is a business prosperity amulet.\nPra Bit Tar – closed eyes monk. Usually seated in lotus or half-lotus meditative position with his hands over his eyes.\nLuang Por Jumnien – Thailand's good luck monk in the south.\nThe Jatukum craze of a few years ago has died down and many Jatukum amulets were being dumped into streams in heaps as worthless junk because temples made thousands of them and they couldn't sell them. The problem with the Jatukum craze was that many temples jumped in and made their own amulets – buying the heavy metal presses and paying craftsmen to create dies that would shape the clay into the various Jatukum amulets. The market flooded fast and within 3 years the craze was over. Temples still have these amulets on display but many Thais either refuse to wear Jatukam amulets, or prefer others.\nCircular clay Thai amulets about 1cm thick, and 10 cm in diameter – though there are smaller and larger ones. Though Jatukam amulets are made primarily of clay they mix other substances with the clay to effect various powers and strength: hair, skin, ashes from a cremation, different colored soil, plants, jewels, glass, plastic beads, skull fragments, bone, and teeth fragments from humans and animals, and various metals including gold, silver, brass, copper, tin, bronze, and pewter.\nThis Thai amulet was made from the dirt of 7 different Thai graveyards.\n\nQuestion: What is the purpose of the Nong Kwak amulet?

{"text": "According to the \"Enlightenment\"/American doctrine of sovereignty of the people, we the people, the voters, (supposedly) delegate to those elected the specific authority and power to make laws and govern. Yet, how can someone (you, me, the average citizen) who does not have the authority/power to make laws ourselves delegate to someone else (by voting them in office) the authority/power to make laws? How can we give to them an authority/power (viz. legislating laws binding on the nation) that we do not have in the first place? It is a self-delusion. Sadly, the vast majority of citizens do not recognize this intrinsic self-contradiction and deception.\nSince this entire concept may be new to most readers, let us examine this further.\nIf you elect someone to represent you in the legislative body, and thus (supposedly) gave him the power and authority to make and pass laws binding on the rest, whereby you as a non-legislator cannot make laws binding on others, then how can you give out such power/authority to another to make laws, when you yourself cannot make binding laws yourself, because you do not have the authority to do it? You are, therefore, giving out (delegating) what you in fact do not possess -the authority and power to legislate binding laws. It is intrinsically self-defeating.\nOne might retort: This sovereignty/authority does not reside in any one individual, it resides collectively in the people. I answer, but the process occurs by individual acts (viz. voting) and thus cannot be divorced from the individual, for the collective is nothing without actual individuals, and is entirely dependent upon them.\nLet's look at it another way. If a legislator has received his power to make laws from those who voted him in office, then, if/when he does legislate certain laws that many may not like, they can disregard them since the legislator (according to our system) received his authority and power to pass such laws from them (the voters) in the first place. It is an endless circle of everyone having power and authority and NO ONE having power and authority. It is a clever trick from the Master of Deception –Satan. True and informed Christians answer as Christ answered: \"Thou would not have any power over me, unless it were given thee from above\" (Jn.19:11).\nPope Pius XI, in his encyclical Quas Primas (1928) on the Kingship of Christ, declared:\nWith God and Jesus Christ excluded.\n\nQuestion: What did Pope Pius XI declare in his encyclical Quas Primas? Answer: He declared that with God and Jesus Christ excluded.\n\nQuestion: Who does the text suggest is the source of authority for legislators? Answer: The text suggests that the authority comes from above, as per Jesus Christ's response in John 19:11.\n\nQuestion: What is the text's view on the idea that legislators' power comes from voters?

{"text": "interest of managers are to manage the earnings of the firm. They solely want\nto manage the earnings and to protect the corporations from heavy taxes. (Vivien Beatte, 1994), came up with the\nidea that managers manage the earnings basically by utilizing the term in\nIncome statement that is Extraordinary Items. Normally the details about items\nthese are given in the Financial Statements. But by external auditors no such\ndetailed investigation is carried out if any part of office or some items or\nsome data is burnt, as recovering those things is difficult. In order to avoid\nheavy taxes, some of the losses which might be artificially created or are not\nas big as mentioned, are written in the financial statements. This helps the\nmanagers not only to reduce taxation but also to manage earnings. So Positive\nAccounting Theory is justified here. The author (Vivien Beatte, 1994) also stated that\nthis practice has been very common in large corporations in United Kingdom.\nThis\nargument can be better understood by the concept which (Watts, 1978)\nintroduced i.e. Political Costs. According to them, politicians have the power\nto impact the businesses and all other stakeholders can also impact business by\nquestioning on the reported income or changing tax laws, subsidies, or by\nbringing any social changes.\nSo\nin order to avoid these impacts and divert the attention, businesses start\nsocial and responsibility campaigns.\n§Corporations employ a number of devices,\nsuch as social responsibility campaigns in the media, government lobbying and\nselection of accounting procedures to minimize reported earnings. By avoiding\nthe attention that \"high\" profits draw because of the public's association of\nhigh reported profits and monopoly rents, management can reduce the likelihood\nof adverse political actions and, thereby, reduce its expected costs (including\nthe legal costs the firm would incur opposing the political actions). Included\nin political costs are the costs labor unions impose through increased demands\ngenerated by large reported profits.\n§The\nmagnitude of the political costs is highly dependent on firm size.\n§The\namount spent on the social disclosures and social responsibility campaigns are\nthe political Costs.

If any questions are raised against their\nmonopolistic behavior or unethical practices, they immediately start the\nadvocacy advertising. In Pakistan lays started such advertising advocacy.\nAccording\nto (Sethi, 1977)\nthe purpose of advocacy advertising is that companies defend themselves against\nslander and unfair treatment in media as Mobil Oil did.

{"text": "Whistleblowing: When do employees act to 'blow the whistle'?\nThe term 'whistleblowing' dates back many years, originating from the way the police officers used to blow their whistles, while witnessing a law being violated in order to signal and attract attention. Whistleblowing has always been important for every organization and individual, as every company, either private or public could be put in jeopardy if things might not turn out favorably. In fact, it has evolved so much over the past years that from a derogatory term it is now utilized as a tool to aid employees on how they can report misconduct while highlighting existing choices. It can be a very powerful tool in strengthening corporate governance, ethics, and improving internal organizational culture through setting up formal whistleblowing procedures, but it can also prove a powerful tool in reducing corruption.\nThis study reflect on whether gender differences play a paramount role in the decision-making process within an organization. These issues are considered in terms of employees making the right choice to act against unethical practices. The authors empirically investigate the various gender attitudes in the firms while providing an overview of why men and women choose to blow the whistle. This is accomplished by concentrating on two questions: Are gender differences evident in the course of deciding if they should whistleblow? Are women more likely to whistleblow due to their stereotypical image as emotional and caring? We designed a questionnaire survey in such a way that all participants were fully informed about the scope of the research and that questionnaires would remain anonymous and the information provided would only be used for the purpose of this research. The questionnaire was distributed to medium-large organizations, which were more likely to be aware of the different whistleblowing practices. The findings are based on a sample group of 153 participants.\nThe findings of this study demonstrate that gender differences are only evident in the course of performing this action. Thus, even though both genders support that whistleblowing is something that everybody should do when witnessing unethical behavior, women are more likely to act upon it. Following this thread of thought, this research has seized on the opportunity to further analyze the reasons as to under what circumstances employees would whistle-blow and why. However, for the purpose of identifying gender differences in whistleblowing, using the data gathered it has been established that in cases that involve health issues, one is more likely to whistleblow whereas in cases concerning fraud, or illegal activities, one is less likely to do so. It is also evident that individuals have a stronger inclination to whistleblow when others are also aware of the situation. This study has managerial implications. Indeed, managers can perceive how genders react with whistleblowing, which is of high importance in the corporate world while identifying that women are more likely to have the willpower to report an incident; while firms and organizations can direct their focus to how to encourage male employees to whistleblow.\n\nQuestion: What was one of the key findings of the study? Answer: One of the key findings was that women are more likely to act upon whistleblowing when witnessing unethical behavior compared to men.\n\nQuestion: What can managers learn from this study about gender differences in whistleblowing? Answer: Managers can learn that women are more likely to have the willpower to report an incident, while firms and organizations can direct their focus to how to encourage male employees to whistleblow.", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "2343fdf6-f85c-430a-86d0-722789e1ab2e", "url": "https://recherche.inseec.com/whistleblowing-when-do-employees-act-to-blow-the-whistle/"}

{"text": "Teaching Kids About Discipleship\nWhen our children are old enough to really understand the concept of sin and the impact of sin in their lives, we call that the age of accountability. Scriptures teach us when each of us reaches that age, we have a decision to make. We must decide if we will obey God and be baptized for the forgiveness of our sins, or walk away and live our lives in pursuit of our own desires.\nProbably the happiest day for a parent (after the birth of their child), is the day their child is baptized. In many homes, Bibles are searched and studied as the child prepares to make the most important decision of his life. Then the day arrives when your child walks into the baptistry and is immersed for the reemission of her sins. Many parents breathe a sigh of relief. If the child is close to adulthood, the sigh may be huge!\nIn many homes, the training and Bible studies cease. Your child is a Christian and will grow (or not) in faith as time passes. Unfortunately, when that happens, we miss an enormous opportunity to teach our children about discipleship and how that affects the way they live their lives.\nDiscipleship is a word many churches no longer use, because some people have chosen to abuse the word and use it to control others. It is sad, because the Biblical concept of a disciple is so rich and can add so much to the Christian walk of our children. The closest thing to a disciple we have in modern society might be an artisan's apprentice, but discipleship is so much more.\nIn my next post, I will give you some ideas for helping your children become active disciples. Today, I want to share some things I learned about disciples during the time of Jesus. I think having this background will help us model our own discipleship a little better.\nDisciples were very common in the time of Christ. They followed various rabbis (teachers).\nA person had to request from the rabbi permission to become a disciple. Without the permission of the rabbi, one could not become a disciple.\nDisciples often sacrificed careers, homes, family and friends to travel around with the rabbi, often under harsh conditions.\nThe disciple was to place the needs of the rabbi over even the needs of family. The saying was basically, \"a father only gives you life, but the rabbi gives you wisdom\".\nDisciples had to agree to totally submit to the rabbi's interpretation of the scriptures and how it applied to their lives.\nDisciples had significant daily interaction with and teaching from their rabbi.\nDisciples were expected not to just follow a list of rules, but understand why they were rules.\nDisciples often copied everything about their rabbi.\nDisciples were viewed as zealous, enthusiastic supporters of their rabbi.\nJesus had those same expectations of his disciples and even added a few more that were not common in his time.\nJesus expected his disciples to serve others.\nJesus expected his disciples to act as brothers and not \"rabbi\" each other.\nJesus encouraged women disciples.\n\nQuestion: What was one of the unique expectations Jesus had for his disciples? Answer: To serve others.\n\nQuestion: What were some sacrifices disciples had to make in the time of Christ?

Relaxation of the entire nervous system is another part of the body's reaction to acupuncture needle stimulation – taking the body from a \"fight or flight\" mode to a \"relax and repair\"state plays a huge role in speeding up repair of cells and tissues, and healing processes within affected areas of the body.\nHow acupuncture can reduce stress & soothe over-stimulated nerves\nThis is What Busy, Overly Stressed People Look Like Before an Acupuncture Treatment\nAcupuncture has demonstrated impressive anti-stress properties in both clinical applications and in research studies. Stress is often a component of symptoms such as heart palpitations, anxiety attacks, insomnia, and just plain old, difficulty in relaxing! This effect of regulating the nervous system and balancing over-stimulation of the sympathetic nerves is also crucial for promoting efficient function of our innate detoxification system, along with allowing efficient nutrient absorption and preventing digestive issues.\nIn our fast-paced modern lives, it has become increasingly difficult for many of us to successfully manage stress and maintain healthy sleep cycles, and to avoid digestive issues (think bloating, food sensitivities or allergies, acid reflux/GERD, constipation, diarrhea, IBS, colitis, crohn's disease, intestinal permeability, etc.).\nWhen nutrient absorption becomes compromised, our cells lose critical sources of building blocks, including minerals such as magnesium. Magnesium is needed for vast numbers of processes to carry on in the body, from muscle relaxation, to energy production, and protection against accumulation of toxins, such as heavy metals.\nIntroducing magnesium, the anti-stress mineral!\nMagnesium is a nutritional mineral that serves a vast number of critical functions in the body.\nMagnesium is vital in particular for proper rhythm of heart muscle contraction. If you've ever suffered from palpitations (feelings of having a rapid, fluttering, or pounding heartbeat), I highly recommend the combination of a course of acupuncture treatments along with supplementing magnesium and generally a few other co-factors that are needed to absorb magnesium into our cells. This approach can play a huge role in preventing heart palpitations as well as anxiety attacks, insomnia, and excess muscle tension or tension headaches.\n\nQuestion: What is the role of magnesium in the body?

I'm sure there are others there, but i suspect that a lot of the people in sl are people who are targetsof some kind off discrimination in rl (real life). i surely fit into that category. in a metafilter post, a lot of the othered social categories and the animosity towards them was summed up in this comment:\nAlso, the stats that Linden Labs publish show that US users are only about 25% of people on SL and there are people from many, many other countries outside of the US.\nWhen I first bought a furry avatar, i still had to choose male or female, they are still totally gendered… This brought me to thinking about the limits of gender.

{"text": "Fishing stories by Rob Beattie\nBob\nSometimes it doesn't take much to sum up a fishing trip. There's always the temptation to over-think or over-write what's gone on, but usually the fewer words you use, the better. Especially when there's not actually very much to say. The day was bright - too bright as it turned out - and the water still cold from the long winter, so it wasn't surprising that the fish weren't really interested. I saw one carp banked - not by me - and it came in like a small sack of spuds, barely bothered enough to flick its tail. Nice fish though.\nAs for me, all the action was concentrated into a single moment just as the sun went down. Bob, went the float. Bob. (That's me repeating the same bite for emphasis, rather than me describing a second bite). And that was that.\nReaders expecting a bit more action than that after all this time, I'm sorry for your trouble and I apologise if you feel you've wasted the last two minutes. You should have been there for the other four hours...\n\nQuestion: How long was the author fishing before the bite?

{"text": "Wednesday, October 6, 2010\nSpin Etiquette\nWe have gone to the morning spin class at LA Fitness in Ballard for about a one year and a half now. Here are some rules which would be nice if fellow spinners and those who use the spin room followed:\n1. Don't drag a bike to some corner and then leave it there. It's interpreted as out of order and generally causes confusion. This most often happens when someone comes in when the class is not in progress (most of the day) and drags a bike to look out a window, for example, out of the normal \"formation\" and never puts it back.\n2. Don't leave a dirty towel or any towel on the bike unless you intend to indicate you are reserving the bike for an upcoming class. Again, this usually happens when people during non-class hours get lazy and leave a towel on the bike which is later interpreted as \"reserved\" by people arriving for the next class.\n3. Don't aim the fan toward the two bikes at the side of the room; it's intended to cool the other 25+ riders. (The room is set up so that two bikes are off to the instructor's left.)\n4. If you are leaving early don't sit in the front row. It's annoying and disruptive.\n5. Don't be possessive about bikes. People become so fixated on getting their favorite bike or position that behavior begins to get strange. Be adventurous and try different bikes and positions in the room.\n6. Don't talk at length while the spin class is in progress. A couple of words or sentences, fine. Extended conversations, no.\n7. Check your biking shorts for holes and rips. It's not all that interesting to be behind some unintended skin exposure, especially during the hovers.\n8. If you ate a whole bunch of garlic the night before, chances are the class hasn't and will be suffering.\n\nQuestion: What should you check for before attending a spin class?

{"text": "How many turns do we make on any given day? Not just actual ones, like those turns while driving a car, but figurative ones, as well. If a person approaches you and asks, \"Did you make the right turn?\" — what is the response? Is there a \"right\" answer? Is there a relationship in the English language between the terms \"right\", \"left\" and the physical attributes we possess?\nIf a person tells of another, \"He's way out in left field,\" is that because we attribute the term \"left\" with residues of the negative? And, how did the terms \"left\" and \"right\", when referred to in politics, come to have a meaning of equivalency? Was the fact that right-hand dominance was historically preferred to left-handedness, to the extent that teachers once used to punish those students who naturally attempted to utilize their left hands in handwriting, drawing, etc., account for the linguistic dominance and preference given to the term \"right\" as opposed to \"left\".\nDo we understand the concept with greater presumption when a person says, \"He made a left turn and got lost,\" even if the person actually made a right turn and found himself in an unfamiliar neighborhood? And what of \"meaningful\" turns – are there such things, as opposed to spurious and meaningless ones? How often we confuse and conflate language with figurative speech and objective facts; and then we wonder why most people wander through life with confusion, puzzlement and an inability to cope.\nRussell and the entire contingent of British linguistic philosophers, of course, attempted to relegate all of the problems of philosophy to a confusion with language – and, of course, only the British, with their history of Shakespeare and the sophistication of language, its proper usage and correctness of applicability could possess the arrogance of making such an argument.\nBut back to \"meaningful turns\" – in one sense, in the \"real world\", every turn is meaningful to the extent that we turn and proceed towards a destination of intended resolve. But in the figurative sense, it refers to the steps we take in mapping out consequential decisions.\nFor Federal employees and U.S. Postal workers who suffer from a medical condition, such that the medical condition begins to prevent the Federal or Postal worker from performing one or more of the essential elements of the Federal or Postal worker's position and duties, the \"meaningful turn\" that one must consider should by necessity ask many questions: How long can I continue in this job? What are the consequences of my staying, both to my health as well as from the Agency's perspective? How long before my agency realizes that I am not capable of doing all of the essential elements of my job? Will my excessive use of SL, AL or LWOP become a problem with the agency? And what about my health? necessarily\n\nQuestion: How did the terms \"left\" and \"right\" come to have political meanings? Answer: The text suggests it could be related to historical preference for right-hand dominance.\n\nQuestion: Why might a person be described as \"way out in left field\"? Answer: The text suggests it could be due to attributing the term \"left\" with negative residues.", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "9f9bcc34-2011-4883-a5e5-ba9cccedc902", "url": "https://federaldisabilityretirement.wordpress.com/tag/opm-disability-form/"}

This Article discusses how and when courts should decide \"gateway\" issues in international arbitration, issues that go to the validity of the agreement to arbitrate. Using the examples of France and Germany, the author argues that the dominant Continental doctrines used to address such issues, the doctrines of Kompetenz-Kompetenz and separability, neither adequately explain courts' decisions nor provide a strong logical basis for them. In contrast, the more nuanced U.S. approach, which involves demarcating \"gateway\" and \"non-gateway\" issues, has strong explanatory and normative force. The author demonstrates how U.S. arbitration law addresses several areas that remain problematic under the Continental doctrine. The author then argues that recognizing U.S. arbitration law's pragmatic balance between legitimacy and efficacy explains an otherwise confusing set of precedents. Finally, the author explains why the US. approach provides courts with a superior approach for responding to the Gateway problem.\n\nQuestion: Which country's approach to arbitration law is praised for its explanatory and normative force?

{"text": "The goal is to minimise the amount of 'stuff' needed on a page, and to stop any of that stuff from blocking page render. I do have a couple of things that are not quite optimal:\nI load three font files, which is a bit excessive - but I'm willing to pay that price for the design.\nI load jQuery because I'm not good enough with pure JS yet to ditch it.\nI'm not worrying about the number of HTTP requests because I'm using SPDY and will soon switch to HTTP2. I've written about why that makes a difference in another article:\nHTTP2 for front end developers.\nThat left only one problem area...\nTime To First Byte\nHaving to run any request through a CMS is inevitably slower than serving a static file.\nTTFB is a measure of how long it takes for the server to begin responding to a request by sending data to the client. For static files on this website that number is typically in the 20 to 40 millisecond range, which is essentially imperceptible.\nHowever, when requesting a page that's routed through the CMS, such as the homepage, the Time To First Byte is much larger - and becomes noticeable.\nThis is because the CMS must generate the HTML of the page being requested. For my homepage it's gathering all the articles that I've written, sorting and filtering them into groups, extracting certain fields, creating pagination, and then spitting it all out as HTML. All of that can take a second or so, depending on the amount of content being manipulated and complexity of the relations between the content types.\nUsing Craft's cache feature\nCraft is a great CMS, and so it has techniques to help mitigate complex queries impacting performance - specifically it has\ncache tags. These can be wrapped around expensive bits of code, and Craft will then store the results of that code in the database; the next time the page is requested Craft will use the previous result instead of doing all the work again. Using these tags I was able to get the homepage TTFB down to about 0.3 seconds - just using that tag lopped about a second off the TTFB.\nThat's great, but still not on the same order as fetching a static file. Despite the cache tag removing a lot of computation, it still has to execute a bunch of database calls in order to fetch the content of the tag.\nTo be clear; I'm being\nvery fussy by bothering about a 0.3s TTFB; but I want to see how much I can push things on my site...\nUsing nginx's fastcgi_cache\nWith this technique, we can essentially skip the CMS entirely for front-end page requests.\nNginx has a built in way to store the results of a PHP call, so the next time it's needed it can pull the stored result from memory, rather than have PHP do the work again. This is a bit like Craft's cache tag, only even more efficient.\nThings to be aware of\nNginx doesn't provide a way to clear its cache when something in the CMS changes.\n\nQuestion: How did the author improve the TTFB for the homepage using Craft's cache feature? Answer: The author used Craft's cache tags to store the results of expensive code, reducing the TTFB to about 0.3 seconds.", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "df981eef-fe32-4e6a-9d33-00d1e1587832", "url": "https://mattwilcox.net/web-development/speed-up-website-response-times-with-nginx"}
{"text": "Colorado Springs gets a lot of hail. Anyone who has lived here very long knows that hail is part of life. But in the 25 years we've called Colorado home, we've never seen a summer like this one. Three times in the past three months, the south end of town has been pummeled by huge hailstones— softball-sized cannonballs from the clouds that demolished anything in their path. Gardens, cars, roofs, windows—the damage is devastating.\nSadly, the most recent storm also injured dozens of people, some seriously enough to be hospitalized, and killed five animals at the renowned Cheyenne Mountain Zoo. Today's memorial post is dedicated to Cape Vulture (aka Cape Griffon) Motswari, an ambassador for her species and for vultures worldwide.\nVultures are often maligned. We're trained from childhood to consider them evil, dirty, nasty birds. Google \"vulture cartoon\" and see what pops up—they're depicted as hunched over, menacing creatures. But think about it for a moment. Where would we be without vultures?\nVultures, and other animals that eat carrion, play an essential role in any ecosystem. Imagine if nothing ever came to clean up the mess that predators leave behind. What about the flattened creatures that decorate our roads?\nBut an even more essential role is that of toxic waste clean-up worker. Even other scavengers (such as dogs and hyenas) know better than to eat animals felled by disease. Vultures, however, have extremely corrosive stomach acid that can render harmless the most deadly of diseases, including anthrax, botulism, rabies, and cholera. Imagine the epidemics that would result, among animals and humans, if vultures weren't on the job!\nWhile their food may be disgusting, vultures are actually rather clean birds. Having a naked head means that bits of food won't get stuck in their feathers, and they disinfect their legs after dinner (yes, by defecating on them, but hey, it works).\nUnfortunately, vulture species worldwide are in serious decline, primarily due to human activity. Poisoned carcasses aimed at killing jackals, rats, and other scavengers also kill vultures, sometimes in huge numbers. The California Condor nearly went extinct, and is still severely endangered, due to lead poisoning from bullets in piles of offal left behind by hunters field-dressing their take. And in India, more than 95% of the resident vultures died off between 1990 and the early 2000s, due to the use of a veterinary drug used in cattle that proved to be highly toxic to the birds. Thankfully, that drug is now banned, and the population has stabilized, and may be slowly recovering.\n\nQuestion: Which vulture species was Motswari?

{"text": "Posts\nBusy Week Producing? Plan Your Meals\nHave you ever been super busy producing music and after several hours realize you accidentally skipped lunch?\nI have, often.\nWhen I have a busy day (or week) producing, I often get lost in the work and hours just fly by. Sometimes I may eat quite poorly because I just forget to eat. But that's not good.\nIf you really want to stay sharp, be creative, be productive and have energy, you need to eat. Your mind and body needs fuel. It's just a fact.\nBut you don't want to waste time and energy in the middle of the day deciding what to eat, when to eat, and even worse, spending hours buying groceries and cooking food. Also, chances are you will also choose the unhealthy option because it's the quickest, right?\nI recommend planning your meals in advance when you know you're going to be busy. You need to make sure your nutrition is on point.\nYou just cannot be on top of your game (at least for long!) if you eat poorly.\n1. Plan Each Meal In Advance\nWhen you start the day, you should have an idea what you're going to have for lunch and dinner. This will save you time and mental energy during the day. You don't have to think, you just do.\nFun Fact: Did you know that many high-achieving people even wear the same clothes every day (different pair) to save them mental energy for more important decisions? In fact, it's scientifically proven that our minds have only a limited amount of decisions for any given day. High-achievers know this.\nIt may sound useless, but it really helps to plan your meals in advance. You can focus the energy and time you save for work.\nUsually on Sunday, I set up a mean plan for the upcoming week. I write down each lunch and dinner I'm going to have. If you eat out often, just have a list of restaurants you can choose from. If you cook your meals, then you should have the exact meals written down.\n2. Buy Groceries\nOne of the worst time-wasters is to go to the supermarket every day to buy groceries! You can easily spend an hour on each trip.\nBuying groceries for the entire week can significantly save you time and energy. It just makes life easier. If you want a snack, go to the fridge. When you want dinner, go to the fridge.\n(Every once in a while I might buy groceries for the entire month! I can go into work-mode for an entire month without having to worry about food at all.)\nBut how can you know EVERYTHING you need for the entire week? Once you have each lunch and dinner planned, it's quite easy. Now you just need to figure out everything else. What do you have for breakfast? What about snacks? And don't forget the coffee!\nBy the way, you will always forget something but that's fine.The goal is to buy majority of the groceries.\n\nQuestion: What is one reason why planning meals in advance is beneficial?

{"text": "Review: Triple 9 Pulls the Trigger on Cop Thriller\nIt's a fine line between right and wrong and one that all the players in Triple 9 seem to be walking in a tense heist thriller. As the film opens, we see a gang of criminals enter a bank and strategically make their getaway with a safe deposit box that will seemingly set them up for a windfall. But it's not that simple. This gang includes a pair of cops who've crossed the line along with a leader essentially having his strings pulled by a female mob boss using his son as leverage.\nChiwetel Ejiofor is Michael Atwood, the former special ops leader of this crew who finds himself at the will of Irina Vlaslov, a ruthless mob boss played by a nearly unrecognizable Kate Winslet determined to set her jailed husband free from a Russian prison by employing Atwood's crew to do her bidding. Irina's sister Elena (Gal Godot) had a prior tryst with Michael and aunt Elena is using the youth's freedom to hold over Atwood's head.\nThe rest of Atwood's crew includes his right hand man Russell Welch (Norman Reedus), Russell's former cop and recovering addict brother Gabe (Aaron Paul), a dirty cop named Franco (Clifton Collins Jr.) and a bit of an unknown in officer Marcus Belmont (Anthony Mackie) who has been pressed into action for the heist. Thinking they've done their job and are about to get paid, sadly Atwood learns that Irina is leveraging him for a bigger job to complete the task and to drive the point home, she whisks away Atwood's son and has a member of the crew snuffed out.\nUnsure of how to pull off a heist of a homeland security office, Marcus suggests a 999, which is code for killing a police officer. Knowing that all resources will be devoted to finding the officer's killer, that leaves the target of their theft less guarded than normal. He suggests his new partner, officer Chris Allen (Casey Affleck), as the target.\nAllen is bright but rough and after initially butting heads with Marcus on the job, he manages to save Marcus' life during a home invasion. Meanwhile, Allen's uncle Jeffery (Woody Harrelson), a veteran cop with a beat on the heist, begins to close in on the crew. As the second heist nears, allegiances begin to get tested, the stakes are raised and the twists and turns begin to unfold with a lot of bloodshed to follow. How it all plays out is all part of the intrigue of the John Hillcoat-directed film.\n\nQuestion: Who is suggested as the target for the 999 by Marcus?

{"text": "The ICCPR was framed in the period from the late 1940s to the early 1960s when same-sex marriage was limited to a few tribal and traditional communities and there was no recognition of same-sex marriage within any extant legal system that was based primarily on the formulation of written rules, as opposed to custom.[11] Indeed, in 1966, when the ICCPR was concluded, it would be seven years before the American Psychiatric Association declassified homosexuality as a mental disorder and twenty-four years before the World Health Organization removed homosexuality from its list of mental illnesses.[12] Nevertheless, we are currently writing a paper (which Oscar will speak to at the Australasian Society of Legal Philosophy Conference in Auckland, New Zealand later this month) in which we argue that even an originalist reading of Art 23(2) can guarantee a right to marry a person of the same sex.\nOur argument is based on two propositions which are consistent with Article 31 of the Vienna Convention on the Interpretation of Treaties ('Vienna Convention'). The first proposition is that treaties must be read in accordance with their ordinary meaning and the second proposition is that treaty provisions must be read in their context, which includes the other provisions of the treaty.\nIn accordance with our first proposition we stipulate that the interpretation of Art 23(2) is based on the conception of marriage when the ICCPR was framed. However, in accordance with our second proposition, Art 23(2) must also be read in the context of Arts 2 and 26 of the ICCPR which provide that State Parties cannot discriminate against individuals subject to their jurisdiction. We then defer to philosophers in political and legal theory who argue that it is discriminatory not to give a person a right to marry another person of the same sex.\n\nQuestion: Where will the paper arguing for same-sex marriage rights be presented?

If a self-injectable medication is prescribed by your physician, a one-on-one training session will be provided to the patient and caregiver(s) involved in administering the medication.\nAll trainings take place in our Patient Education Suite which helps eliminate interruptions and allows for focused teaching time. Although most trainings can be accomplished within 1-1 1/2 hours, there is no time limit for training sessions. We recognize that each patient comes to us with unique needs and must learn at his or her own pace. In addition, we strive to provide sufficient time to answer any questions as they arise during the training session. Our goal is for the patient to feel comfortable with taking their medication prior to leaving the Center.\nDuring the training session, nurses will instruct the patient on all aspects of their prescribed medication including mechanism of action, side effects and proper location of injection sites. If appropriate, use of an automatic injection device is also reviewed. The nurse will demonstrate step-by-step how to properly set up and administer the medication using both verbal instruction and hands-on practice with a replica of an injection site. Patients and family are strongly encouraged to practice administration of their medication on this replica with saline injections at this time.\nMost injectable medications must be started at low doses and gradually increased over time. This is called titration. As part of the injection training, the nurse will inform the patient of how to properly titrate medication. The patient and nursing staff remain in close contact on a weekly basis to discuss when to increase the dose of medicine, any side effects, and answer any questions that may arise. This will continue until the patient is comfortable administering their medication and is on a full dose without any difficulty.\nMost patients are able to learn quickly in this atmosphere and refresher trainings are always available by appointment.\nSome oral medications also need to be increased slowly. Should a patient be prescribed one of these medications, our nursing staff is well versed in proper titration. Through our daily phone line, we are available to help determine proper and safe medication increases. As always, any side effects of medications or questions that may arise can also be discussed at this time.

Living with MS can be challenging and long lasting changes in mood could be due to managing these challenges or directly as a result of MS and its effect on the central nervous system.\nTreatment usually works well.

You can find your local group here:\nDepression\nIt is estimated that about half of all people with multiple sclerosis will experience an episode of depression at some stage. Depression involves persistent sadness lasting more than two weeks, accompanied by other symptoms such as an altered sleep pattern, feelings of hopelessness, guilt and low self esteem, thoughts of death, reduced energy and the inability to concentrate and to take pleasure in anything.\nIt is important to distinguish clinical depression, which is persistent, from episodes of low mood, which tend to resolve after a period of time.\nInappropriate laughing or crying\nSome people with multiple sclerosis find that they laugh or cry with little reason or at inappropriate times. This is because MS lesions have occurred in an area of the brain that is involved in controlling the emotional pathways. These symptoms are called pseudobulbar affect.\nThis is a physical disorder which occurs, not because someone truly feels happy or sad but because their ability to control the expression of their feelings is disrupted by MS.\nBipolar disorder\nThe study reported above shows that bipolar disorder is common in people with MS.

Cutting those habits can be tricky, but it has saved her tens of thousands of dollars, and she's been able to shift that money to experiences like traveling abroad that have brought her much more happiness. Wright suggests waiting at least an hour before buying something for every $10 it costs—so 10 hours for a $100 item, 100 hours for $1,000. \"Much of what we buy can seem justifiable in the moment but then, once the emotional, chemical thrill of acquiring some new doodad is gone, we're left with stuff that doesn't actually add anything to our lives, and which can instead become a burden,\" he says. Be sure to check your subscriptions, too, and cancel anything you're not actively using.\nConstantly analyze your expenses\nBy keeping a physical diary of your spending, you can often shame yourself out of unnecessary expenses. It forces you to think, \"I have to write down that I just spent $6 on a latte, and I don't want to have to do that,\" Moe says.\nWright suggests the same: \"There's nothing wrong with that relatively expensive daily coffee habit,\" he says, \"just make sure it's worth what you're paying, that there's no legitimate and cheaper alternative, and that it's worth what you're giving up: savings and alternative uses for that money.\"\nPlan your meals so you don't waste food (and money)\nPeople waste an unbelievable amount of money on food and alcohol, Moe says. It's eating out and all those $5 lattes, beers, and kombuchas, when you could make or buy alternatives to stock your fridge. And you likely literally throw away hundreds or thousands of dollars' worth of food every year when you let leftovers and unused produce rot before you eat them. Instead of taking one-off shopping trips for every meal, plan out in advance what you want to cook for the week, so you can re-use ingredients. If she had to buy a bunch of five green onions, Moe said she would \"find so many dishes to use green onions in,\" to make sure they didn't go to waste. (Check out our guide to eating from Trader Joe's for a week under $50 for some help getting started.)\nKnow when to splurge\nInstead of eating out, take the time to cook—invite friends over for a potluck so you can all save together, Moe says—and splurge at the grocery store, where money goes further.

{"text": "DOH-Pinellas Hepatitis Screenings in Pinellas on July 24\nShare This Page\nHepatitis Screenings in Pinellas on July 24\n--World Hepatitis Day Raises Awareness of Prevention and Treatment--\nThere's a chronic disease that--in two of its forms--affects 400 million people around the world and kills 1.4 million of them each year. The good news is that it's preventable and better awareness of how it's transmitted and how to avoid it could save millions of people.\nViral hepatitis continues to be a public-health threat. Hepatitis B and C are chronic diseases transmitted via blood and other body fluids. They affect the liver and can cause cancer, cirrhosis and death. Although there's a vaccine to prevent hepatitis B, there's none for hepatitis C. Contact with the blood of an infected person, unsafe injections and sharing needles with drug users who have hepatitis transmit the disease.\nAlthough World Hepatitis Day is marked annually on July 28, a community event on Friday, July 24 will offer screenings and testing a few days earlier. The Florida Department of Health in Pinellas County (DOH-Pinellas) and other community organizations are partnering with the Walgreens store location at 875 Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. St. N. in St. Petersburg to promote awareness of hepatitis prevention. At no cost, hepatitis screenings and other wellness screenings will be provided from 11 AM to 4 PM that day only.\nIn 2014, World Health Assembly delegates from 194 governments adopted a resolution to promote global action to prevent, diagnose and treat viral hepatitis. World Hepatitis Day is observed on July 28 because it's the birthday of Novel Laureate Dr. Baruch S. Blumberg, who discovered the hepatitis B virus and developed the first vaccine to prevent it.\n\nQuestion: What are the operating hours for the hepatitis screenings event?

{"text": "Endoscopic Ultrasound\nEndoscopic Ultrasound (EUS) combines endoscopy and ultrasound to examine the walls and lining of your upper and lower gastrointestinal tract as well as the surrounding tissue and organs. Using a specialized endoscope with an ultrasound probe on the tip sound waves create high quality visual images of the organs and structures inside the digestive tract. An Upper Endoscopy involves the esophagus (swallowing tube), stomach and duodenum (first portion of the small intestine). While a lower endoscopy includes your colon and rectum. EUS is also used to examine organs near the gastrointestinal track including the gall bladder, pancreas, liver and bile ducts and obtain tissue samples. Using ultrasound guidance a needle is passed through the endoscope into enlarged lymph nodes or suspicious tumors from which cells are removed and later examined by a pathologist. This process of obtaining tissue is referred to as fine needle aspiration (FNA).\nThere are many reasons your doctor may request a EUS Endoscopic Ultrasound. The most common include the following symptoms or diseases:\nEvaluate findings diagnosed by another procedure such as an X-ray or CT scan.\nStaging of cancers of the lung, esophagus, stomach, pancreas and rectum.\nEvaluate chronic pancreatitis and other masses or cysts of the pancreas.\nStudying abnormalities including stones and tumors in the bile duct, gall bladder or liver.\nStudying the muscles of the lower rectum and anal canal.\nEvaluate submucosal lesions such as nodules in the intestinal tract.\nStudy blood flow inside blood vessels.\nPreparation for an Upper EUS is minimal. Your stomach should be completely empty. You should have nothing to eat or drink for 8 hours prior to the examination. Your doctor will be more specific about the time to begin fasting depending on the time of day that your test is scheduled. You should not smoke or chew gum for at least 6 hours prior to the exam.\nPreparation for a Lower EUS is similar to that of a colonoscopy. Your colon must be clean in order for your physician to get the best view possible. A special liquid diet followed by a laxative preparation is necessary to clear out any waste or solid residue. There are several different types of preparations and your physician will determine which is best for you. Some require a prescription and usually at least 24 hours of following a diet consisting of \"clear\" liquids). It is very important that your physician's instructions be followed carefully. The quality of the preparation can affect the physician's ability to detect abnormalities in the colon. Any solid material retained in the colon may prolong the procedure or make it necessary to repeat the examination on another day physician.\n\nQuestion: Which organs near the gastrointestinal tract can be examined using EUS?\nAnswer: The gall bladder, pancreas, liver, and bile ducts\n\nQuestion: What are the two main components of Endoscopic Ultrasound (EUS)?\nAnswer: Endoscopy and ultrasound\n\nQuestion: What is required for a Lower EUS to get the best view of the colon?\nAnswer: A clean colon, achieved through a liquid diet and laxative preparation", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "cda82545-21a9-48a1-bc3c-4a6b188c5bc4", "url": "http://www.esecgi.com/services-endo-ultrasound.html"}

Public Prep now educates nearly 2,000 scholars currently attending Girls Prep Lower East Side, Girls Prep Bronx and Boys Prep Bronx schools. Moreover, there are now almost 350 Girls Prep alumnae attending some of the best public, private and parochial high schools, and we are proud to say, for the first time, some of the finest colleges and universities in the country.\nIndeed, on June 28th, 2017, nearly 1,500 family members, friends, past and current faculty, alumnae, and scholars created a wonderful, new tradition by attending Public Prep's first-ever unified graduation ceremony on a college campus. The event was the culmination of a very special year that marked the first time in which both Girls Prep Lower East Side and Girls Prep Bronx graduated 8th grade scholars. We also honored the inaugural Girls Prep cohort of 47 scholars that graduated from 8th grade in 2013, who were now graduating seniors, and about to embark upon their post-secondary plans.\nThere was a lot to celebrate.\nFour years after they graduated Girls Prep, a stunning ninety percent of that Class of 2013 received on average nearly five offers of admission, and cumulatively received more than $5 million in scholarship offers. The fact that such an overwhelming number of Girls Prep alumnae were accepted into and will be attending some of the finest colleges and universities in the country is the best evidence of the positive, longitudinal impact of our work.\n\nQuestion: Which is the oldest and only non-profit network that exclusively develops exceptional PrePrep and single-sex elementary and middle public charter schools in the nation?

{"text": "Platonos\nWhy?\nThe motivation for this website is to encourage deep conversations between people on the internet.\nWe do this by focusing on two aspects of the platform. First, all users are anonymous, as this will strip all social constraints that prevent them from sharing honest thoughts. Second, automatically randomizes another user and invite him/her to chat. This reduces the total number of steps to have a chat on the platform to one (creating a topic).\nWhy do this? There is the term on the internet called lurkers, which are members of an online community who observes, but not participate. The ratio of lurkers seems to be huge. There is nothing wrong with this. They may just want to consume information. Or, they might think that they have to learn about the community first, before being able to provide productive contributions.\nWhile these are all good reasons, I believe that most of the time, they are caused by fear. Fear comes from having options to do otherwise, to escape. The best way to resolve fear is to limit the number of options people can take. Let a system decides instead. Users don't have to think much because it's already in the process.\nHow it works\nAn author creates a topic.\nA random match is invited.\nThe match either accepts or rejects the invitation. If accept, the talk starts immediately. If reject, another user is invited.\nTechnical Details\nThe random algorithm is very simple at this stage.

{"text": "The map clearly shows the \"German Belt\" which the articles says stretches from Galveston to Hondo. Also there is also a speckling of German and northern European settlements throughout the state, excluding the border region.\nHere are some more of the highlights from the article:\nIn the late 1830s German immigration to Texas was widely publicized in the Fatherland….\nTheir organization, variously called the Adelsverein, the Verein zum Schutze Deutscher Einwanderer in Texas, or the German Emigration Company, began work in the early 1840s… Between 1844 and 1847 more than 7,000 Germans reached the new land. Some of the immigrants perished in epidemics, many stayed in cities such as Galveston, Houston, and San Antonio, and others settled in the rugged Texas Hill Country to form the western end of the German Belt. The Adelsverein founded the towns of New Braunfels and Fredericksburg.\nMost of the German immigrant clusters came from west central Germany, particularly Nassau, southern Hanover, Brunswick, Hesse, and western Thuringia.\n…\nAt about the same time, another colonization project was launched. The Frenchman Henri Castro directed a project that moved more than 2,000 German-speaking settlers, mainly from clusters in the Upper Rhine Plain of Alsace, to Medina County, west of San Antonio. Castroville, founded in 1844, became the nucleus of the Alsatian colony, though many of the immigrants settled in San Antonio because of better economic opportunities there….The Germans were ambitious farmers and artisans who believed their futures were cramped by the social and economic system at home. They were not poverty-stricken and oppressed. Indeed, they were able to afford the substantial cash investment required in overseas migration.\nBy 1850, when the organized projects ended, the German Belt in Texas was well established…After the Civil War ended, ships loaded with German immigrants once again unloaded at the Galveston wharves. From 1865 to the early 1890s, more Germans arrived in Texas than during the thirty years before the war. The number probably reached 40,000. Many of them settled in the rural areas and towns of the German Belt. Interestingly, the postbellum immigrants generally avoided the Hill Country.\n…By the 1880s German ethnic-islands dotted north central, northern, and western Texas. Ethnic islands failed to develop in East Texas, the Trans-Pecos, and the Rio Grande valley, however. As early as 1881, Germans founded the colony of Marienfeld (later Stanton) on the High Plains of West Texas. It was one of the first agricultural settlements in that part of the state. There the German settlers planted splendid vineyards, only to see them destroyed by drought. Most of the postbellum German colonies thrived, however…Since 1930 the extent of the German-settled area has changed very little, though a considerable post-World War II German immigration was directed to Texas cities.\n\nQuestion: How many German immigrants reached Texas between 1844 and 1847?

(for plugged in use, mainly)\ni've had it for more than a decade now. it doesn't get much use because i'm not really a bass player, so it only gets pulled out for recording and odd projects and the like. but i don't think i've tuned it once in all that time, and i certainly haven't changed the strings (as is my preference with basses). but it sounds great, its a lot of fun to play and it certainly gets some attention. am i wrong in thinking the sound is sort of unique? maybe kind of electric-y, but not in a bad way? not a million miles away from a hofner. but maybe its just my set up and the need for better stringsIfOK I'll help.\nAlthough I've never owned a B4ce- it's on my bucket list of pieces to get one day to satisfy my inner wanna-be bass player.\nThis is aimed a checking an acoustic guitar's neck angel, I suspect it would apply just as well to a B4ce:\nSpecifically I'm citing the \"straightedge test\".\nI would assume the alignment principle between the plane of the neck and the height of the bridge would be the same, since that plane is used as the basis for selecting an appropriate saddle height.\nAnd Guilds of the '90's were typically shipped with a \"high action\" since, if nothing else, it's a whole lot easier to lower than raise it to a given owner's tastes.\nUnfortunately I've never seen a spec for \"action height\" on a Guild a/e bass.\nI'd assume it'd be a tad taller than the 6/64\" on bass E spec'd for all 6-string flat-tops in '97, but that's \"based\" on my assumption that an a/e bass strings will be more prone to buzzing and so need more fret clearance than typical 6-strings.\nI could be dead wrong about that, in which case you'd simply have a lower spec for action height on basses.\nNote also that alignment check is done with truss rod adjusted for flat and strings at tension.\nRelief can be dialed back in after the checkhow does the b4ce compare to a real big boy bass?

You can now ask Google Assistant if a certain flight has the possibility of getting delayed, and Google will give you an answer.

{"text": "The birth of feminism in the late 1960s and early 1970s featured young women burning bras as a counterpoint to young men burning their draft cards. They were considered statements of feminine independence. Now there's discussion regarding the medical merits of those demonstrations.\nControversial findings have been made that at least associate excessive bra wear to non-malignant breast fibrocystic disease as well as malignant breast cancer. Some assert there is a definite link.\nIronically, it was an American woman who invented the bra around the turn of the 20th Century. Up until the beginning of the 20th Century, corsets are what made women exhibit that desired hourglass figure and inadvertently pushed up the bust line for fashionable clothing of that time.\nProblem was, corsets messed with internal organs while shaping those hourglass figures, and their tightness resulted in women fainting easily and often.\nThe Birth of the Bra In 1893, Marie Tucek made a \"breast supporter\" that looked like a modern brassiere. But a little later Mary Phelps Jacobs designed a better version and called it a brassiere. She patented it and sold the patent to a company named Warner Brothers Corset Company in Bridgeport, Connecticut for $1,500. It caught on.\nBy the 1950s, teenage girls were urged to buy and use training bras to hold their breasts firmly in a desirable way and prevent sagging. But even the brassier industry admits that the only time bras prevent sagging is while wearing them.\nIt's been observed that using artificial breast support long enough will cause the breasts' cup shaped suspensory Cooper's ligaments to atrophy, allowing the breasts to sag over time anyway. Exercises that strengthen pectoral muscles can be helpful.\nIt's recommended to use a one piece sport bra for exercising. Some women use one piece sports bras as a healthier alternative for regular bras when not exercising.\nBras and Breast Health Consequences\nThe connection between wearing bras and painful and bothersome non-malignant breast fibrocystic disease as well as malignant breast cancer was hardly mentioned until the book Dressed to Kill by researchers Sydney Ross Singer and Soma Grismaijer came out in 1995.\nThey surveyed 5,000 women and discovered that women who wore bras for 12 hours or more greatly increased breast cancer risk than women who wore bras less.\nDr. Gregory Heigh of Florida has discovered that over 90% of women with fibrocystic breast disease find improvement when they stop wearing their brassieres. There are case testimonies (source below) from breast fibrocystic disorders who realized this when they stopped or at less lessened brassiere use.\nLoading...\nThe connection between breast tumors, non-malignant or malignant and bras has merit when considering the lymph drainage issues from wearing bras too often. The lymph system, which includes lymph nodes in the breasts, requires body movement to pump out the lymph nodes accumulation of toxic waste materials. That's what bouncing on a rebounder is about.\n\nQuestion: What is the relationship between bra usage and breast sagging? Answer: Prolonged use of bras can cause the breasts' suspensory ligaments to atrophy, leading to sagging over time\n\nQuestion: According to the text, what is the connection between bras and breast cancer? Answer: The connection is that women who wear bras for 12 hours or more may have a greater risk of breast cancer than those who wear them less\n\nQuestion: What can help improve symptoms of fibrocystic breast disease?

{"text": "Although researchers continue to uncover new information regarding caffeine, the debate surrounding the chemical is ongoing as no side has been proven right or wrong. Pate believes the answer to whether caffeine is good or bad is dependent upon the person and their habits, making the answer different for everyone. If this is true, and these habits begin to develop in high school, then the effects caffeine has on a student later in life will depend on their actions now.\nIt's the holiday season, and you're in the mood to watch something festive. The holidays are all about pine-scented candles, peppermint mochas, and as many movies as you can pack on one weekend with your loved ones. A survey was sent out to Mrs.Chan 4th period Spanish class. The students were asked to choose their top three favorite Christmas movies from a list of nine. The movies they could choose from were: The National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation, Elf, Home Alone, A Christmas Story, How the Grinch Stole Christmas, Scrooged, Frosty the Snowman, A Charlie Brown Christmas, and 8 Crazy Nights.\nIn the first place, being the best holiday movie is Elf. Since its debut in 2003, watching Elf has become a holiday tradition for many. The magical tale of Buddy's, Will Ferrell, quest to find his biological father is such a Christmas classic that viewing it is the equivalent of singing carols while eating figgy pudding as chestnuts roast near you on an open fire. There are so many reasons as to why this is the best holiday movie. Maybe it's because we've been quoting it for fifteen years, or how Buddy's newfound relationship with his family gets us every time, or maybe it's because we've always wanted to try spaghetti with maple syrup, or how Buddy's songs are masterpieces.

{"text": "Omnipresent Change\nThe world is huge. That is a fact we all generally realize, sure, but what it actually means for the earth to be what it is—so huge and so active—is a bit harder to keep in mind all of the time. Each of us have incredibly busy, crazy lives that change daily, and we just can't afford to be constantly aware of others' struggles. But this is real. Every day, you change. You learn something, you see a movie, you converse, you move, and you never stop doing things. Hence, you never stop changing. With ever-changing lives, we tend to forget about change that is happening around the world within every second, because it is not relevant to us. Change can be hard. Change can be really hard. And to realize that everybody around you is constantly being affected by change too is, well . . . maybe a good thing?\nThink about changes that are going on in your life right now. You lost your job? Your grades are awful? You're not the only person affected by these situations. Other people exist and other people's lives are altered by events and such that happen primarily in your life. The way in which we currently track time and space tells us that there is cause and effect in this universe, and whatever happens to you, happens to someone else too.\nChange happens all the time on this planet, in each and all of our lives. It can be difficult. Remembering this can be an anchor of sanity to help us remember the world isn't against us.\n\nQuestion: What does the author mean by \"the way in which we currently track time and space tells us that there is cause and effect in this universe\"?

{"text": "Environmental\nCreating Energy-Efficient Plants\nLeading by Example\nFlorida Scrub-jays\nHorse Creek\nEnergy Efficient Plants\nResponsible Plant Closure\nThermal efficiency is defined as the ability to convert a fuel into useful work. A typical \"coal-fired\" power plant has a 30% efficiency in converting the stored thermal energy in coal into useful work — in this case electrical power. In fact, the most efficient combined cycle power plants in the world are now able to achieve just over 60% thermal efficiency. The remaining energy is lost to the atmosphere.\nAt Mosaic's Bartow, Florida, plant, energy conservation and efficient generation has taken on a whole new meaning. Here, three sulfuric acid plants generate tremendous amounts of energy from the combustion, conversion and absorption of sulfur and related oxides. The total amount of thermal energy generated in one of Mosaic's sulfuric acid plants is 4.9 GJ (gigajoule) per ton of sulfuric acid produced.\nMosaic converts this energy into steam and hot water to produce new energy used to run our processing operations — all without CO2 emissions.\nHere's how it works: The steam is fed into turbines to power large rotating equipment or to generate electricity, or it's used in Mosaic's plants as a high-temperature heat source, such as in our phosphoric acid evaporators or air pre-heaters in our granulation plants. Much of the hot water generated is eventually turned into steam, or is used to evaporate water from Mosaic's process ponds. What little low-value energy that remains is cooled in a conventional cooling tower or lost to the atmosphere as hot air. By integrating Mosaic's sulfuric acid plants with the rest of our facilities, Mosaic's Bartow plant can achieve thermal efficiencies of up to 75%.\nIn addition to creating energy-efficient facilities, Mosaic is able to produce virtually all of the energy it needs to run our fertilizer manufacturing facilities and some of what we need at our mine sites. While Mosaic's Phosphates business may never be a net-zero importer of electricity, with more than 50% of the entire electrical load of Mosaic's mining and manufacturing operations running off of sulfur-based power, we may soon get close.\n\nQuestion: What is the total amount of thermal energy generated in one of Mosaic's sulfuric acid plants per ton of sulfuric acid produced?

{"text": "Presidential Fishes. Part II. A Fish Named For Richard Nixon\nPlease let Beel present a fish that surely must have been named after a Republican president.\nAs Beel sees it, surely the slippery dick Halichoeres bivittatus must have been named for former President Richard Nixon.\nActually, though, it wasn't, but you gotta wonder.\nThe slippery dick is a colorful inhabitant of inshore waters from the Western Atlantic and can be found from North Carolina to Bermuda and Brazil.\nIt gets the \"slippery\" part of its name from the abundant mucous it secretes as a defense mechanism. The \"dick\" part of its name is subject to debate, but please let Beel present a speculative hypothesis. The slippery dick is known to drag its tail behind while swimming (see the figure above), in which orientation the fish looks like a limp dick.\nThe slippery dick feeds on benthic invertebrates, including crabs, sea urchins and ophiuroids, polychaetes, and gastropods. Yummy. It is a protogynous hermaphrodite. Slippery dicks are born as females, but then change sex and become males.\nExcept, perhaps, from other members of its own species, the slippery dick gets no love. For example, the American Fisheries Society, that fishery machine of political correctness, saw fit to change the names of various species of \"squawfish\" to \"pikeminnow\" to prevent any possible insult to native Americans.\nBeel believes the slippery dick also deserves a classier name. Slippery dick sounds more like a former president or a venereal disease than a fish. What do you think? Should the American Fisheries Society be petitioned to change its name- but to what?\nBeel likes \"slippery Johnson.\" A name a little less penile in implication, but which still honors a former president. Alternatively, Beel could support the unimaginative \"slippery wrasse,\" which is pretty inocuous.\nPlease share your thoughts. If Beel can get some agreement on this, Beel will petition the mighty American Fisheries Society to do right by the slippery dick.\n\nQuestion: Is the slippery dick named after former President Richard Nixon? Answer: No, it is not\n\nQuestion: What is the common name of the fish being discussed in the text? Answer: Slippery dick\n\nQuestion: What does the slippery dick primarily feed on?

Place the chisel next to the brick or stone and angle it toward the center of the joint before striking it with the hammer. Clear the area to a depth at least twice that of the mortar joint width. Brush away any loose material before proceeding.\nStep 2: Mix clean, potable water into the dry mortar mix. Avoid chemical additives when repointing. Mix mortar in small batches, mixing only what can be used in half an hour. Mix mortar to a thick, butter-like consistency that smooths nicely when the bottom of a trowel is run over it. For most projects a premixed Type N mortar, which is typically one part Portland cement, one part hydrated lime and six parts sand, will work fine. Be aware that using cement-based mortar on older structures will cause irreparable damage. If the structure is over 75 years old, consult a preservation specialist to determine the correct mortar mixture.\nStep 3: Mist the brick or stone area to be repointed. Place a lump of prepared mortar on a plastering hawk or on the bottom of a flat trowel. Place the edge of the hawk or trowel against the brick or stone edge. Use a narrow tuck-pointing trowel to press a thin layer of mortar into the joint. Fill the joint with one quarter inch of mortar at a time. Press it firmly into the joint and mist the area as needed to keep it moist but not wet.\nStep 4: Once the joint is filled flush with the brick or stone surface, allow it to set until a print is formed when a thumb is pressed into the mortar. This process may take anywhere from 30 minutes to 24 hours.\nStep 5: When the mortar is firm enough, use a jointing tool or dowel rod to rub the surface to smooth it to a shine. Lightly brush the surface with a stiff bristle brush to give the new mortar a weathered look.\nStep 6: Wipe away any excess mortar from the brick or stone area and clean all tools immediately with cold water. Keep the mortar joints moist for at least a day to facilitate curing and reduce shrinking.\n— Have a home improvement question for Fix-It Chick?

{"text": "Latest News & Blogs\nDear Aby #2\nThe Question of Origin asks, \"How did life begin?\" and \"How did the universe and mankind come into existence? The Christian worldview holds the belief that every existing thing, including humans, is the result of a personal God and Creator.\nA secular humanistic worldview rejects any thought of God and denies His existence. It says we are the product of random acts of nature with no real purpose.\nA Christian worldview, on the other hand says, we are God's creation, designed to govern the world and fellowship with Him. ( Genesis 1:27-28; 2:15)\nThe issue of origin affects how a person understands identity and human value. The question of identity seeks to answer, \"What does it mean to be human?\" and \"Are humans more important than animals?\"\nThe Christian worldview holds the belief that mankind is a special creation of God who has created the human race above the animal kingdom with the responsibility of ruling over the animals and taking care of them. In contrast, the Secular Humanism worldview does not consider humans greater in value than animals because they are viewed to come from the same species. Their belief is that only through evolution have humans become more sophisticated animals.\nSecular Humanists believe that there is no God, that science and the scientific process have made God obsolete. Humanists believe that only matter – things we can touch, feel, prove, or study – exists and has always existed. A human being is only matter (no soul or spirit). No supernatural explanation is needed for the existence of this matter.\nThe Christian worldview affirms of the existence of an intelligent, powerful, loving, just, and awesome God who exists in the Trinity of Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. From the Christian perspective, \"In the beginning God\" (Genesis 1:2) is the foundation for all meaning.\nThe Christian worldview sees every human being as intrinsically valuable because each person has been created in the likeness and image of God. Each person has been formed by God and is a unique, priceless \"masterpiece.\" God \"breathed\" into the first human the breath of life and created humans with a soul and spirit. Thus, as opposed to animals, humans have the capacity to have a relationship with God.\nThere is obviously much more that can be said about the question of origin, but I want to keep my message short, so that's it for now\n\nQuestion: According to the Christian worldview, what is the purpose of mankind?

If given in 30 minutes, the chance of full recovery can be as high as 90 per cent. But this falls to around 50 per cent three hours later.\nHaemorrhagic strokes are treated with drugs that allow the blood to clot — so it's critical the type is determined quickly to allow effective treatment. Currently this involves a CT or MRI scan in hospital, which can take hours, losing precious time.\nThe new test, on trial at University Hospitals Coventry and Warwickshire NHS Trust, University Hospitals of North Midlands NHS Trust, and Salford Royal NHS Foundation Trust, detects levels of purines following research that has shown there is a surge in these after ischaemic stroke.\nAsk the pharmacist\nQ What can you do about chickenpox spots?\nA There are a number of products now available to treat chickenpox spots, including inexpensive calamine lotion, says Anshu Bhimbat of LloydsPharmacy in Buckinghamshire.\nChickenpox spots are itchy because reactions in the body make them acidic. The alkaline formulation of calamine lotion means that it neutralises spots, making them less itchy.\nThis is important because if you scratch spots they can become infected and scar.\nCalamine lotion also contains zinc oxide which is beneficial for the spots because of its antiseptic properties.\nRemember to keep nails short and clean to prevent infection, and make sure that you stay hydrated as the skin can easily become dry.\nYou can also relieve the itching and scratching with emollient (moisturising) creams or by using oral antihistamines.\nIf a stroke is suspected, a finger-prick drop of blood from the patient is added to a disposable strip, the size of an ice lolly stick. This is inserted into a hand-held reader which displays purine levels within three to five minutes.\nEarly results from the trial show much higher levels in ischaemic stroke patients compared to healthy people. They also show that the higher the level, the greater the amount of brain tissue affected by the stroke. These results can be used to guide treatment.\n\nQuestion: What is the chance of full recovery if clot-busting drugs are given within 30 minutes of an ischaemic stroke?

{"text": "Our Program\nAs previously stated, it is the philosophy of Wee care Preschool that early childhood should be a time of fun, warmth, security, exploring and discovery. Preschool children are creative and receptive, the staff strives to nurture and encourage these qualities in the children who attend this preschool. The purpose of the preschool is to provide an atmosphere that encourages social, emotional, physical and intellectual growth and develop the child as a whole. Planned within the framework of this philosophy and purpose, Wee Care Preschool's curriculum includes sharing and conversation time, stories, songs, finger plays, creative art activities, games, large muscle activities, field trips throughout the community, food preparation, science and nature activities, exposure to shapes, colors, numbers, letters and celebration of birthdays and holidays. A complete Wee Care Program Plan is on file at the school and may be obtained at any time by the parent.\nField trips\nWritten permission is necessary for your child to participate in field trips. In accordance with state law, children are required to be transported with seat belts and seated in booster seats. Children who are three years old must be transported in an approved safety seat provided by the parents.\nSnacks\nSnacks are served at each session. They consist of fruits, crackers, bread, peanut butter, etc. 100% juice and 2% milk are also served. An effort is made to provide nutritious snacks for the children. Snacks are also store bought items and stored and kept according to proper specifications.\nBirthdays\nThese are special days. Please talk to your child's teacher to arrange a special plan for bringing goody bags from your child if you so choose. Birthday treats from home planned for snack will NOT be an option unless specified by your individual teacher. Instead, we prefer birthday goody bags for the children to bring home in the place of a sugary snack at snack time. This individual attention continues to develop a positive self-image in the children. Summer birthdays are celebrated at the end of the school year in May or on the \"half birthdays\" according to the teacher's preference.\nTransportation and Carpooling\nTransportation is provided or arranged for by the parent. Parents frequently form carpools. The staff will be glad to assist you. A list of names and addresses of children who are in your child's class will be available at the beginning of school to help you in establishing carpools. Please inform the teacher of carpooling arrangements.\nSchool Cancellation\nSchool cancellation will be announced on the Marshall radio stations. If Marshall schools are closed for bad weather, Wee Care will also be closed. If Marshall schools have a 2 hour delayed start, Wee Care classes in the morning session will run from 10:00-12:00pm and the afternoon classes will remain the same. If schools have a 1 hour delayed start, all Wee Care morning sessions will run from 9:00-11:00am. Please check school closings before sending your child on snow mornings and afternoons.\nAbsenteeism\n\nQuestion: What are some activities included in Wee Care Preschool's curriculum?

This eighth edition has been revised and updated, including some beautiful new plates.\nProduct description\nBook Description\nThe most comprehensive one-volume book of identification that shows all Australian bird species.\nAbout the Author\nNicolas Day (Author) Nicolas Day was born in Surrey, England, and came to Australia at the age of ten. His interest in natural history and drawing has seen him conducting art classes around Australia, and his artwork has featured in Field Guide to the Birds of the ACT (with McComas Taylor, 1993) and Birds of the Solomons, Vanuatu and New Caledonia (with Chris Doughty and Andrew Plant, 2000). He was the natural history artist for the 1997 Raine Island expedition and has been on field trips to the Outer Hebrides and Macquarie Island in the subantarctic. He is currently an illustrator for the multi-volume work Handbook of Australian, New Zealand and Antarctic Birds. Nicolas regularly contributes illustrations for publication, and works to commission.\nKen Simpson (Author) Ken Simpson was educated at University High School, Victoria, and has had a life-long interest in natural history. His career as a Research Technician in several institutions later led to a position as Lecturer in Primary Science at Deakin University. He is the author of Birds in Bass Strait (1972) and co-author of Birdwatching in Australia and New Zealand (with Zoe Wilson, 1998). Ken is a Past President and Honorary Life Member of the Bird Observers Club of Australia, the recipient of the Honorary degree, Master of Science, from Monash University (1974) and the Australian Natural History Medallion (1996).\nPurchased this version back in 2013.

Am able to pick the birds by flicking through pages. Sometimes my friends need to point me in the right direction but that is because I am not patient enough to learn how to identify properly.\nThis Field Guide to the Birds of Australia is a very good beginners book for identifying native birds. The text is clearly written and the illustrations are accurate.

Infographics are particularly a great way to\nshow the interaction or relationship between different sets of data or easily\ndigest multiple sets of data.\nYou can build\ninfographics in PowerPoint yourself, or you can just take advantage of the\ninfographics template. Wait, that's not\nright. It's not one template, but a\nwhole library of infographics templates!\nTemplates\nLike all the templates in PowerPoint, you find\nthem by creating a new PowerPoint. Templates are one of the options that are\nsuggested.\nYou can also search\nfor infographics in the search field.\nThere are currently 50 templates available.\nWhen you click on\nany of them, a window pops up with a description of that infographic.\nFocus on your CONTENT\nAll the slides are customizable- just enter your data, your numbers, your labels, your information, into the graphics for the slide you choose. The heavy lifting of the design is already done for you, so you can just focus on the content. Microsoft started focusing on that concept when they introduced Sway, which really helps students focus on content by using AI to do most of the design work. Now they have been bringing that same intentionality into PowerPoint. Whether it's using a template, or the Quick Starter, they are helping students (and presenters) give all their attention to their content by nearly automating the design process. Just point PowerPoint in the right direction, feed it your message, and PowerPoint will help you deliver it well.\nAll of this applies to these infographics. You bring your loads of data and information, browse through the templates, customize the content and the theme, and you're ready to share, or present.\nOh, and even though\neach sample necessarily comers in a specific theme, you can still choose a\ncolor theme at any time to match the rest of your presentation.\nYou shouldn't need\nto purchase separate software or a subscription to an additional website to\nmake awesome infographics. You shouldn't\nneed to take a class just to learn how to make them either.\n\nQuestion: What is the main advantage of using infographic templates in PowerPoint? Answer: It allows users to focus on their content rather than the design process.\n\nQuestion: Which software is mentioned as an easy tool for creating infographics?

Initially, they thought he was crazy, but as the wine started to achieve fame outside the region, people realized that he had been a visionary all along. Aspiring growers began to seek his advice in both farming and winemaking.

He is farming single vineyards which demonstrate that site is multidimensional here in the same way that it is in all great wine growing regions of the world.

Enjoy the varied stops the transit system made as it grew along with the city, from the early horsecars of the Denver Horse Railroad Company and the steam-powered Colfax Avenue Railway to the running cable cars of the Denver Tramway and the electric trolleys of the South Denver Cable Railway Company. Though the last of the city's streetcars were pulled from service in the 1950s, Denver continues to expand its modern public transportation system with today's growing Light Rail. Join Denver historian Kevin Pharris on a tour of the city's glorious transit past as well as the modern improvements that are getting people onto the rails once again.\nAbout the author: Kevin Pharris reached Denver relatively late in life, owing to his being a military brat. Once settled in Denver, he found the history, the dichotomy of historic versus modern and the vitality of the city s drive toward the future very compelling. These elements beguiled him out of the world of English as a Second Language teaching and into that of history as a profession. Living in one of the city's first streetcar suburbs, the Whittier neighborhood, he has chosen to remain carless. For more than seventeen years, he has walked, ridden his bike, taken the train or bus and (to be entirely fair) occasionally had rides from friends in order to get here and there. Being carless turned him on to the transit history of the city. Denver's bold move to restore multimodal transit to the area inspired him to examine a present and future that serve as complements to the past. He'll remain carless for now, thrilled to ride the rails into the future along with the rest of those lucky few who call Denver home\n\nQuestion: What was the name of the first streetcar company in Denver?

This can be expressed as a single number, a range of numbers, greater than or less than, or something in relationship to a previous value opinion or numerical benchmark.

{"text": "Answers\nBest Answer: Ethiopia\nOVERVIEW\nThough it is making progress, Ethiopia remains one of the poorest countries in the world, with one in four Ethiopians living on less than $1 per day. USAID's main objective in Ethiopia is to overcome the country's near-constant state of food insecurity. Natural disasters, extreme poverty and underdevelopment, poor water and land management, and inadequate access to health care, education, and economic opportunity are the main causes of underdevelopment. USAID's work in Ethiopia improves disaster prediction and response management, economic growth, governance structures, and the quality of health care and education.\nPROGRAMS\nPEACE AND SECURITY\nRegional stability in the Horn of Africa is inextricably linked to internal stability in Ethiopia. Extremist influences, increasing inter-religious tension and increased insurgent and counter-insurgent operations in Somali Regional State, increase the risk of conflict and instability in Ethiopia. USAID supports conflict mitigation and reconciliation efforts, including advisory, facilitation, mediation, negotiation, and problem solving activities that support government and civil society stakeholders in high-tension and violence-prone areas. In 2008, USAID funded the South Omo Peace Concert, which brought together 17 ethnic groups and celebrated and cemented efforts to promote joint water resource, rangeland, and pasture management around South Omo National Park.\nGOVERNING JUSTLY AND DEMOCRATICALLY\nIn Ethiopia, USAID strengthens the capacity and role of civil society, improves independent human rights monitoring, investigation, and reporting, and works to improve the respect the judiciary and police have for international, national, and institutional human rights regulations. USAID also strengthens the federal and regional parliaments operating in the new, multiparty environment, and builds the capacity of national and regional judicial training centers and select law schools.\nINVESTING IN PEOPLE: HEALTH\nInadequate health care is a key impediment to Ethiopia's development. USAID is supporting the Government of Ethiopia's Health Sector Development Plan, which is seeking to train and deploy 30,000 community-based health extension workers by early 2009. The workers will provide primary health services, creating a continuum of quality care from health centers to health posts and communities. USAID also implements the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief and the President's Malaria Initiative and promotes synergies between these and other USAID programs.\nINVESTING IN PEOPLE: EDUCATION\nThrough the Africa Education Initiative and other programs, USAID improves the quality and equity of primary education by training teachers and administrators, strengthening planning, management, and monitoring and evaluation systems, and fostering community partnerships and school governance by building the capacity of parent-teacher associations and school grant management. Scholarship support also encourages girls and HIV/AIDS orphans to attend, and succeed in, school.\nECONOMIC GROWTH\n\nQuestion: What is the Africa Education Initiative aiming to achieve in Ethiopia?

They do it deliberately to weed out the quitters. Not all big name grad programs are like this but I know of a few that most certainly are. So do your research. Speak to people who have already been through your targeted grad programs. Ask about the work conditions etc.\nMy advice is apply for them all if they sound interesting to you. Pick the one that you think will most benefit your skills and make you excited to go to work each day. Do your research and ask current and former grads there what it's like to work there.

Here, it's just the way business is done.\nIn terms of electricity, here is how I understand it:\nThe customer is billed every two months.\nA physical bill is sometimes, not always, dropped off at the home/condo/apt. (I don't know how the bill gets to the home.)\nThe bill will be dropped off wherever: in a door, on a car, on a meter. Who knows. It's like a scavenger hunt.\nThe physical bill, when you get it - is usually on average 2-3 days late. So, if you wait for your bill, it's too late. No A/C for you.\nIf you just move into a house, you don't know what your meter # is, therefore you can't get online to check your bill. Instead, you have to wait for the first bill before you can know where you stand. (I.e. you have to have your electricity turned off at least once.)\nIn order to get the electricity back on, you must go down to the electric company to pay your bill. Or in my case, beg someone else (thank you so much D!) to do it for you.\nAfter you pay, your electricity may or may not be on that day. Depends on if someone can get to your house to turn it back on.\nMy thoughts:\nIf there was an actual MAILING system in Cabo, life would be easier.\nThank goodness from here on out I can go directly to the website to pay my bill.\nThis country is not very proactive. Instead, they're re-active. Instead of getting bills out on time, in a central location, so that they could get paid on time, they get them out late, send workers out to turn of electricity, then send workers out to turn back on electricity. Huh? Wouldn't work better for the company to just get the bills out and paid? No turnign on and off all the time?\nUtility billing here is odd. I got my water bill yesterday. On the hood of my car. I actually got two. For the same meter. With two different totals. Again, huh?\nThey don't put bills in envelopes here. Nope, just a bill. Open.\nNo utilities are in the renters' names. They're only in the name of the owner. Interesting.\nMoral of the story: don't take your envelopes for granted, the U.S. postal system for granted, or the fact that you speak the language for granted.\n1 comments:\nIf they did the proper way of billing there would be a lot of electric men/women out of work...this way they keep people employed and in country b/c the employment prevents them from crossing the border to get fruit picking jobs. I know this is harsh, but it's reality.\n\nQuestion: What is one improvement the author suggests to make utility billing more efficient?

{"text": "terms of a launch vehicle and a spacecraft. The launch vehicle supplies sufficient velocity to the spacecraft to enable it to coast over a long time period to its encounter with the distant planet. The launch vehicle usually consists of several stages, and the spacecraft is carried by the final stage within a nose fairing that protects it on its passage through the Earth's atmosphere. Once the spacecraft has been injected into a coasting trajectory, it can make minor course corrections by burning propellant in its velocity-control rocket engine. It does not generally make large changes in its velocity en route, although if it is to orbit a planet it must decrease its velocity by a substantial amount when it arrives in the planet's vicinity. With this outer planets mission, however, the old distinction between launch vehicle and spacecraft becomes blurred. The launch vehicle, which consists of a Titan IIIE first stage and a Centaur D-IT upper stage, is not capable by itself of imparting enough energy to inject a Voyager spacecraft into a Jupiter trajectory. The final increment of launch velocity is provided by a solid-propellant rocket that constitutes the Propulsion Module of the spacecraft. The part of the spacecraft that makes the entire journey (i.e., the Voyager) is the Mission Module. This arrangement provides advantages in performance and reliability through the use of the Mission Module's guidance and control electronics and propellant to stabilize the composite spacecraft's attitude during the one-time operation of the Propulsion Module. The Propulsion Module is shown as part of the spacecraft in figure 7. The total mass of the composite spacecraft is 2016 kg. Shortly after the burnout of the solid rocket, the Propulsion Module is jettisoned, and the 792-kg Voyager is on its way to Jupiter.

{"text": "Einstein's general relativity theory is questioned but still stands for now, team reports\nMore than 100 years after Albert Einstein published his iconic theory of general relativity, it is beginning to fray at the edges, said Andrea Ghez, UCLA professor of physics and astronomy. Now, in the most comprehensive test of general relativity near the monstrous black hole at the center of our galaxy, Ghez and her research team report July 25 in the journal Science that Einstein's theory of general relativity holds up.\n\"Einstein's right, at least for now,\" said Ghez, a co-lead author of the research. \"We can absolutely rule out Newton's law of gravity. Our observations are consistent with Einstein's theory of general relativity. However, his theory is definitely showing vulnerability. It cannot fully explain gravity inside a black hole, and at some point we will need to move beyond Einstein's theory to a more comprehensive theory of gravity that explains what a black hole is.\"\nEinstein's 1915 theory of general relativity holds that what we perceive as the force of gravity arises from the curvature of space and time. The scientist proposed that objects such as the sun and the Earth change this geometry. Einstein's theory is the best description of how gravity works, said Ghez, whose UCLA-led team of astronomers has made direct measurements of the phenomenon near a supermassive black hole -- research Ghez describes as \"extreme astrophysics.\"\nThe laws of physics, including gravity, should be valid everywhere in the universe, said Ghez, who added that her research team is one of only two groups in the world to watch a star known as S0-2 make a complete orbit in three dimensions around the supermassive black hole at the center of the Milky Way. The full orbit takes 16 years, and the black hole's mass is about four million times that of the sun.\nThe researchers say their work is the most detailed study ever conducted into the supermassive black hole and Einstein's theory of general relativity.\nThe key data in the research were spectra that Ghez's team analyzed this April, May and September as her \"favorite star\" made its closest approach to the enormous black hole. Spectra, which Ghez described as the \"rainbow of light\" from stars, show the intensity of light and offer important information about the star from which the light travels. Spectra also show the composition of the star. These data were combined with measurements Ghez and her team have made over the last 24 years.\nSpectra -- collected at the W.M. Keck Observatory in Hawaii using a spectrograph built at UCLA by a team led by colleague James Larkin -- provide the third dimension, revealing the star's motion at a level of precision not previously attained.

{"text": "1 | Explore his language\nAbout a thousand words that we use today are first recorded in Shakespeare's poems and plays. Often he was simply the first to write them down, but he also invented words to express the meaning he had in his head.\nSome of the words first found in Shakespeare include 'fairyland' (A Midsummer Night's Dream), 'amazing' (Richard II) and 'squander' (The Merchant of Venice).\nLanguage is constantly changing and children can learn a lot from discovering how Shakespeare used words creatively.\nSome of Shakespeare's devices for making new words included adding a prefix such as 'un-', meaning 'not', as in 'uncomfortable'. He also added suffixes such as '-less', meaning 'without', as in 'noiseless'.\nChallenge pupils to use a prefix or suffix in new ways to create words. For example, which words could they create if someone took away their bike ('unbiked' or 'bikeless')?\nChildren can become Will's Word Warriors by completing a booklet full of language and grammar activities, linked to Shakespeare's language. The booklet was written by expert linguist Professor David Crystal and is free to download on the Shakespeare Week website.\n2 | Take a virtual tour\nIn the video, mini Tudor guides escort pupils on a tour of the house that Shakespeare grew up in, explaining what life was like for a Tudor child.\nAs they journey through the house, pupils will find out the answers to intriguing questions such as why Shakespeare's garden was smelly, why there was a bed in the parlour and what a horse was doing in the house!\n3 | Pounce a portrait\nNowadays if we want to make a copy of something we can simply photocopy or scan it. In Tudor times, the technique for reproducing a picture was called 'pouncing' and can easily be recreated by children to good effect.\nFind a simple image of William Shakespeare (find a portrait in the Shakespeare Week resources) and place a sheet of tracing paper underneath the image, secured with paper clips.\nRest the image and tracing paper on a piece of foam then prick through the lines of the image with a tapestry needle or awl. Place the pricked tracing paper onto a clean sheet of paper and rub charcoal through the holes.\nRemove the tracing paper and blow away the excess charcoal to create a dot-to-dot image which you can join up to make an outline. Add colour with chalk pastels or paints.\n4 | Create a soundscape\nInvite pupils to stand in a large circle and explain that they are going to create a soundscape using body percussion and their voices. Pick a theme from a Shakespeare play, such as the storm from The Tempest.\nAsk the children what sounds they might hear, such as waves crashing, sails tearing and sailors howling.\nTry out each suggested sound then, while remaining in the circle, divide the children into small groups, giving each group a sound. Explain that you will be a conductor and agree on signals for stopping and starting the sounds and making them quieter and louder.\n\nQuestion: Which play is the storm soundscape from? Answer: The Tempest\n\nQuestion: What does the suffix '-less' mean?

In the Free Planets Alliance, The names of planets and systems originate from Arabic (Ba'alat, Masjid), and Sanskrit(Urvashi, Amritsar, Gandharva), and many characters have African, South Asian, East Asian, and European heritage.\nThe Politics\nLegend of Galactic Heroes is often praised for its political themes. The show goes into detail about several traits and flaws in both liberal democracies and feudal empires. The war includes phases such as occupation, guerilla warfare, and large scale space battles evoking 18th-century naval line battles.\nAs a progressive liberal, My lot falls with the Free Planets Alliance. The show often criticizes jingoism and political corruption in a democracy. One of the antagonistic groups in Alliance the is a patriotic militia who often target dissenters and those not considered \"patriotic enough\", echoing the rise of the far right American \"Patriot\" groups such as the Three Percenters and Oathkeepers.\n(It should be mentioned that while the show has enough content to make allusions to current day politics, the show doesn't intend to predict events, but to comment on the cyclic nature of history. The intro in the second season shows text that reads \"In every Age, In every Place, The Deeds of Men Remain the Same\" )\nSome of the politics in the show has been criticized by Rob Hutton on Medium. The author argues that Legend of Galactic Heroes justifies \"enlightened\" authoritarianism, military rule and conservatism.\nThe show also tends to idealize Reinhard's noble ambitions. Scenes that occur during his rise to power also uncomfortably evoke the rise of fascism, including cries of \"Heil\".\nThe show falls mostly in the liberal-centrist political camp. Viewers who expect a Marxist analysis of history and economics will be disappointed. Little is said about the means of production or analysis of economic class in the Alliance, or Fezzan. The analysis of class in the Empire mostly focuses on challenging the feudalist class structure from the top down.\nThe dilemma of flawed democracy or an enlightened dictatorship is given more balance than Hutton gives the show credit for. In Episode 31, Yang undergoes an inquiry by Alliance politicians about statements he made against nation-states, suggesting that Yang has anarchist sentiments. Yang also leads a faction opposing a military coup-de-etat of the Alliance instigated by Reinhard and Fezzan. During the El Facil Revolutionary Government arc later in the series, also Yang insists on the necessity of civilian rule in the new breakaway state that offers him executive power.\nSince the original light novel author Yoshiki Tanaka is from Japan, a country that has experienced liberal democracy, feudal states, and authoritarian dictatorships, the show reflects a more holistic political view.\n\nQuestion: Which political ideologies are criticized in the show, according to Rob Hutton?

{"text": "The rubber caps on the Vita are helpful but they degrade like most rubberized plastics, I've noticed. I've also discovered that they are WAY too sensitive for some games (I.E. PSP Wing Commander played on the Vita is unplayable because the Analogue stick is way too sensitive and there is no way to change inputs).\nThe Vita is amazing hardware (as was the PSP when it came out), but I think in their rabid hate for hacking and homebrewing they tried to lock it down so much that it made it impractical for most developers, amid cost. Sony has a massive bad habit of producing some really cool technology and then charging entirely too much for licensing to third parties to use or develop for it. That's one of the major reasons the PSP and the UMD died (After all, piracy wasn't a problem until -after- Sony had decided to terminate it) and the Vita was not much different.\nMost of the time, they sell these consoles at almost a loss or as close to a loss as they can in hopes of making up sales on software, but you can't pirate what doesn't exist. So claims of 'piracy' being the reason the PSP and the Vita died are bogus at best. It was really Sony's incapability of reasonable licensing that does it.

{"text": "Can You Be Jailed If You Owe a Bank Money and Do Not Pay?\nOn the federal level, the U.S. government made it illegal in the 1800s to imprison someone just because they couldn't repay a debt. However, more and more often, courts in some states are jailing individuals who fail to repay a creditor when they are court ordered to do so.\nThe aforementioned practice is not widespread. Under the Fair Debt Collection Practice Act, debtors who do not pay civil debts (like to a bank or other company) should not be imprisoned, and creditors and debt collectors are specifically forbidden from threatening debtors with jail time. Nonetheless, willful failure to pay debts to the government (such as taxes) can land you in prison. It's worth noting that some of the signatories on the Declaration of Independence spent some time in now defunct debtor's prisons.\n\nQuestion: Are there any states where people are currently being imprisoned for failing to repay a court-ordered debt?

{"text": "Self Help Information\nSelf Treatment of Common Illnesses and Accidents\nMany common aches and pains can be simply treated at home without the need to consult a doctor.\nBack Pain\nMost people will have low back pain at some time in their lives, and the vast majority will recover with little or no treatment within six weeks. Usually arising from the discs, joints of the spine, muscles or ligaments, the pain is described as 'mechanical'. This type of pain is commonest between the ages of 20 and 50. Pain spreading to the foot or toes is sciatica and merits seeing your doctor if not resolving in a few days. Current advice is to keep going and continue normal daily activities including work, as rest may actually prolong back pain. Use simple pain killers such as paracetamol or ibuprofen.\nYou should seek medical attention if any of the following occur:\nThe pain lasts more than 6 weeks\nWeakness of legs\nNumbness in the groin or buttocks\nLoss of control of bladder or bowels\nAching pain at night disturbing sleep\nYou have fever, sweating or chills\nBurns\nFor minor burns, hold the affected area under cold water for at least 10 minutes or until the pain subsides. Remove jewellery etc. and cover the burn with clean, non-fluffy material to protect from infection. Cloth, a clean plastic bag or kitchen film all make good dressings. If a minor burn is larger than a postage stamp it requires medical attention. All deep burns of any size require urgent hospital treatment. On all burns:\nDo not use lotions, ointments and creams\nDo not use adhesive dressings\nDo not break blisters\nColds\nEven in this day and age there is still no magic cure for the common cold. Go to bed, take plenty of drinks. It is probably best to stay at home to avoid spreading your cold to others. Take it easy and rest if possible. Keep warm, and keep the atmosphere moist. Drink plenty of fluids, as you will lose a lot through mucus production and possibly perspiration. Avoid smoking if possible, as it will further irritate the throat and the lining of the nose. Take aspirin or paracetamol as per the dosage.\nNosebleeds\nIf you are having a nosebleed you should: Sit down and firmly pinch the soft part of your nasal cavity, just above your nostrils, together for 10 minutes, lean forward and breathe through your mouth leaning forward drains the blood down your nose instead of down the back of your throat, maintain the pressure on your nose for 15 minutes (time this on the clock) in order for the blood to clot, place a covered ice pack on your cheek to help soothe the area, the bleeding should stop and not start again, unless your nose is knocked or picked, and avoid blowing your nose and strenuous activity for at least 12 hours after a nosebleed. Avoid hot drinks for a few hours after that. Try also not to wipe your nose too much, or to sneeze. If the bleeding persists, consult your doctor.\nSunburn\n\nQuestion: What should you do if you have back pain that spreads to the foot or toes (sciatica) that doesn't resolve in a few days?

This has led to the call for its integration into the educational system of health training schools in Ghana. The researchers studied health trainees' perception on the effects smartphone usage has on their attitudes towards learning. This study was grounded on the views of constructivist theory of learning. A descriptive cross sectional study design was adopted. Among 614 health trainees studying various medical and allied health courses at the College of Health-Yamfo of Ghana, 138 students were selected using both stratified and systematic sampling methods. Descriptive statistics was used to analyse the data. The outcome of the study indicated that health trainees who use smartphones in their learning activities develop positive attitude towards learning (76%). However, it was revealed that health trainees who do not use smartphones in their learning activities had negative attitude towards learning (57%). They were also not confident; did not complete assignments; depended on others during studies and did not have access to large volume of information via the internet. Finally, chatting through WhatsApp and other social media applications during lectures and small screen size were barriers to effective use of smartphone in learning activities.

{"text": "Month: September 2019\nToday is September 13, 2019, Friday. You must have read in my earlier blog about 'Triskaidekaphobia' the fear of number 13 (from Greek tris ('three'), kai ('and'), and deka ('ten'), and 'Paraskevidekatriaphobia' is the term used to describe the fear of 'Friday the thirteenth' – (Greek words paraskevi ('Friday') and dekatria ('thirteen') with –phobia as a suffix to indicate 'fear').\nThere is another astronomical significance for this Friday the 13th – it coincided with Full Moon. Last time a full moon appeared on Friday the 13th was in October of 2000. This Full Moon is also called a 'micro-moon' because it is at its farthest point from Earth – also known as its apogee. Being at the farthest point, the moon appeared around 14% smaller than usual and much dimmer than a normal Full Moon.\nAs this Full Moon fell immediately before Fall Equinox, It is called a Harvest Moon.\nThe term 'Equinox' comes from Latin meaning 'equality of night and day.' It occurs twice in a year – one in Spring (22 March) and one in Fall (22 September), that is when the Sun crosses the celestial equator, causing day and night to be of 12 hours each. In Canada, Fall Equinox marks the beginning of Fall season.\n'Harvest Moon' is an old European term applied to a full moon that rises closest to the beginning of fall. In the earlier days when the farmers could not illuminate their farmland, the bright light of the moon facilitated farmers to work a little later into the night to bring in their crops well before Fall set in.\nAs if to facilitate harvest, the harvest moon rises 10 to 30 minutes after the sun sets, whereas most moons rise approximately 50 minutes after sunset. In Toronto, on September 13, the sun did set at 7:31 PM and the moon rose at 7:46 PM. This time gap between sunset and moon-rise was even shorter as one moved closer to the North Pole.\nOn the morning of June 22 we decided to explore the Tagus River front of Lisbon. We walked to the Vasco da Gama Garden on the Northern bank of Tagus River. The garden is a lovely green space situated in one of the noble areas of cosmopolitan Lisbon. The garden features a wave-shaped lake on the lower level of the garden and a fountain with waterspouts.\n\nQuestion: What is the time difference between sunset and moon-rise in Toronto on September 13, 2019?

In that exercise, we randomly selected 140 households in each site to answer questions about their agricultural practices, months of food shortage, sources of weather information and other topics that can serve as a basis for comparison when we revisit them in 5-10 years.\"\nInternational Development - Anne Heyman on making development projects sustainable: \"Everyone implementing projects in developing countries faces the challenge of ensuring their sustainability. Often these efforts focus on financial sustainability, but this is only part of the equation. Equally important is the question of operational sustainability: how can founders ensure that the project will continue at the expected level of program delivery even after they have left the country?\nThis question has been a critical component of strategic planning for the Agahozo-Shalom Youth Village in Rwanda since the project's inception in September 2006. Our focus on hiring and increasing the capacity of Rwandan staff has been more expensive, and this approach is more time-consuming at the outset than using already-trained staff from abroad. But it has been essential to making the project sustainable over the long term.\"\nThese risks emanate from the lack of capacity of these farmers to use financial products, he argued.\n\"It is like giving someone who doesn't know how to drive a car,\" Mwangi said. \"This is why is important to build capacity to the farmers, not just assume they have the intellectual capacity to use modern products when you are bringing them from what you could call subsistence farming and quickly you are pushing them into a modern financial sector.\"\"\nMuch of that new understanding has come from the FAO itself and from the World Agroforestry Centre (ICRAF), which has built up a body of research on issues such as the use of particular tree varieties and how they can improve soil quality, complement specific field crops, and generate new income streams for smallholders.\nFor example, one of the major potential benefits of on-farm trees is their ability to replenish nutrient-depleted soil, and the results of a 12-year study by ICRAF published in September 2012 showed how the planting of a particular tree variety – Gliricidia – as a fertiliser tree alongside maize improved the stability of harvests of this staple food crop in sub-Saharan Africa.\"\nInternational Development - A development researcher's best friend: \"\"Evaluation is a hot topic,\" said Louise Broadbent, co-founder and managing director of Surveybe, a data collection and research company. \"You can't implement any sort of development project these days unless you incorporate a baseline, a midline and an endline assessment.\"\n\nQuestion: How many households were randomly selected in each site for the CCAFS household baseline survey?

{"text": "The concept of cultural boundaries has become the continuously debated subject whether culture is conceived through geographical means, territorial, colonial or other phenomena occurring within the society. As per Bashkow's article and with the support of other researches (Clifford and Marcus 1986; Gupta and Fergason and Ferguson 1997), the concept of culture is conceived more as a constructs based on cultural representations (e.g. ethnographic monograph). The cultural representations are originated from the diverse social phenomena occurring within the society, which fuels the continuity and change in the prevailing culture. The cultural change and continuity is argued through the ideas of Evolutionists and Boasian anthropology. The principles of evolutionists emphasizes the development of culture in a universal, autonomous process of change, while Boasians argue that the social interpersonal relationships present are the main predisposing factor facilitating the cultural change. Bashkow's perspective inclines most of its reasoning towards the theoretical stand of Boasian's cultural boundaries. The ideas of Boasian theory on cultural boundaries are described in three conditions: the porous and permeable aspect of cultural development, the pluralization of cultural boundaries, and divergence between anthropological perspective and folk's boundaries with its \"zone of the foreign\" principle. In the first argument, culture in anthropological perspective is viewed as a porous and permeable material capable of acquiring cultural change and modification through the process of cultural diffusion. According to the Boasians, culture progress differently despite of the same cultures present in the social atmosphere. In Boasian's critique of evolutionism during the 19th century, the similarities on laws, rituals, artistic motifs, ideas, etc. are evidently not the most important precursors of cultural change, but rather the association and socialization between neighboring tribes (Boas 1896 quoted by Bashkow 2004). Culture is thus marked by an irreducible tension between the complementary process of diffusion and integration, which sums to the first condition of the theory. Secondly, the theory considers the pluralization of the term culture since the definitions of culture do not only consider the ecological conditions, livelihood, artistic heritages, social relations, and the individuals involves, but rather, it also gives consideration to the historical background of the tribe, influences of regions and the tribe's social circle. The aspect of cultural pluralization involves a multi-faceted definition of culture. Boasians consider the term people, culture, society and tribe defined under equivalent meanings. Lastly, the Boasians' principles argue against the concept of people's fold ideas in the concept of human nature and racial inheritance. Boasians believe that cultural development should be defined in the concept associating to cultural traits and merging of foreign influences.\nAbu-Abu-Lughod's Anthropological Culture\n\nQuestion: What are the main factors that cultural representations are originated from, according to the text?

{"text": "Gene Kelly embarks on a vendetta against the criminals who killed his father in Black Hand, his first dramatic outing.\nThe name \"Black Hand\" has been used by numerous secret societies over the years, from Spanish anarchists to Serbian unification groups. In the context of organized crime in America, it refers to a loosely-defined collective of lone wolves and gangs who preyed upon their fellow Italian-American immigrants in the early 1900s. It should be noted, however, that the Black Hand was not the name of a particular crime syndicate or anything like that. It was a signature that accompanied ransom and extortion demands, along with other violent imagery - firing guns, bloody knives, skulls, that sort of thing. At the end of these letters was the symbol of a hand drawn in black ink, making a gesture that represented a warning. A reporter for the New York Herald coined the phrase \"Black Hand letters,\" and the name stuck, eventually spawning the myth of an elaborate crime cartel. Black Hand gangsters didn't hesitate to use violence against cops, even assassinating policemen who got too close to their operations, such as Joseph Petrosino of the NYDP in 1909. Black Hand activity was sometimes used by politicians and the press to demonize Italian-American immigrants, even though they themselves were often the targets. (Sound familiar?) Famed opera tenor Enrico Caruso in particular was targeted multiple times, after paying a ransom the first time he received a Black Hand letter.\nA film based on the exploits of the Black Hand seemed inevitable, and MGM originally planned for such a film to be a B-picture starring Robert Taylor. However, Gene Kelly, who had returned to Hollywood in 1946 following his time in the US Naval Air Service, was looking for some substantial acting opportunities. Although his most iconic films, An American in Paris (1951) and Singin' in the Rain (1952) were yet to come, Kelly had already made a rep for himself as a talented dancer and choreographer on both the stage and the big screen. After a noteworthy performance in William Saroyan's Broadway hit The Time of Your Life in 1939, he got his first lead role in Pal Joey in 1940. Hollywood took notice, and Kelly made his film debut in For Me and My Gal (1942), opposite Judy Garland. Kelly was wowing audiences and impressing critics with his dancing prowess in hits such as Thousands Cheer (1943) - which also gave him his first chance to choreograph his own routines - Cover Girl (1944), and Anchors Aweigh (1945). While there's no denying Kelly's prowess as a dancer, I find myself personally more impressed with the creative ingenuity of his choreography, particularly when partnered with a mop (it makes sense in context) and Jerry from Tom & Jerry.​\nAnchors Aweigh (1945)\n\nQuestion: Who is the main character in the film 'Black Hand'?

In past years, the summit has been a forum to discuss issues pertinent to cyclists, connect with advocates from other cities and states, and discuss future goals. But when it comes to the ultimate goal of making roads safer for bicycles and reducing fatal accidents, the strategy has long been unclear. Will this year's National Bike Summit make a significant step toward reducing fatal bicycle accidents?\nConsumer Reports is absolutely killing it when it comes to distracted driving coverage. Last week, I reviewed their April edition, in which Secretary of Transportation Ray LaHood, a tireless advocate for stricter distracted driving laws, said he would use his clout to push for a nationwide anti-distracted driving law. Later in the week, the magazine's car blog profiled some groundbreaking youngsters leading the next generation of vehicle safety advocates. And today, the advocacy group's website will host LaHood in a conversation titled \"Distracted Driving Shatters Lives.\"\nLike drunk driving and wearing a seat belt, avoiding distracted driving is becoming more and more of a no brainer. The Department of Transportation has reported that there were 6,000 deaths and half a million injuries caused by distracted driving last year alone, making it the number one killer of teenagers. But as technology becomes more advanced, the temptation to text, email, or talk on the phone while driving becomes even more of a problem. In a major story for its April edition, Consumer Reports has targeted distracted driving, its major opponents, and listed ideas for what regular people can do to end it.\n\nQuestion: Who is the host of the annual National Bike Summit?

{"text": "Petite paws carried Lyra swiftly towards her target, amber oculi fixing upon the beautiful lepidopteran, mouth parting in awe. When the breeze stilled and the pup perked her ears forwards, the soft, scarcely audible flutter of the butterfly's wings reached the youth's audits, the coywolf stopping for a moment to appreciate the butterfly's beauty before continuing in her innocent pursuit yet again. She had no intention to catch the airborne elegance, but she indeed wanted to follow it, carefree bliss in her orange-hued eyes. Her mottled feet carried Lyra closer and closer to the winged insect, further and further from where she had started.\nWhilst she remained in acute awareness of her surroundings and the incoming sensory information, Lyra did not process the information intellectually, instead merely enjoying how the scents and sights danced around her, how the soft sound of the breeze tickled twin auds, how the various vegetation lying upon the ground stroked her paws. She smiled with content, a set of vivid amber orbs darting this way and that to take in the new territory that she had entered.\nThe forest provided relieving shade from the mid-spring sun beating down on Lyra, a minuscule maw pushing around at the dirt lining the ground with curiosity, with a pup-like desire to explore, to discover. However, she failed to look up, and failed to spot the dark form nearby, right in front of her. It was only when the young coywolf looked up that she sighted the green-eyed figure watching like a hawk, as if she might transform into something far more intimidating than a tiny pup and attack. At the realisation that this stranger did not smell of Airila, she began backing away.\nShe knew that there were hostile wolves outside of the pack—what if this was one of them? In fear, she dared not look the stranger in the eye, instead slowly shuffling away, limbs tensed in preparation for a potential attack. If it came to such an action, she would be ready to sprint away, although she was not sure if she could outpace a larger wolf, along with him being an adult. Although, he did seem to be missing a leg, so she remained unsure.

Cultural themes are considered important to be lifted because looking at the problems that occur today can not be separated from differences in viewpoint in understanding the culture itself. This is then done by a group of filmmakers who are members of Makkita Cinema Production's production house by making a film entitled Uang Panai 'Maha(R)L which raised the traditional culture as the main problem in the film.\nThe purpose of this research is to know the meaning of traditional cultural message in this Uang Panai 'Maha(R)L film, and to know the meaning of the message of culture presented in the film, the researcher uses qualitative interpretative type using semiotik Roland Barthes method. Here the sign will be interpreted with two levels of marking, denotation and connotation without overriding the existing myths to get a general and comprehensive picture and understanding of the problem under study.\nFrom the results of this study obtained the picture that the meaning of Bugis-Makassar cultural message is on: scene 2 about culture merantau which is interpreted as an effort to gain freedom and independence in order to meet complex needs. Scene 4 on trade culture is interpreted as work that has freedom in work so it is very appropriate for Bugis-Makassar society because it has a high work ethic.

{"text": "This is important because, in many cases, the evaluation of content is highly subjective and not suited to processing even by advanced AI techniques. Such crucial, subjective judgements might relate to financial, quality, research or progress decisions over large visual datasets. Key decisions can be made with more speed and more clarity when salient information has been extracted automatically from thousands or even millions of files.\nMachine learning is increasingly adept at classification tasks such as identifying objects, less tangible features such as sentiment or emotion, and much, much more. This makes it especially useful when enhancing existing databases or archives of content for which little or no structured information exists. The best part is that machine learning processes can be run 24×7, and can be upgraded to new and better machine learning models as they appear in the future.\nSo how can the tsunami of unstructured data be harnessed? ML is clearly a potent tool to this end. But to use ML effectively requires both an effectively trained model, and a means to explore the extracted data.

Some people have a mixture of causes that combine to give dementia.\nAbout 800,000 people in the UK have been diagnosed with dementia, though there are an unknown number of people with early symptoms that have not been diagnosed yet.\nDementia is gradually progressive, but the rate at which symptoms worsen varys from person to person; the degree that different symptoms present also varys.\nWhat are the common symptoms?\nMemory loss - this can be one of the first symptoms that people notice. The observations people report include - noticing their loved ones forgetting things that have happened earlier in the day, getting confused about messages and who people are, getting lost whilst out and about, repeating themselves, and appearing not to be paying attention or following conversations.\nProblems with communication - Some people experience problems with expressing themselves, talking and understanding things. They get confused about words and might use the wrong words for common things and mix words up. Reading and understanding written text can become problematic.\nI am concerned that I or someone I know might have dementia - what should I do?\nMake an appointment with a GP. You are welcome to bring someone with you to the appointment - in fact, coming with someone who knows you well can help us to make a diganosis.\nIn the first instance the GP will ask you some questions and do a screening test. In many instances, they will be able to reassure you. However, if there is still concern about the possibility of dementia they may examine you and take blood tests to rule out other conditions that make give similar symptoms but are reversible (for example, infections)\nIf treatable causes have been ruled out, your GP will probably refer you to a memory specialist.\nWhat help is available?\nFinding out that you or someone you know has dementia can be difficult.\nHaving support or someone to talk to can be very helpful. At the bottom of the page, we have listed some of the local and national support groups and services that you may wish to contact for support.\nSupport is also available for carers, these are detailed on our carer's page.\nWhat about medicine?\nMedicines can help slow the progression in some people.

{"text": "Why Are Older Dogs Cheaper than Puppies?\nby Jonni\nI recently saw an ad for an adult Cavalier King Charles Spaniel that was being sold for $250, when the only Cavalier puppies available in the area that week were being sold for $800 to $1200.\nCan you imagine a farmer selling a full-grown cow for a third of the price he charges for 2-week old calves? It's a silly idea – but most puppies often bring much higher prices than older dogs. The exceptions are dogs that have been raised and trained for a specific purpose, such as the specialized hunting dogs, sniffer dogs, and search and rescue dogs.\nMost dogs in the United States have only one purpose: To be pets. And for some reason, other people's pets lose value the longer they live with those other people.\nWhen most dog owners need to sell their adult dogs, you can bet they won't get the price they paid for them as puppies.\nLab and pit bull owners who need to \"re-home\" their pets have to beg folks to take them, or the dogs end up in the pound.\nI'm going to bring the discussion back to those specially-trained dogs for a moment. I suspect that the reason a mature working dog sells for big money and mature pets do not, is that Americans assume that other people's pets have been \"damaged\" somehow, through bad training or permissive ownership.\nAny dog that needs a new home, we believe, is \"somebody else's problem.\" Why would anyone pay extra for a dog who has been getting away with murder? (And we assume he has been, or he wouldn't be looking for a new home).\nMaybe if we had a dog training class in every high school, and we all learned how to raise civilized dogs, we would begin to assume that other people's dogs learn good habits as they mature.\nThen it would be easier to believe someone when she tells us that her \"active\" dog needs a new home (with a strong fence and no small children) because the owner has to move and can't take the dog with her. Perhaps older dogs, in other words, would begin to get the respect they deserve.\n\nQuestion: What do Lab and pit bull owners often have to do when they need to re-home their pets?

{"text": "When you set up 2FA, you'll be given a number of scratch codes. You can use one of these if you lose access to your 2FA app (e.g. if your phone or computer gets broken or stolen). You only see these codes while setting up 2FA (and never again), so copy them from your browser and save them offline in a safe place (e.g. on a memory stick or paper printout). If you don't keep these codes and encounter a problem with your 2FA device, you will be locked out of your account.\nEach scratch code can only be used one time, and it takes two of them to turn off 2FA (the first to log in without 2FA, and the second to shut off 2FA after logging in).\nDon't store these on your smartphone. If it gets lost, you won't be able to use your phone, and you'll lose the codes!\nYou still need to follow good security practices. Don't use your name, date of birth, or anything that can be guessed in a dictionary attack as a password. Don't write your password down in a place anyone else can see it, and consider whether or not it's a good idea to log in to your Wikipedia account on public terminals at schools, libraries, and airports.\nIf for some reason you need to use one or more scratch codes or feel that they have been compromised, you should generate a new set at your earliest convenience (especially if you are down to three or less remaining). To generate a new batch of scratch codes dis-enroll then re-enroll in two-factor authentication. This will void all of your old scratch codes and create a new batch.\nIf you are totally locked out, regaining access to your account will be very difficult and usually involve proving your identity beyond the shadow of a doubt to one of the developers via the Phabricator system who may or may not decide to manually disable 2FA in the database directly. If you cannot satisfy these requirements or the developers deny your request, it is impossible to turn 2FA off and you'll have to create a new account.\nWhen you log in, after entering your password, you'll be asked for a verification code.\nOpen your 2FA app and you should see a 6-digit verification code.\nType the verification code in as is (with no spaces), and you should be logged back in\nBecause the verification code is time-based, it may change while you're doing this, in which case you'll have to add the latest code instead. The application will normally indicate when a code is about to expire (e.g. in Google Authenticator, the code's colour changes from blue to red).\nIf you no longer want to use 2FA, go to Special:Manage Two-factor authentication and you'll be given the option to disable it. You'll need to enter a 6-digit verification code, just as you would when logging in.

Age alone will give us plaque growth (it's the body's natural healing response to the stress of 100,000 heartbeats a day). I don't care how good you look on the outside, you don't know your health on the inside until you look. Everybody ages. No one is immune.\nDiet and exercise are great ways to slow aging. Statin medications can also help slow or stop vascular aging.\nAlso, the older we get, the slower and more irregular our heart becomes. Young athletes have a slow heart because they are fit, but once we crest over the hill into our 60s, 70s, 80s, and beyond, our hearts will continue to slow because we are old, not because we are fit.\nIf your heart is beating zero times a minute, you are dead. If you're beating 20 times a minute, you're almost dead. If your beating 40 times a minute, either you're an Olympic athlete or you're old and not getting enough blood to the brain. Fix that. It's what pacemakers are for. I have seen many men go completely daft out of stubbornness (and not getting a pacemaker).\nWhat's more, the slower you are, the more likely you are to have atrial fibrillation.

When that happens, it starts to clot. When you cut yourself, a clot is good. When clots form inside our hearts, they have a tendency to travel to the brain.\nThat is exactly what a stroke is. The most common strokes are blood clots in the brain.\nWell, who allowed that to happen?\nAll heart and vascular health is knowable. Are you taking a Stoke Prevention Med? No? Do you know the health of your heart? Do you know the health of your arteries?

In the other one ofthe three he might make a mediocre success.\nEngineering specialization= design +calculation(use of head)\nTechnologist specialization= use of tools(use of hand)\nFrom the above, we can see that mechanical engineers don't build and repair stuff anymore as one does years ago. Instead, they draw plans and input it in a computer using basic computer aided design software such as solid works and auto cad. Such designs are sent to technologist for production. There is no automobile production plant in the country so automobile engineers are not utilized. The few designs end up in the journals wasted since no automobile plant to produce their design. We mainly import vehicles or their spare parts. Use of tools is the spec ialisation of a technologist. Hence, the average Nigerian expect an engineer to assemble or repair cars.\nILLUSTRATION There is need to design more fuel economy vehicle. An engineer applies scientific law.\nMassflow rate= velocity * area\nVelocity of automobile is determined by the driver, so he tries to alter the area of fuel delivery system to test if would have an effect on the quantity of fuel dissipated per unit time.. He applies differential calculus (calculation)to reduce the area of the fuel system. Next he draws his proposed shape on a paper(manually or using computer) and instruct the technologist to produce his new design. After it is produced, the system is testrun .\nFrom the above, engineers are creative thinkers who find ways to solve problem\nTechnologist are part of the family who execute engineers thought\nWithout the engineer, there would be no change or invention\nWithout the technologist, an engineer idea would remain on paper\nBoth need each other.\nIn most big factories, engineers are not expected to handle tools. Technologists are not expected to design . companies hire engineers to do design work and hire skilled labour to do skilled work.\nBut some engineers know how to do repairs. Yes, such kmowledge was not learnt in classroom. It was either learnt during industrial training days or before got admission to study engineering.

The man in front of me was talking loudly about thisandthat to the voice in his earpiece and a baby's scream bounced off the concrete façade. It was hot; almost ninety-two, and I could feel the sun slowly burning away the skin on my nose and my closed eyelids. I could almost hear my mother telling me how I should have put on sunblock like she always told me to do.\nI knelt down before the coffin and just kind of stared at the flag draped over it. I didn't know what else to do. I didn't even know why I showed up. But I just knelt there for a while, staring at the flag, then through the flag to the varnished wood, then through the wood to the ravaged body. Maybe my eyes were still closed. I can't remember.\nI felt like I was there for a while, because the woman behind me who had mostly collected herself by the time we made it inside the auditorium broke down again and just about threw me down. I didn't make a big deal out of it. I got up and shook the hands of the man's mother, father, grandmother, sister, uncle, other uncle, other grandmother, and the almost-widow; the fiancé, holding the hand of the three-year-old son. It was his birthday, too. I guess it was strange for both of us.\nI grabbed an empty seat in the back and listened to the politicians talk over the flag over the wood over the body. The man sitting to my right said something to the man sitting on his right and they both laughed. The sobbing woman sat to my left. A marine gave the almost-widow some medals. The uncle gave a funny eulogy. The other uncle gave a sad one. The father refused to go up at all and the almost-widow left at one point.

I said don't worry, I'm okay, I'll be home soon.\nSome hours later, after I blew out twenty-three candles and opened up gift cards and packages with ugly, ill-fitting clothes, I watched my mother cut up the cake and put the thin slices on plastic plates with big scoops of French vanilla ice cream.

{"text": "Wheel Balancing in Hyannis, MA\nOften confused with wheel alignment, wheel balancing ensures that your tires will spin vibration free. Irregularities and imperfections in the manufacturing of wheels and tires can result in heavy spots. Balancing your wheels minimizes the potential vibration caused by these imperfections, generally felt in the steering wheel, seat or floorboard. Wheel balancing is performed by placing measured weights opposite the \"heavy spot.\"\nWe recommend having your tires and wheels balanced when first installed, when there is evidence of balance-related tire wear, or every 10,000 to 12,000 miles as a measure of productive maintenance. Unbalanced tires can lead to uneven wear, vibration and potentially unsafe driving conditions. Vibration-free tires enhance ride control and performance, as well as extend the lifespan of a set of tires. From a safety standpoint, unbalanced tires can cause excessive vibration at high speeds, reducing handling and control which can lead to an accident. From an environmental point of view, balance-related wear will cause tires to wear prematurely\n\nQuestion: When should you have your tires and wheels balanced?

I opened the book and there were the pictures and diagrams from my vision. The book was complex. I could only understand a small portion of it but something in me was very excited. I had a strong feeling that I knew what Argüelles was trying to say and that I had known it before and that all I had to do was remember. The diagrams were beautiful and I was mesmerized and obsessed with them.\nTurning the pages of the book was like stepping through a gate into the unknown.\nI began to play with the designs in the book, especially the correlation between Benjamin Franklin's magic 8 square and the I Ching. I made drawings of the 64 hexagrams as black and white rectangles and glued them onto large pieces of foam board. During one session that lasted three days I created three pieces of art. One was a magic 8 square/hexagram correlation. Another consisted of the hexagrams placed close together so they looked like a bar code and the third was a chaotic arrangement of the 64 hexagrams.\nThe close together black and white rectangles I called 'God's Bar Code'. I was quite pleased with my results, which for some unknown reason gave me great pleasure.\nThat night I had a powerful dream. I woke from the dream in a state of high excitement. What did it mean?\nActivation.\nAs the day unfolded I began to recognize elements of my dream as real events. For instance, in the dream I had been watching an elephant flying and later on that morning I found myself at the beach watching someone flying a huge kite with a long tubular extension that looked like an elephant's trunk.

{"text": "Radiation X-ray Production\nDefinition/Introduction\nX-rays are a form of electromagnetic radiation with wavelengths ranging from 0.01 to 10 nanometers. In the setting of diagnostic radiology, X-rays have long enjoyed use in the imaging of body tissues and aid in the diagnosis of disease. Simply understood, the generation of X-rays occurs when electrons are accelerated under a potential difference and turned into electromagnetic radiation.[1] An X-ray tube, with its respective components placed in a vacuum, and a generator, make up the basic components of X-ray production. Essential components of an X-ray tube include a cathode, and an anode separated a short distance from each other, a vacuum enclosure, and high voltage cables forming the X-ray generator attached to the cathode and anode components.[2] In the generation of X-ray production, a cathode filament machined in a cathode cup is activated, causing intense heating of the cathode filament.[3] The heating of the filament leads to the release of electrons in a process called thermionic emission.[4] The released electrons form in an electron cloud at the filament surface, and repulsion forces prevent the ejection of electrons from this negatively charged cloud.[2] Upon application of a high voltage by an X-ray generator to the cathode as well as the anode, there is an acceleration of electrons ejected to an electrically positive anode.[3] The filament and the focusing cup determine this path of acceleration. The number of electrons is measured in the form of milliampere (mA) units, where 1 milliampere is equal to 6.24 x 10^15 electrons/s. Electron kinetic energy (measured in keV) is related to the applied voltage. The tube voltage, tube current, and exposure duration (measured in seconds) are adjustable by the user.\nOnce the high kinetic energy electrons finally reach the anode target, this initiates the process of X-ray production. Tungsten is often the usual anode target, although other material targets are also employed. Electrons come extremely close to the nucleus of the target, causing a deceleration and change in direction, converting the kinetic energy to electromagnetic radiation in a process known as \"breaking radiation\" or bremsstrahlung.[5] The output is a spectrum of X-ray energies. Incident electrons can also result in ionization, whereby the approaching electron can remove a second electron belonging to an atom of the anode target, losing its energy through ionization or excitation. This process leads to an emission of a photon as the electron orbit vacancy gets filled by an orbital shell electron from a further out shell. Considering orbital energies and their differences are unique in atoms, this leads to a \"characteristic X-ray\" with energies that can serve as a fingerprint unique to each anode target. Bremsstrahlung X-rays, however, constitute the majority of X-rays produced in this process.\n\nQuestion: What is the relationship between the electron kinetic energy and the applied voltage in an X-ray tube? Answer: The electron kinetic energy is related to the applied voltage\n\nQuestion: What is the range of wavelengths for X-rays? Answer: 0.01 to 10 nanometers\n\nQuestion: How is the number of electrons ejected from the cathode filament measured? Answer: In milliampere (mA) units, where 1 milliampere is equal to 6.24 x 10^15 electrons/s", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "2f29697d-cab8-445e-8028-d630faa5e4dd", "url": "https://www.statpearls.com/sp/md/149/32036/"}

{"text": "Dad's co-workers would be taken aback if anyone had thanked them - they had moved past combat and were in highly technical computer jobs, most as civilians, and downplayed the vet status, called themselves former military instead. Maybe there's a distinction there I don't know the nuance of. The were in Gulf Storm, so they did see combat.\nAs for San Diego, it's unusual for people to thank random people for their service from what I've seen - if anything, it's kinda a liability for your dating life if you're still active. My military friends who were new in the service thought it was absurd to be thanked when they hadn't even been deployed. My friends who have served are more focused on finding work and dealing with VA bullshit.\nHead outside the city, though, up to a rural spot like the mountains, and they'll go crazy - the Big Bear Renaissance Faire had a whole 5 minute ceremony for vets before the fake combat display. There was one vet there and he told us he hated it.\nTourist spots are hit and miss and depend on visitors. For example, Medieval Times up in Buena Park has a whole military tribute they pull out if they have military guests (not that unusual, it's a good group outing).\nThat's just my experience. I don't thank vets, maybe I'm bad, from from my experience growing up it's just never occurred to me to do it. Most of the vets I knew growing up were older and their service was just one facet of their history making them who they were, versus an active part of their identity, except for the first grandpa I listed, who reveled over his war days.\nYour intentions are wonderful, but anecdotally most people who served dont want to be thanked for it for whatever reason. I'm not a soldier nor even American, so take it with a pinch of salt, but most Americans who've served that I've spoken to arent particularly keen on being thanked for it.\nSo no, it's not inappropriate, but I've spoken to a few former servicepeople who have said they wish it were.\nI've learned not to thank service folk, I have gotten some stories from people that made me rethink it. One guy talked about his dead buddies and how he didn't think he should be thanked because they didn't survive. It drums up stuff for some people.\nAs someone who lives in Michigan and had a lot of family in rural Georgia: Rural Michigan feels far far more conservative than anywhere I've been in the south.\nOne of the upper management at my company was talking about a CNN clip this morning, and he finished off his joking about it by saying \"don't worry, I saw this on YouTube.

{"text": "This virus should be called something like the \"Ground Glass Fills Up Your Lungs Pneumonia Virus.\"\nLiterally, that's what it looks like on an X-ray. It looks like your lungs are full of ground glass, and it feels like that when you're trying to breathe, too.\nOne of the major problems is that it starts slowly for 3 days or so. It's a little tickle, a mild fever, if that. Sometimes, it's nothing. And for 3 days, you walk around spewing virus and don't even know it. And there are people around you spewing virus who don't know they're sick yet. That's the real terror of this virus, the \"prodromal\" phase.\nWhen you get the Flu, it slams into you like a ton of bricks. In 15 minutes, you know you're sick. Covid-19 is different. It creeps up on you.\nAnd then after 3 days, you get sick. Desperately sick.\nWhen people say a \"mild case\" of Covid-19 disease, they mean that you don't require hospitalization or else you will die. You're still going to be sick as hell, in bed, gasping for breath and trying to breathe through ground glass for 2 weeks. You may think that you are going to barf up your lungs. It's a very bad disease.\nAnother piece of terrible information out there is that in the first few days of illness, when the virus is replicating in your throat, that you can magically \"wash it away\" with water or vinegar or something. Wrong. Oh, so wrong. Once it's got a foothold and infects a few cells, that battle is lost. The only thing you can do is try not to infect others. If they get sick, they'll be competing for your hospital bed when you are close to dying. Keep away from everybody and try to get through it without infecting anyone else.\nNow, why did I say Listerine up there? Because if you can kill the virus before it infects you, then you might have a chance. Once it's established an infection, then it's just virus v. immune system, and you have to try to get well.\nI'm sorry about scaring you. I'm scared as hell. I mean, I've worked with HIV, a chickenpox virus that you can get again that had killed 5 people, and an emerging virus that killed a bunch of people in the Southwestern US.

Answer: The author has worked with HIV, a chickenpox virus that can be fatal, and an emerging virus that killed many people in the Southwestern US.\n\nQuestion: What is the only way to prevent spreading the virus after infection? Answer: The only way to prevent spreading the virus after infection is to stay away from others.\n\nQuestion: What does a \"mild case\" of COVID-19 mean?

{"text": "Building Managing High Performance Agile\nQuestion:\nWhat Is The Building Managing High Performance Agile?\nAnswer:\nIntroduction\nby providing support to one another. Example of the team includes sports team, project team and management team.\nDescribe how a group becomes a team\nA group can be converted into a team by encouraging the individuals to continue to work in a proper manner. The individuals need to be convinced about sharing similar goals and giving proper support to one another. This can help the individuals to form a team that can gain success. The development stages of a team can be utilised to ensure that the group members develop a feeling of unity and possess a sense of purpose (Nguyen 2016).\nOutline the characteristics of a good team\nA good team can communicate with one another and maintain the focus on the commitment made to the team and its members. They provide support to one another and ensure that every member of the team contributes to the task that has been assigned to them. According to Lanaj and Hollenbeck (2015), proper leadership is also required so that the team can be united and organised. A fun time can be arranged to prevent the monotonous working hours and provide refreshment for the betterment of the team.\nList the advantages of working in a team\nOne of the major benefits of working as a team is the fact that individuals can gain a vast experience. Working in a team exposes an individual to different other individuals belonging to different society or culture. This can help in enriching the knowledge of the individual in terms of variations in culture and ideas (Hoch and Kozlowski 2014). At the same time, working as a team in an organisation can be beneficial as better outcomes of a work can be maintained.\nExplain why it is important for people working in teams to be able to communicate with each other\nAs stated by Drescher et al. (2014) communication is important in every aspect, as without it people cannot express their emotions and ideas. Communication with people belonging to a team is required as different tasks are assigned to different people and communicating about the progress of the tasks can help in maintaining the update of the task. At the same time, communication also helps to build trust among the members.\nGive examples of barriers to communication that may prevent a team from working effectively\nExamples of barriers to communication can be in the form of unclear goals. As pointed out by Ford, Piccolo and Ford (2017) one of the chief characteristics of a team is that it is defined by the goals it sets for itself. Barriers to a communication may lead to the unclear defining of goals and subsequently provide a team with a disadvantage of maintaining stability in the team. Poor communication between leaders and members may also affect negatively as clear instructions cannot be provided.\nGive examples of behaviours that could cause conflict in a team\nAs stated by Guinalíu and Jordán (2016) a team consisting of individuals that belong to different cultures and have a different mindset. Thus, two examples of conflict can be provided to understand the concept better:\nDisagreement between team members due to the varied backgrounds and culture\n\nQuestion: What are two examples of conflict-causing behaviors in a team, as mentioned in the text? Answer: Disagreement due to varied backgrounds and cultures, and different mindsets.\n\nQuestion: What are two examples of barriers to communication that can prevent a team from working effectively?

{"text": "The combination of how much both nature and nurture impact our personality development is a complex topic that has been explored for years. While Nature and Nurture work together to develop our personality, we also have the option to choose how we act, despite our more natural tendencies. Even if you grew up in an abusive, strained family, you can still make the choice to be peaceful and loving when starting your own family. In order to make these decisions that seem to fight our own nature, though, we need to have a healthy level of self-awareness and understanding. Learning more about your own psychology and having a more comprehensive, honest view of yourself can help with your personal development.\nQuick Tip: You can make the first step in better understanding yourself by learning more about your personality through Crystal's free online test.\nNature vs Nurture\nMany psychologists today believe Nature and Nurture actually work together, in a balanced way, to make us who we are - rather than working against one another. In many cases, some naturally occurring genes cannot be activated without certain environmental factors. Research in areas like this, where gene expression is influenced by something other than the DNA sequence itself, has even lead to the development of a new field of study called Epigenetics. While researchers are still working to uncover more information about how we develop as people, it's clear that Nature and Nurture both play major roles in making us who we are.\nWhy does it matter?\nAs we learn more about the influence of genetics and environments on personality and personal development (and the impact it has on the nature vs nurture discussion), we come closer to finding treatments for mental health issues, personality disorders, and more. By further understanding how we become who we are, we can help people work through traumatic issues, find ways to heal, and prevent problems from occurring in the first place.\n\nQuestion: What can learning about one's psychology help with?

Sometimes it's just easier for my partner to take Jack so LSB can play off of him, or I'll take Jack and Sally because more of their monsters are in the scene, but LSB aren't, or if it's a big crowd scene, we'll both play various Halloween Town citizens and switch off Jack as needed depending on what's easiest to keep the flow going. Just whatever needs to be done, we both have the power to do it instead of relying on one person playing this one NPC all the time.\nI don't like doing 1x1s with strangers, I tried to do it, it failed. I prefer doing it with someone I've RPed with before.\nYou may be wondering, how that's different from RPing with a group of strangers? It is different. 1x1s are much more intimate. I prefer doing that with someone who knows my RPing style, and knows how to work with me. As well as vice versa.\nI have done plenty of 1x1's on here and way more often than not, the other person dropped me. (Leaving the DM's. IDK why but it hurts still.) And I'm more used to them than groups (as groups for me tended to die quickly) the results haven't been the greatest for me as it seems nothing really sticks no matter the effort. Overall, I do them with a Player/Player style with two people contributing to the RP and also the story and plot direction as it shows engagement and interest to me. I also have done ERP's as well as I have been on the guild for 3 years but 1x1's I have been doing for way longer.I love collaborations in general, so I very much tend to the player/player kind of style. I usually have SOME idea of where the story is going to go- not necessarily an end point, but a goal for the characters to work towards at the start. Both of us contribute plot points, characters, etc.\nSometimes there's a lot of discussion beforehand, sometimes there's not. During the stories there is always OOC discussion (in a separate thread) as to where we're going.\nSeconding this, especially as someone who looks for non smut-related checks in a section populated by smut checks.

{"text": "A brand new law for kid intercourse offenders harkens back once again to a time whenever significantly less was understood about human being sex.\nAlabama enacted a law that may need, as a disorder of parole, that some convicted kid intercourse offenders undergo \"chemical castration. Today\"\nThe law that is new signify people who abused kiddies underneath the chronilogical age of 13 will likely be injected with hormone-blocking medications before making jail. The medicine shall need to be administered until a judge, perhaps not a physician, deemed it not any longer necessary.\nThe same bill had been proposed a year ago in Oklahoma but came across strong opposition. The previous Soviet republic of Moldova additionally passed a legislation chemical that is mandating for kid intercourse offenders, in 2012. It absolutely was repealed the following year on grounds it was a \"violation of fundamental peoples legal rights. \"\nUnlike castrating a bull, chemical castration will not include getting rid of a person's testicles—though the Alabama bill's sponsor, Representative Steve Hurst, initially advocated the approach that is surgical.\nAlternatively, the process utilizes various medications to make the testicles unimportant. Generally in most situations, medicine causes the gland that is pituitary reduce testosterone to prepubescent amounts. During debate associated with bill, Hurst stated that when chemical castration, which includes a stated objective of decreasing libido to stop future crimes, \"will help 1 or 2 kiddies, and decrease that desire to the stage that individual will not harm that kid, it is worth every penny. \"\nIt still wouldn't be clear whether this approach will have the desired effect on recidivism if we could put ethical considerations about nonconsensual medical treatment aside. Many research in your community places desire that is sexual in the listing of reasons individuals assault young ones. The most useful predictor of intimate attack just isn't libido, research has shown, but \"an very very early and persistent basic tendency to behave in an antisocial way during youth and adolescence. \"\nThe physiological aftereffects of androgen blockers are very well founded, since the medications found in chemical castration will also be widely used in individuals with cancer tumors, particularly associated with the prostate, where testosterone can really help tumors develop. The sudden removal of androgenic hormones has been known to impair performance on visual-motor tasks and cause declines in bone density, increased rates of fractures, and depressive symptoms in addition to lowering libido and causing sexual dysfunction.\nIt is often well demonstrated that medical castration, which was practiced in several places for millennia, makes intercourse offenders either reluctant or just struggling to commit future offenses. Evidence on chemical castration is a lot less clear. Within the same manner that getting rid of the arms of a bread thief could theoretically assist in preventing future crimes, making a person's genitals less virile makes certain acts less feasible. But unlike other healing approaches, chemical castration (or castration that is surgical for instance) will not address the antisocial instincts that usually underlie such crimes.\n\nQuestion: What is the primary aim of the chemical castration process used in the Alabama law? Answer: The primary aim is to decrease libido and prevent future crimes by reducing testosterone levels to prepubescent amounts.\n\nQuestion: Was the Alabama law the first of its kind to mandate chemical castration for child sex offenders?

{"text": "Tag Archives: hero\nThese have been the most prized traits in many YA romantic heroes over the past decade or so. But why did protective feel like stalking? Why did strength trump kindness? Worst of all, aggressive translated to controlling. (I'm looking at you, Edward Cullen.)\nFast forward to the present, and a new romantic leading man is emerging in YA literature, one that I admit finally has the power to make my heart pound.\nWarm. Respectful. Selfless.\nThe new YA Prince Charming is as flawed, even broken, as the heroine that he loves, but what really makes him stand apart is that he is a partner, not a protector. He doesn't fiercely guard \"his woman\" because she is an extension of himself. Rather, his goals are broader, he embraces being good and making the world better, with a woman as strong and selfless as he is by his side.\nMy favorite example of the new YA Prince Charming is Rhysand from Sarah. J. Maas' trilogy, The Court of Thorns and Roses. Rhys (we're close enough now to go by nicknames) fundamentally respects Feyre, as well as the choices she makes. It's not just lip service; he accepts her decisions even when they place her in danger. Feyre and Rhys challenge each other, make each other better versions of themselves. Life has victimized them both, and they want to raise themselves and each other up as equals. Throw in Rhys' violet eyes and sensitive…wings, and you've got the makings of a swoon-worthy hero.\nI've seen elements of rounder, more lovable and loving heroes popping up in YA literature and beyond. It's refreshing, new, and hopefully more than a trend. Here's to a future filled with heroes and heroines who have each other's backs, where the tropes of romance can be stretched and broken, just like in real life.\nOf course, there are a few traits that remain the same for heroes old and new.\n\nQuestion: How does the new YA Prince Charming differ from the old YA heroes in terms of his relationship with the heroine?

So perhaps it's not exactly above the fold. The important thing is I noticed it and now you have to hear me talk about it.\nAnyway, this is the story about a game. Specifically, a wargame called King Phillip's War created by a social studies teacher named John Poniske. Based off of King Philip's War, a little-known pre-revolutionary conflict between English settlers in New England and a number of Native American tribes, it's being targeted due to its violent nature and insensitivity to the Natives.\nThese guys are gonna party like it's 1675–1676\nThe Native American tribes are protesting the fact that the game trivializes the losses they suffered at the hands of the colonists, and also paints the natives as bloodthirsty savages, an image they have worked hard to erase from the cultural consciousness.\nDebates like this crop up from time to time in wargaming circles.Actually, no, that's a lie. This sort of thing is never discussed by wargamers because anyone playing wargames already knows their opinion about this. It would be like the local chapter of the NRA discussing the merits of gun control--if you were for it, you wouldn't be there. But it does appear on the periphery from time to time.\nSome people find it difficult to separate themselves from the game and its historical context. How can you play a game, they say, for fun, when you're representing the worst of human nature? And I have to admit there's a touch of truth to it--there are certain boundaries of taste one has to consider when dealing with war. But wargames have been around for a long, long time, and very few individuals stand up and object. Wargames tend to be quite impersonal and most individuals can separate the historical context from what they are participating in when they play these games.\nWargame designers pride themselves in historical accuracy. Many individuals learn about these little-known battles because they were drawn to a game. Making history interactive is a very useful tool in education. Reading about a battle is one thing; but understanding the decision-making process is another, and wargames do a very good job of that.\nDesigners also have to strike a delicate balance, however, and a lot of times this is how they get in trouble. If they keep too close to the historical events, they create a game with a forgone conclusion--the real-life winner will always win the game. However, make it too even, and you'll stray from realism far enough that you're no longer presenting a historical simulation. There are plenty of game mechanics that solve this, but not all designers succeed. Those that don't aren't around for long.\n\nQuestion: Who created this wargame? Answer: John Poniske\n\nQuestion: What happens to designers who do not succeed in this balance? Answer: They may not remain in the industry for long.\n\nQuestion: In which time period does the game's historical context take place? Answer: 1675-1676\n\nQuestion: What is the game being criticized for?

Of all the dogs in need of homes, they need our compassion the most. They often gave their unconditional love to their owners only to find themselves abandoned in their final years. So, like Gary and Bill, let's help and make a senior dog's final years the best ones.\nI started When Hounds Fly Dog Training in January 2010 as an experiment to see whether dog training services – specifically, centered around Clicker Training, could become a full-time career for me.\nAt the time, most of the dog training schools operating in Toronto were part-time businesses, where the instructors drew their primary income from either white-collar day jobs, or made the majority of their income through other dog-related services (such as dog walking).\nFast forward to 2017 and When Hounds Fly now has four employees (if you include myself), three of whom work full time, doing dog training and behaviour consulting. So, the experiment paid off!\nOur Past Instructors\nOne of the biggest challenges I've faced in growing this company is finding qualified people that met my high standards for instructors. In the early days, I was extremely lucky and qualified people found me. My early part-time instructors came already knowledgeable, already experienced, no training or skills development required.\n\nQuestion: What was one of the biggest challenges faced by the founder in growing the company? Answer: Finding qualified people that met their high standards for instructors.\n\nQuestion: How many employees did When Hounds Fly have by 2017? Answer: Four, including the founder.\n\nQuestion: When did Sandy start taking classes with the dog trainer?

{"text": "The creepers Gonocarpus incanus (pictured in the gallery) and G. micranthus (right) are small-leaved herbs that come under the ground-hugging dimension of the category piripiri.G. micranthus has stems up to about 10 cm tall, which root at the nodes as it creeps along the ground. It has small reddish flowers and tiny dark red 8-ribbed fruit. It prefers to grow in boggy and peaty places. It is native to New Zealand, and found throughout the country. This species is found also in Australia, India, Malaya, Japan, and China. G. incanus has much longer stems, up to 40 cm tall, although they can also spread prostrate along the ground. It is found in the North Island and northern parts of the South Island, on dry, hard ground.\nThe category \"piripiri\" also includes a tiny orchid, Bulbophyllum pygmaeum, which perches on trees, and occasionally on rocks. It is found high up in trees, but also sometimes forms large mats in favourable locations closer to the ground. Its small pseudo-bulbs are about the size of a pea and covered with minute hairs, each accompanied by a single leaf (as shown in the greatly enlarged image on the left), with a tiny white flower. This species is endemic to New Zealand, and is found naturally in forest in coastal to montane areas from Stewart Island to the Three Kings, but more commonly in the North. The other New Zealand species of Bulbophyllum, B. tuberculatum, would also fit the category of \"piripiri\". This orchid appears to be rather uncommon, possibly because it simply has not been noticed as often; its leaves are much larger than those of B. pygmaeum (up to 5 cm long), and it has smooth pseudobulbs which often bear more than one flower. Its colonies are more compact than the spread-out clusters of B. pygmaeum. It has a similar distribution to B. pygmaeum, except that its range does not extend beyond the lowlands, and it is always associated with particular species of grey lichen.\nPittosporum cornifolium, tāwhirikaro, is an epyphytic shrub, which grows to about 2 metres high perched on trees or rocks. It has bright green leaves and small red flowers; the interior of its fruit capsules is bright orange. It is found in lowland forests in the upper half of the North Island.\nAnother group of plants also may come under the heading piripiri. These are the varieties of the liverwort species Chiloscyphus novae-zeelandiae (Lopohocoleaceae), tiny plants found in cushions clinging to rocks or wood in forest stream beds. The image on the right shows a thumbnail-sized section of a cushion of these plants. Other similar liverworts may also go by this name.\n\nQuestion: Which plant has stems that can grow up to 40 cm tall?

{"text": "This world is temporary and is quickly coming to an end. It's the next one that matters because it's the permanent one. Regardless of what happens today, at its end we'll be one day closer to a guaranteed inheritance that's beyond human comprehension. A few hours of time and today is gone, but our inheritance is eternal and cannot be taken from us (John 10:27-30). We should stop worrying so much about this life, start thinking more about how great the next one will be, and visualize ourselves there. The Holy Spirit will help us.\nNo eye has seen, no ear has heard, no mind has conceived what God has prepared for those who love him, but God has revealed it to us by his Spirit (1 Cor. 2:8-10).\nThe Power of Affirmation or Self Talk\nI have learned the secret of being content in any and every situation, whether well fed or hungry, whether living in plenty or in want. I can do everything through him who gives me strength (Phil 4:12-13).\nBlessed are we who've been given everything for we don't have to worry about anything. Affirmations like this adaptation of the Beatitudes (Matt. 5:3-12) have been described as statements made in times of doubt that would otherwise be true. Bible verses make the best affirmations because we know they're not just wishful thinking, they're the promises of God. Paul knew that no matter what his earthly situation was, the Lord had given him the strength to endure and therefore he could always be content. Repeating Phil. 4:13 when we're discouraged reminds us that promise is for us too.\nWhen it came to behavioral psychology, Paul was greater than Sigmund Freud, Carl Jung, B.F. Skinner, Abraham Maslow and all the others combined. When it came to motivational writing he topped Norman Vincent Peale, Robert Shuller, Dale Carnegie, Napoleon Hill, and anyone else you can name. No wonder he started so many churches. No wonder he was so thoroughly despised by his enemies.\nWhy The Big Secret?\nToday, these Biblical principles have been hijacked by secular humanists and even proponents of other \"religions,\" who deceitfully claim them as their own. They remove God from the equation, promoting the supremacy of the human spirit or the achievement of some kind of personal godhood instead. They often derive great fame and fortune from sharing their \"secrets\", omitting any mention of their actual origin.\nOut of Biblical ignorance, the Church largely ignores or even fears these truths. And yet, even with God out of the picture they've have helped bring great success to countless followers. How much more powerful would they be if we used them for the purpose God intended? How many defeated lives would be changed? How many oppressed and enslaved believers would be set free?\nWhose Idea Was This Anyway?\n\nQuestion: What does the Holy Spirit help us with, according to the text?

{"text": "What If My Plan Isn't Working?\nOne of the most common things people worry about when working out from home is whether or not they will actually see results. If you are working hard but aren't seeing the results you were hoping for with your home workout, you might be tempted to throw in the towel. But don't give up too fast, you might just need some simple tweaks, or mindset shifts, to help you break through your plateaus or find the missing link in your plan.\nSee our tips below when you need help with adjusting your plan to better suit your personal needs and meet your goals.\nRe-Evaluate Your Success – one of the first things you should do when you feel like you are not making progress is to re-evaluate what you define your success as. Often, we equate weight loss as being the only benefit of working out. But you gain so much more from working out than just a smaller pant size. Look at the big picture, how do you feel when you consistently follow your home workout plan? Do you have more energy when you workout from home? Do everyday activities such as walking up the stairs seem easier? There is so much more to your workout success than weight loss. Before you throw in the towel, give yourself some credit, you might just be on the brink of seeing some of the results you were hoping for.\nGet Help – if you are feeling really stuck with your home workout plan, it might be a good idea to find help. There are many personal trainers who are willing to work with you to help you develop a sustainable and effective plan that you can do at home. You might just need some simple tweaks or corrections on your form in order to help you push through your rut.\nIn our previous article \"What Makes a Good Personal Trainer,\" we outline what you should look for when finding the right trainer for you. These tips apply whether you are working with a virtual trainer or in person. A great personal trainer will offer extensive value and knowledge to help you meet your goals.\nBalance Your Home Workout with a Gym – just because you work out at home does not mean you cannot work out at a gym too. Sometimes its best to have a mix between working out at home and spending time in a gym. If you find that a community environment helps you stay consistent, why not look for gyms that offer drop-in classes?\nAt Grants MMA & Boxing Gym, we offer unlimited memberships for those who want regular access but we also provide drop-in options for those who simply want a class environment part-time. Drop-in classes are a great way to see if the gym environment is right for you, or simply balance your personal schedule to attend when it's convenient. You can even try out a variety of classes such as boxing classes, or anything else that is of interest to you.\nMake Sure Your Plan is Enjoyable – if you are still not seeing success with your workout plan, maybe its because you are not enjoying it. Always make sure that you choose a workout plan that you actually want to do. When you develop a home workout plan, you are the boss. If something is not working for you go back to the drawing board and try something new.\n\nQuestion: What are some non-weight related benefits of working out? Answer: Increased energy, easier everyday activities, and improved overall health.\n\nQuestion: What does Grants MMA & Boxing Gym offer for those who want to try out different classes part-time?

{"text": "What does love have to do with stewardship? … We know that we are called to be disciples of Christ and the path to being a disciple is through living a life of stewardship. Jesus tells us exactly how to achieve this in St. John's gospel when He says, \"Love one another. As I have loved you, so you should love one another. This is how all will know that you are my disciples, if you have love for one another.\" (John 14: 34-35)\nStewardship is responding to God's call to give with a loving heart. St. Paul's letter to the Galatians reminds us to \"…Serve one another through love . . . bear one another's burdens, and so you will fulfill the law of Christ\" (Gal 5:13, 6:2) In our busy lives it can be difficult to find the time to serve those in need. The annual Catholic Charities Appeal is a powerful way to show our love for those in need. The ministries funded by the Catholic Charities Appeal show the love of Christ by serving those in need right here in our communities.\nThe gospels confirm how passionate Jesus was about love. In fact He declared love the greatest of all commandments. St. Matthew and St. Mark recount Jesus' response when asked by a scribe what is the greatest commandment: \"He said to him, 'You shall love the Lord, your God, with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your mind. This is the greatest and the first commandment. The second is like it: You shall love your neighbor as yourself.'\" (Matthew 22:37-39) & (Mark 12:29-31) The call or command to love is not about a feeling or emotion, it is about the decision to love and obey God.\nNote: The USCCB's pastoral letter titled Stewardship: A Disciples Response defines a Christian steward as \"One who receives God's gifts gratefully, cherishes and tends them in a responsible and accountable manner, shares them in justice and love with all, and returns them with increase to the Lord.\"\n\nQuestion: What does the text describe as a Christian steward?

Not too bad considering this was their first time in the competition. Their car was aerodynamic and well designed, all of which helped attain a quick time. The team has vowed to improve their reaction time (0.181seconds), and hope to beat their own record next year.\nIn addition to the race itself, teams had to produce a printed Portfolio explaining how the car was designed and tested, prepare a verbal presentation explaining the entire design process, as well as produce a pit display showcasing their works and advertising the team.\nThis was a long journey for Team Arrow.

It is a common eye disorder caused by either bacteria or a skin condition such as dandruff of the scalp or acne rosacea. It can affect people of all ages. Although it causes some discomfort, blepharitis is not contagious and generally does not cause any permanent damage to eyesight.\nTreatment depends on the specific type of blepharitis. The key to treating most types of blepharitis is keeping the lids clean and free of crusts. It is often recommended to limit or cease the use of eye makeup during treatment.\nWarm compresses can be applied to loosen crusts, followed by gentle scrubbing of the eyes with a mixture of water and baby shampoo or an over-the-counter eyelid cleanser. In cases involving bacterial infection, an antibiotic may also be prescribed. If the glands in the eyelids are blocked, the eyelids may need to be massaged to unclog them.The treatment for a stye is the same than for a chalazion.\n\nQuestion: Is blepharitis a contagious condition?

The more prepared you and your child are for the exposure, the less anxious they will be and the better their chances for success. Don't forget that your plan may look good on paper, but end up to be too difficult in real life. Make adjustments as needed.\nWhen creating a brave speaking ladder keep in mind the verbal communication load of the activity. Start low and move up. Here are some general guidelines, but each child is different and may not follow the same order.\nRemember when moving up the ladder, don't make too many changes at once. It is suggested that you change just one variable at a time – the activity, the location, or the people involved. Repeat the same activity or step on the ladder several times, until the child is able to complete it with relative ease, before moving on to something new.\nIf your child is starting out completely mute, you may start exposures with nonverbal communication activities and move toward speech. See the SMart Center's Stages of Social Communication for an example of steps that move from nonverbal to verbal activities.\nPublished by JaNae Haycock\nI am the mother of 4 wonderful and crazy kids.

{"text": "Critics argue that the RICO law paves the way for the FBI and other government organizations to use any of a number of means of surveillance, many of which are considered shady at best, to convict criminals. Some critics argue that, by making rules like the RICO act, the government is the true organized criminal enterprise, bending the constitution for its own benefit.\nProponents, however, counter that organized crime organizations, including terrorist cells, could not be defeated without the RICO act.\nBut critics have gotten more ammunition in recent years. The RICO act has been cited in an increasing number of court cases. It has been used against defendants far outside the realm of organized crime, oftentimes with consultation from Blakey. The act was exercised against tobacco companies.\nRecently, it has been applied against the Roman Catholic Church. Missouri lawyers claimed that by having knowledge that priests committed sexual acts against children, the Church is a part of a criminal conspiracy and, therefore, the hierarchy is subject to the RICO act.\nBut with the Al-Arian case, the government has seemed to return RICO to its roots of Mafia-style crime. And that seems to be bad news for Al-Arian. If the government can prove that Al-Arian is indeed the head of PIJ in the United States, then crimes committed by anyone in the criminal \"family\" beneath him can be used against him. The government, in the last three decades, has gotten very good at using this controversial act. Now Al-Arian will have to find a defense.\nMost recently, defendants have successfully beaten RICO cases by arguing the definition of a criminal conspiracy. Those results have somewhat narrowed the act back to its original intention — snuffing out organized crime. Those defenses won't help Al-Arian, however, because he is accused under RICO's base definition of heading an organized criminal group.\nTherefore, Al-Arian will have to prove that no such criminal conspiracy exists. That will be difficult with the apparent wiretap and monetary paper trail that, according to the indictment, exists against him. Also, Al-Arian has associated with Ramadan Abdullah Shallah, the former USF instructor who now reportedly heads PIJ. His alleged activities are well known, and, if the government can prove a criminal conspiracy, the connection would probably lead to yet another RICO conviction and a long prison sentence.\nRICO cases are beatable, but the government has had lots of practice. Now Al-Arian's attorney, Nicholas Matassini, will have to find a defense against an experienced prosecutor of organized crime\n\nQuestion: What does Al-Arian need to prove to defend against the RICO charges? Answer: He needs to prove that no criminal conspiracy exists.\n\nQuestion: What is the likely outcome if the government proves a criminal conspiracy involving Al-Arian and Shallah? Answer: It would likely lead to another RICO conviction and a long prison sentence for Al-Arian.\n\nQuestion: Who is Ramadan Abdullah Shallah and how is he connected to Al-Arian? Answer: Shallah is the former USF instructor who reportedly heads PIJ, and he has associated with Al-Arian.", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "fc73a6a6-e111-4188-b280-767271ad3492", "url": "http://www.usforacle.com/2003/02/25/al-arian-faces-tough-mob-law/"}

The current Ragusa Ibla lies probably on one of them, identified as Hybla Heraea.\nThe ancient city, located on a hill, 300 metres (980 ft) high, entered in contact with the nearby Greek colonies, and developed thanks to the nearby port of Camerina. After a short Carthaginian rule, it was administered by the Romans and the Byzantines: the latter fortified the city and built a large castle. Ragusa was occupied by the Arabs in 848 AD, remaining under their rule until the 11th century, when the Normans conquered it. Selected as County seat, its first Count was Geoffrey, son of Count Roger I of Sicily.\nRagusa thereafter followed the events of the Kingdom of Sicily, created in the first half of the twelfth century. A Chiaramonte family fief, it remained the county capital after the unification with that of Modica in 1296, a status it lost in the 15th century after a popular revolt.\nIn 1693 the city was devastated by a huge earthquake, which killed some 5,000 inhabitants. Following this catastrophe the city was largely rebuilt, many baroque buildings date from this period. Most of the population moved to a new settlement in the former district of Patro, calling the new municipality \"Ragusa Superiore\" (Upper Ragusa) and the ancient city \"Ragusa Inferiore\" (Lower Ragusa). The two cities remained separated until 1926, when they were fused together to become the provincial capital in 1927 at the expense of Modica, the former capital and the most populous and important city in the region since 1296.\nIn 1838 an asphalt deposit was discovered, which is still being worked.\nEconomy\nMain sights\nThe city has two distinct areas, the lower and older town of Ragusa Ibla, and the higher Ragusa Superiore (Upper Town). The two halves are separated by the Valle dei Ponti, a deep ravine crossed by four bridges. The most noteworthy of them is the eighteenth-century Ponte dei Cappuccini.\nUpper Town\n\nQuestion: What was the population of Ragusa before the 1693 earthquake?

{"text": "I have to admit that I don't even remember if I liked that mechanic after so many years - it would certainly be more difficult than now\nBut also battles like those at Guadalcanal SCN would last much shorter and more RPs would have to be spent on rebuilding the fleet after such a battle\nby GabeKnight » 03 Oct 2020 00:55I believe that this behavior of AI ships is a serious mistake, because the basic tactic of classic naval battles is Crossing the T, when one side uses its form to conduct broadside fire (all towers are used), while the other side can only use 1 bow turret .\nIn the event of a quick destruction of the ships leading the enemy formation, the remaining ones stop and do not enter the trap.\nIn fact, the AI didn't scare my line of fire, but it definitely went dumb.\nI suppose my tactic can be considered a variant of this T-tactic, because the first 3 destroyers I sunk went in a linear formation, the other ships rather too, only 2-3 parallel tracks butYes, indeed\nThis great Japanese victory certainly influenced the tactics of classic naval battles for the next decades, why reject something that still works great?\nCrossing the T is the opposite of what Nelson did. Naval tactics in the 17-18th century relied heavily on the idea of getting ahead of the enemy line and using raking fire aka crossing the T. Usually this resulted in not much at all as both sides simply fired away inconclusively in broadside lines until one got bored and sailed off with minimal losses. Or somebody ran out of ammunition. Losses of ships were rare unless someone really screwed up.\nNelson conducted a columnar attack in two lines, meaning he allowed his T to be crossed in order to close with the enemy and decisively defeat them at short range and with boarding actions. This allowed him to capture or destroy 22 of the enemy's 27 ships of the line. His tactic was literally revolutionary but relied heavily on seamanship and crew skill.\nbutPositioning already matters. If your ships move fast, you get a defensive bonus. If they maintain position relative to the enemy they can move great distances while keeping the same accuracy. If you close with enemy ships both of you do more damage. If you remain at range both of you do less damage. If you move away at speed the enemy will do minimal damage. If you allow enemy destroyers to close with your heavy ships you will receive enormous damage from torpedoes, necessitating screens for these ships.\n\nQuestion: What was the result of Nelson's tactic at the Battle of the Nile?

{"text": "Yeah I'm not disputing whether it is, just sort of wondering whether there is an actual specific definition for the term or if it is just one of them things which everyone has a different definition for, like warmth in an audio signal.\nThere is no definition because it's not a technical term. \"General purpose programming language\" is also a better description because it's clearer that the programming language can be used for many different purposes.\nDoes it though? Fully-fledged to me sounds like it means more like stable, not in beta, mature. Fledge refers to a bird getting its feathers for flight. There's a specification, a committee, and an organizational process to make changes. It's a mature language with no unexpected changes. I'd argue HTML is fully-fledged, too. I don't think fully-fledged means general purpose.\nIn my understanding this would make, for example, CSS or HTML semi fledged as they have a very specific purpose and are comparatively limited.\nNot necessarily. HTMLBut wait, doesn't JS render its front end into HTML and CSS?Unless you mean Node.js rendering template views, in which case the same is true for all back-end frameworks that use templates.\nWould that requirement not, ultimately, make it a semi fledged language?As to the original question, I can't honestly think off the top of my head any language I'd describe as \"semi-fledged\". Lua maybe? Not sure, as I've never used it. Bash, or any of the console scripting languages? They are relatively limited. Overall, I understand the distinction you're trying to make (i.e. JS isn't just the in-browser language anymore, it's full-featured and general purpose), but I think you're getting wrapped up in the semantics instead of the important parts.\nThank you so much for the time! You confirmed what I started suspecting as I was typing -- I was caught up in semantics, something which often happens with me.. It does lead me to think that maybe listing 'fully fledged' is probably more of a case of trying to dispel old opinions of the language, as /u/wreckedadvent said above.I simply mean that, if I use React's JSX language to make a web page and express on the backend with node, it will still, ultimately, be presented as HTML to the end user in their browser. Maybe render is the wrong word here.You're 100% right as JS can still interact with the user and machine without presenting through HTML - I think by the time I had got down to that part I was way too far down the rabbit hole.\nHTMLI get that, I was more trying to highlight that I had no idea to the alternative to full fledged -- HTML/CSS have a specific purpose which is why I used them as examples.\nit will still, ultimately, be presented as HTML to the end user in their browser\n\nQuestion: Is \"fully-fledged\" a technical term?

With this interpretation of wisdom, it makes sense that it is described in such a powerful and resplendent way:\n\"[Wisdom] is more precious than jewels, and nothing you desire can compare with her. Long life is in her right hand; in her left hand are riches and honor. Her ways are ways of pleasantness, and all her paths are peace.

{"text": "Serum TSH levels are often mildly abnormal (≤ 7 mIU/L) in children and adolescents who are morbidly obese (>20 lb overweight). If the serum free T4 level is normal, the growth velocity has been normal for at least 6 months, the serum TSH level remains stable (not rising) over at least 3 months, and no other signs of hypothyroidism are present, these children and adolescents do not require routine T4 therapy.\nT4 is present in both the free state and bound to TBG. Total T4 assays measure T4 in both states and are useful to establish the diagnosis of primary hypothyroidism and to assess response to treatment. Free T4 should be directly measured with the equilibrium dialysis method. Many laboratories report a calculated value termed the free T4 index, which is an estimate of the free T4 concentration, not a measurement. The free T4 index is calculated by multiplying the T4 by the T3 resin uptake. Serum free T4 by equilibrium dialysis should be measured when secondary hypothyroidism (pituitary TSH deficiency) or tertiary hypothyroidism (hypothalamic TRH deficiency) is suggested.\nMeasurement of serum T3 concentration, free or total, is not required to confirm the diagnosis of hypothyroidism.\nNewborn screening for congenital hypothyroidism includes the following:\nRequired by US law in all 50 states, these programs measure total T4 levels using a filter paper–based assay. In those neonates whose serum T4 level falls within the lowest 10th percentile for newborns screened that day by the program, T4 is reassayed, and TSH is simultaneously determined. Remember that, even with the best screening programs, infants with hypothyroidism can be missed. Therefore, the occurrence of a normal screening result must not preclude thyroid function testing in any infant with signs or symptoms of hypothyroidism.\nInfants with abnormal or borderline screening results should have total T4 and TSH obtained for definitive testing. Thyroid hormone replacement may be empirically initiated while awaiting the confirmatory studies.\nIn infants, if the serum total T4 is less than 85 nmol/L (< 7 mg/dL), with TSH more than 40 mIU/L, congenital hypothyroidism is likely. If total T4 is low, and serum TSH is not elevated, TBG deficiency, central hypothyroidism, or euthyroid sick syndrome should be considered, and repeat testing may be needed.[5] Serum free T4 concentration is normal in TBG deficiency. Normal TSH (< 20 mIU/L) in the presence of low total T4 and free T4 concentrations suggest secondary or tertiary causes of hypothyroidism. In the latter, signs of associated hypopituitarism (eg, poor feeding, hypoglycemia) and physical findings (eg, midline defects, micropenis) support the diagnosis. All such infants should be screened for other pituitary hormone deficiencies (see Hypopituitarism).\n\nQuestion: Which method should be used to directly measure free T4?

That means slashing enormous police budgets. That means decriminalizing drug use and repealing other federal laws that have for too long been used to disproportionately criminalize Black women, children, and families. BREATHE will put us on the road to police and prison abolition, letting our loved ones out of federal prison and immigration detention facilities and building nurturing reentry systems to welcome them home and put them on the path to success and citizenship.\n... BREATHE will provide organizations rooted in their communities with the funds to create public safety systems uniquely tailored to their community's needs and incentivize states to decarcerate and defund.\nFinally, BREATHE seeks to address past wrongs. We want to radically reimagine public safety and take our communities in a new direction, but we cannot gloss over 400 years of harm.

{"text": "Food Aggression In Dogs And How You Can Stop It\nFood Aggression In Dogs Is A Common Problem\nA lot of dog owners really love feeding time. Dogs know when feeding time is, and they are very demonstrative about how happy they are when feeding time comes around. While all dogs are happy about the prospect of being fed though, some dogs tend to behave quite aggressively once their food has been served.\nSome dogs growl if someone is too near them while they eat. Worse still, some dogs go to the extent of snapping at anyone they perceive as \"too close\" while they are feeding. This type of aggression in dogs is quite common. It should not go uncurbed, as it could deteriorate into other forms of aggression if simply left unchecked.\nThe Remedy For Food Aggression In Dogs\nShow Your Dog Who's Boss\nThe key to checking food aggression in dogs early is in showing your dog who the boss is. You don't need to actually punish your dog to get that message across. The best way to demonstrate you are the boss is by establishing a consistent feeding schedule. Feed your dog only at certain preset times and don't deviate from your routine.\nNo Treats Between Meals\nDon't feed your dog anything in between meals, and get the cooperation of other household members who interact with your dog. In the event that your dog is too full to eat during mealtime, don't leave the food out. Feed your pet again only at the next scheduled mealtime.\nARTICLE CONTINUES AFTER ADVERTISEMENT\nAlways Feed Your Dog Last\nEstablishing a rigid schedule will give your dog a clear picture of who dictates when and how much he or she eats. This is essential if you want to curb your dog's aggression while eating. A second important thing to establish is the order of importance. Always feed your dog after your family and not before.\nNo Feeding At The Table\nIf your dog begs at the table, don't allow him or her to be fed. Feed your dog after your family is finished eating. That way, the dog will understand his or her rank in terms of superiority in the house. This again will go a long way towards toning down your dog's aggression.\nGiving table scraps is never a good practice for many reasons:\nFirst of all, it's unsanitary, your dog will probably end up taking the food away and trying to eat it somewhere else. Wherever he or she does eat, it will be a mess after.\nSecondly, dog food is nutritionally balanced to be ideal for dogs, and scraps from the table will upset that balance.\nThird, it is disastrous from a behavioral standpoint, your dog will feel that you can be manipulated. This will upset your established schedule and undermine your credibility as the master.\nWatch Your Dog Eat\nWhen feeding time does come around though, make sure that while training your dog, someone is there to watch him or her eat. This will also help drive home the point that people will not try to take away their food.\nAdditional Method For Older Dogs\n\nQuestion: Is food aggression in dogs a common problem? Answer: Yes, it is a common problem.\n\nQuestion: What is one way dogs show aggression during feeding time?

In the early twentieth century, the government wanted assimilation for Natives, working to mold them into Americans, which entailed Natives being forced to abandon their culture.[2] During the presidency of Franklin D. Roosevelt, the government made positive strides in terms of Native American treatment, though termination policies in the 1950s, which included the U.S. government being able to cease protection of Native tribes, undid some of these positive changes.[3] But, groups like the American Indian Movement (AIM) rose in the late 1960s and 70s, helping to bring about policy changes and spark awareness over Native rights.[4](more…)\nExploring the Hudson River School and Its Relationship with the Conservation Movement\nIntroduction\nAmerican Pulitzer Prize Winner Wallace Stegner once said: \"National parks were the best idea we ever had.\"[1] But, where does the idea of building a park come from? Today, it seems instinctive for everyone to want to protect the earth. However, this sentiment was not instinctive. Now, we all know that conservation focuses on protecting natural resources and the environment, but in reality, the word \"conservation\" as an environmental concept did not exist until the early twentieth century.[2] This concept to preserve actually grew out of the nascent conservation movement of the early the twentieth century, when President Teddy Roosevelt protected millions of acres of land by sheltering it in the National Parks and National Forests systems.[3] However, this desire to preserve our environment did not appear in Roosevelt's time without roots. In fact, events before the twentieth century laid the foundation for environmental conservation. The birth of the conservation concept actually began much earlier in the nineteenth century.\nIn the first half of the nineteenth century, the Industrial Revolution was at its height. The Revolution brought mass production and led people into more enjoyable lifestyles and increased consumption.[4] However, in the United States these changes had a very destructive impact on the environment.[5] Air and water pollution from coal-burning made cities like New York smoggy and dirty. Increased urbanization brought about increased water-borne diseases like cholera and typhoid. Moreover, hazardous materials released from factories devastated health conditions of working families who lived near industrial settings. The boom in transportation also led to serious land degradation.

Most people take chm220H1, but that course does not include a lab component, and it is quite difficult. What I did to remedy the problem was I redid my general chemistry course work at Ryerson University right next door. I've had very good experience with Ryerson. I took their CONTINUING EDUCATION courses at night. I took a half credit general chemistry lecture course (pure lecture course) CKCH106 (there's a follow up half credit course to CKCH106 that is also acceptable), followed by a half credit general chemistry lab course (pure labs) CKCH107. These 2 courses combined to give me 1 full credit of general chemistry, and they were acceptable to COMP. I might also add that while I was there, MANY UofT students were also there taking these 2 courses to fulfill their general chemistry credit requirement for US medical/dental/pharmacy schools. It was really quite something. Basically, a good fraction of those two chemistry classes at Ryerson were housed by UofT students. However, I can NOT guarantee if the MD/DO medical school in the US that YOU ARE applying to will accept these courses. I made sure these 2 credits were acceptable before taking them.

Half credit courses (0.5 credit) with lab are considered to have 4 credits, while half credit (0.5 credit) courses without lab are considered to have 3 credits . Basically, what this means is that Canadian schools do not give you 2 extra semester hours for labs in the courses.

(see the comprehensive exegetical papers on links at the end of this article that deal with all the relevant verses.) Since Jesus rebukes Nicodemus for being the teacher of Israel and not understanding in John 3:10-11, Jesus is pointing to Ezekiel 36:24-27. The water of John 3:5 points to the spiritual internal cleansing from the idolatry in Ezekiel 36:25 – \"I will sprinkle clean water on you, and cleanse you from all your idols\" . . . how? Ezekiel 14:3, 4, 7 speak of \"idols in the heart\". Water cannot cleanse the heart. But the Holy Spirit can. And it is by faith alone that the heart is cleansed. Acts 15:9 \"cleansing their hearts by faith\". I Peter 3:21 says that the \"baptism that saves\" is \"not the removal of dirt from the flesh\"; that is, is not an outward, physical thing, but an appeal to God for a good conscience\" – an internal thing, a crying out and Godly sorrow over sin and a repentance and faith in Christ. Acts 2:38 is using \"causal eis\" – the Greek preposition eis means here, \"because of\" or \"at\" – like in other places. One example of the \"causal eis\" usage is Luke 11:32 – \"they repented at the preaching of Jonah\", meaning, \"they repented because of the preaching of Jonah\". (Other places in the NT where the causal eis is used are: Romans 4:20; 11:32; Matthew 3:11; 12:41. See Dana and Mantey, Greek Grammar, pp. 103-104.\n\"I Ezekiel 36:24-27\n\nQuestion: In which century did Justin Martyr write and teach this doctrine?

{"text": "Oh by the way: Whither AMEX Traveler's Checks?\nMy Mom asked me the other day if anyone still uses American Express traveler's checks (or cheques if you're hoity-toity faux British.)\nBack in the dark ages of travel, say, in the 1970s/1980s, I remember going to get those checks before a trip. You took in cash (or one of those old-fashioned checks from your brick-and-morter bank,) paid for traveler's checks in the amount you wanted and then you slid them carefully in your wallet.\nIt was also a good idea to make a photocopy of them, or at least a list of the check numbers, so that if they were lost or stolen you could go into any American Express office and get them replaced.\nJust like that copy of your passport that goes in a separate place in your stuff in case the real one is stolen.\nYou do that, right?\nAnyway, the AMEX offices were an overseas Expat/Tourist Central, because not only could you go there to do financial stuff, but you could have your mail (snail, the only kind) sent there while you were traveling. It was your own personal post office, plus it had a clean bathroom, which was KEY in a lot of funkier places.\nWhy go through such hassle? Because, duh, there was no other way to get money!\nATMs were a new innovation and not yet widespread. I vividly remember the first time I stuck my ATM card into a machine in the United Arab Emirates, and local currency popped out.\nLocal Bongo Bucks, right there.\nIt was a total miracle.\nEveryone and their brother didn't take credit cards, either, so you needed traveler's checks to buy stuff.\nEven in today's plastic world, you still have to be careful about foreign currency and purchases, because banks are starting to tack on onerous fees for using overseas ATMs and for using your credit card overseas. It's sometimes called a \"currency conversion\" fee. If you travel overseas a lot, look for companies that don't do this to you.\n\nQuestion: What was another service provided by American Express offices for travelers? Answer: They served as a personal post office, allowing travelers to have their mail sent there while they were traveling.\n\nQuestion: What was a common issue with using traveler's checks?

{"text": "I, personally, had a penchant for rage. (I still do, but I'm more aware that, when I let it out to play, I get a toxic backlash and this is why, to this day, I have acid reflux.) So I just dream about it now, the old quickening of the heart, the feel of my body turning into The Alien, my teeth bared and snarling. I used to create situations to get yet another hit of that rage, and all of this is still embedded in my brain. I still get up almost every morning and scan for whoever I'm furious at. Who can I call and abuse? Even if it's a poor, innocent employee of a company that sent me the wrong-sized duvet. (I wanted a queen-size, not a single, for God's sake.)\nI especially love those calls because I can feel the salesperson quivering and trying to stay nice, which enrages me even more. Anger is my fingerprint, but the less I act on it, the less addictively feverish it becomes, like a memory that's fading. This doesn't mean I've turned beige, I still have the residue of fury up my sleeve, but now I use it only on occasions when my anger is appropriate, as in when someone's taking my parking space on purpose.\nJust as I've tried to stop my traffic-warden-attacking habit, you can change the long-term effect of your body's response to stress by learning to regulate your basic fight, flight and freeze reactions. Stress isn't always a response to an emergency or a disaster; it builds up from small day-to-day tensions there might be at your workplace, in your home life or your community, and can have long-term physical and mental consequences. Stress levels can also be made worse by a rich diet, by smoking, drinking alcohol … anything that whacks up your cortisol. The way in which a person interprets an event, along with their general state of physical health, is not determined completely by genetic factors but by behavioural and lifestyle choices. In other words, don't blame your mother for giving you the genes that led to your crack habit.\nType 2 Diabetes\nFor emergencies (fight or flight), we need to increase the level of glucose in our bloodstream to give us energy, but if the stress lasts too long the body can no longer take in the glucose and the result is diabetes. (Insulin regulates glucose and, when it depletes, the cells starve.)\nSo the thing that helps us in the short term becomes damaging over time. One bit of chocolate is good, but a chocolate fountain with a straw next to your bed isn't.\nObesity\nDuring a period of stress, as I mentioned above, the digestive system shuts down, because you need all your energy for flight or fight and there's no time to think about lunch. When sugar levels rise over time, insulin, as with diabetes, becomes resistant to glucose and glucose can't be absorbed. This means that you eventually end up on one of those TV shows where they need to take the roof off your house and have a helicopter airlift you out of your spaghetti-filled bed.\n\nQuestion: What is the author's current physical health issue due to past anger expression? Answer: The author has acid reflux due to past expressions of anger.\n\nQuestion: What is another long-term physical consequence of stress? Answer: Long-term stress can lead to obesity, as the digestive system shuts down during stress and insulin becomes resistant to glucose.\n\nQuestion: What is the author's favorite type of call to make? Answer: The author loves calls where they can feel the salesperson quivering, as it enrages them more.", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "15e912db-a6cf-4d27-bf5e-f146665de871", "url": "https://publicism.info/self_help/frazzled/4.html"}

Most anal cancers start from cells in the mucosa. Glands and ducts tubes leading from the glands are found under the mucosa. The glands make mucus, which acts as a lubricating fluid. Anal cancers that start from cells in the glands are called adenocarcinomas.

{"text": "How do you add depth to something like that? Castle fight has some depth with items you can buy and some units countering other units, but it all doesn't really help. The snowball dynamics are too strong. Another map, Preschool Tech Wars, tried to add depth by having a very complex upgrade tree. The first time you're playing, it is interesting to try to figure out which building requires which other buildings to upgrade. It also makes towers much stronger and that cuts the snowball short. (there are towers in Castle Fight but they're expensive and don't help against the really big snowball waves) It also adds heroes that you can control late in the game. Here is somebody playing it:\nThe problem this map has is that it always turns into a mess. Since you're able to stop the snowball by building towers, the game keeps on escalating until it turns into an unstoppable mess. This map was always less popular than Castle Fight because it adds complexity but runs into similar problems in the end. In terms of the Elo ladder that I talked above, Preschool Tech Wars might just have two rungs, like Tic Tac Toe. Because the outcome is such a mess that once you learn the basics, nobody is able to win against anyone else 90% of the time. Castle Fight is better in that regard.\nSo how else could you evolve this genre? If you know anything about it you're probably screaming at me because I haven't mentioned the biggest game: Direct Strike in StarCraft 2. It was one of the only two paid mods for StarCraft 2. (it was a thing Blizzard tried) Here is someone playing it:\nTo briefly explain how it works: Instead of building buildings, you have a board on which you directly place the units. Then the units get spawned each time that a wave starts. Also there are three players on each team, and the waves spawn one at a time from each player. So if you are player 2 on your team, your units will always spawn against the units of player 2 on the opposing team.\nHow does it solve the problems that Castle Fight has? Mainly by tightening everything up.\nCounters are much stronger, so if you see an opponent do something, you can build the counter and it will actually make a difference. (in Castle Fight you also kinda can, but since the counters aren't very strong, they get lost once the snowballing starts)\nThe lines are ridiculously short. Your units get to the other side very quickly. This prevents the snowball from building up. (also there are towers on the other side that end waves quickly)\nWaves come all at once. Combined with the short lane, this means that the fight for the previous wave is usually over by the time that the next wave comes through, once again reducing the snowball size.\n\nQuestion: How does 'Direct Strike' differ from 'Castle Fight' in terms of unit placement? Answer: Instead of building structures, units are directly placed on a board.\n\nQuestion: What did 'Preschool Tech Wars' try to do to add depth to the game? Answer: It introduced a complex upgrade tree for buildings, making towers stronger and adding controllable heroes.\n\nQuestion: Which game is mentioned as an example of a paid mod for StarCraft 2?

The thought may have crossed his mind once or twice (or a hundred times) but he refuses to entertain it because if it turns out he's completely reading the situation wrong it'll hurt more to realize Jimin doesn't, in fact, have feelings for him.\n\"Then why did he make out with you?\"\nJungkook frowns, gesturing vaguely with his chopsticks because how would he know? If there's one thing he's bad at it's figuring out what goes on inside Jimin's head ever.\n\"I told him I needed practice,\" he admits, shrugging. It's the only explanation he can come up with.\n\"Huh?\"\n\"I told him I had a crush on this guy and that I needed some practice before asking him out. That's the only reason why he kissed me.\" It sounds plausible even to his own ears.\n\"Wait.\" Taehyung blinks at him, ignoring the student passing by their table and greeting him. \"You've completely lost me there. There's another guy?\"\n\"No-\"\n\"What crush?\" Taehyung cuts him off, raising his eyebrows in feigned shock. \"Jeon Jungkook... Are you collecting men, now? New year, new me, is that what it is? You've finally decided to be a slut in 2021? Good for you.\" He shrugs in approval.\n\"Can you shut up?\"\n\"No,\" he breathes out dramatically, shaking his head. \"No, I can't.\"\n\"There's no guy. No crush. I lied to Jimin hyung.\"\n\"What? Why?\"\n\"I don't know, okay! I'm an idiot. I felt like kissing him so I came up with this stupid idea and now here I am.\"\n\"Oh, you evil man.\"\n\nQuestion: What does Taehyung ask when Jungkook says he lied about having a crush? Answer: \"What? Why?\"\n\nQuestion: What is Jimin popular for, according to Taehyung? Answer: Being a great lay but not kissing the people he sleeps with.\n\nQuestion: How does Jungkook describe himself after admitting he lied?

{"text": "If we assume that this is a reasonably accurate composite of most cargo culters, it is not too hard to examine it and pick out the hows and the whys. Why is easy. Cargo culting is the result of laziness. Larry Wall once wrote that one of the virtues of a programmer was laziness, but this is another kind of laziness. The laziness that Wall wrote about was a programmer who refused to do work that could be automated and, so, would put in extra work to save manual effort in the future. Cargo culting is based on a laziness, not of overall work, but of the mind. They cannot be bothered to think. They see something, but it would require straining the brain too much to understand it. If everyone took this approach to technology, we would still be pushing rocks around with our bare hands because no one would have seen the utility in investing in tools.\nWhat can those of us who care more do? Unfortunately, not much. Cargo culters got where they are through sheer sloth. If they could not be bothered to learn on their own, when computer books, articles, and resources are plentiful (or even just learn from the code they steal on a regular basis) there will not be much that you can teach them. Those who want to learn, learn more from having a knowledgeable person nearby. Those who do not, will not learn anything either way. In the final analysis, cargo culting is like any other form of laziness in business. It can only be handled by the person in question shaping up or shipping out.\nIt is sad because it is bad for everyone, whether they realize it or not. Businesses get sloppy, second rate software. Users get a tool that is often the bane of their very waking existence. Next-gen coders get headaches from trying to clean up the mess sufficiently to keep their own jobs. Finally, the cargo culters themselves get a bad time of it. The fruits of this mudball building cannot be hidden indefinitely, even if the cause of it can. The cargo culter may be fired, or leave under increasing pressure to maintain the impossible. In any event, they do not get the best they could have, had they built something well. Their own skills (what few they have) decrease in value, since the culter does not learn (if they did, they would not remain cargo culters) and keep up with an ever changing industry. So, just remember, when you see a cargo culter, you see a history of everyone involved losing.\n\nQuestion: What is the main reason behind cargo culting?

{"text": "I would say there's still kind of both, always new players coming and trying, and that's obviously a good thing, but I have also become more skeptical about other aspects. Prediction markets, one big problem or challenge, at least, is the zero sum nature with the token system, you have this non zero sum games, where everyone goes into a token and everyone gets rich, ideally value is greater and so on. With prediction markets, fundamentally you have markets that are zero sum markets, where someone needs to lose, and the question is who is losing. And the problem was always: you have information and you use this information and you make money, but you can only make money if someone else is losing. There are some answers to that and you have a political betting, where it's quite clear. And we saw in the last election that there was probably a decent amount of irrationality involved, which is, in a way, good for prediction markets, because it answers the question who's losing. It gives in a way, it funds those who potentially provide the valuable information. But in other markets, when you ask, when will Eth2 launch, and the question is who will be losing, who's the fish to finance the revealing of this useful information. And then some answers might be, or what people tried, is someone is willing to pay for this information, but that's not easy. So, I mean, who's paying a hundred thousand dollars to get this information, when then it's public. So those were just a few thoughts.\nAnna (00:09:21):\nThat's interesting. In that election example, I felt like that was one of the times where I saw the topic come up again, in a big way. I think people tweeting like, \"Look, look, they're predicting it correct\", while the results were still being counted, even though kind of predicted in a wonky way at the time, it was also swinging wildly back and forth, depending on what a newscast said. But what did you make of that experience, watching that in action? Was it promising for the concept in the future? Maybe once the tooling is there?\nMartin (00:09:52):\nYeah. Well, I mean, I would say it definitely was a moment, where actually some market activity happened and then definitely the surprising thing was how long after even the election happened. The odds for Trump still being elected or still whatever, winning, where at the surprising 10, 15, sometimes even up to 20%. And I think to some extent that can be explained by inefficiencies of the market set-up. So you would need to lock your capital specifically for market, denominated in stablecoin, then you might get best case, you might get a payout of 20% in timeframe of a few months, when at the same time DeFi craziness is happening and you can get 50% a year without any risk, why would you take the 20% with risk?\nTarun (00:10:51):\n\nQuestion: What was the maximum payout percentage mentioned for a prediction market?

She advocated for funding professional development opportunities for existing staff to learn more about supporting students. She continued, \"And I continue to believe that the dollars that we get should be used for all of our staff for staff development — some of that funding anyway.\"\nFreiheit said she understood. \"So we have to find that really good balance of, first of all, here are our immediate needs and they need to be met with additional staffing just to help with those particular pieces. Like … getting kids up to the grade level. They might be half a year or a full year behind and we have to get them up there,\" she said. The second part would be continuing to provide staff with training opportunities to grow in their roles, she said. \"If we have any positions that are added, we need to be very careful, first of all, that they're aware there could be a time limit on it.\" If the new programs or staff work very well, WAPS could consider changing its budget to maintain the program or position long-term, Freiheit said. \"Maybe that position is more effective than what's been done previously. So there might be some systems change that could come as a result of how we look at being innovative and different with how we do our work,\" she said.\nConversely, School Board member Karl Sonneman said he was not concerned about sustainability, in part because he feels education could look drastically different in a few years. \"This is in many ways a revolutionary period. And I think we spend so much time worrying about not being able to afford what we're going to see when we don't really know what we're going to see when we get there,\" he said.

The Swedes have a similar tradition called \"Fika\" which you may have heard about. It's a chance to catch up over a lovely piece of cake and a warm drink. There is nothing more heartwarming.\nWith such a focus on wellbeing rooted into the culture of a nation, there's no wonder the Danes rank so consistently highly on the world happiness charts and there is so much that we can learn from their wonderful lifestyle.

You're gonna probably figure out some other way forward, but your mind will catastrophize and give you an absolute all or none, black and white, horrifying kind of image if you're prone to that way of thinking. The problem with it is doing this logical thought doesn't mean that we're doing what's actually helpful. So for example, if you have an odd thought that came from your family of origin. Let's say, you're very self-critical of yourself, but when you really slow down and listen to it, yeah, that's mom's voice, and so you came by it honestly.

Well, these are goofy thoughts already. Maybe that's the last place you wanna focus. Maybe you wanna focus on your purpose and what you can actually do with behavior to do a better job of succeeding, etcetera. So, what's happened in CBT over time is that the core assumptions of the cognitive change methods that are inside classic CBT have been weakened, because the data don't suggest that they're the critical part of those collections. And so, along comes people like myself and the ACT work, except in [16:39] ____ memory therapy work with a really different perspective other than that classic idea that we have to catch our bad thoughts and get rid of them, umm, maybe not. Maybe we need to relate to them in a very different way.\nBrett McKay: So that's the big… Like from a big picture point of view, that's what makes ACT different from CBT. CBT is you're focused on those negative thoughts so you can challenge them, and then by challenging them, you'll overcome them.

{"text": "St. Paul begins this section of his letter by making an appeal to his apostleship. To be an apostle means that he is an ambassador of Jesus Christ. Part of being an ambassador means that he represents Jesus, not merely in terms of authority, but in this case, for the good of God's people. Paul's appeal to his apostleship, his ambassadorship, is so that the Corinthians would receive him as they would Jesus; particularly because he is there to bring God's grace.\nAnd as he does, Paul does not want them to be receiving the grace of God to no purpose. By receiving God's grace, Paul wants the Corinthians to be reconciled. To express what that means, Paul cites Isaiah 49:8.\nThis is Isaiah's proclamation concerning the Year of Jubilee. The Year of Jubilee would mean that land was to be given back to its original owners. It means that prisoners were to be released and set free. And that year, that season, is now.\nNow, Paul writes, is that favorable time. Now is the day of salvation. Now it is for you as it was for the people of Israel – that everything lost is returned. Now is that time that you prisoners are set free from the bondage of sin by God's grace.\nIn the same way that nothing could interfere with God's solemn decree of grace in the Jubilee Year, so now nothing ought to obstruct the grace of God in Christ for you. Part of God's grace, given through His ministers, includes their example, which is given to reflect God's own self-sacrificial character. The apostles, then, are pointing to Christ with words, but also with their suffering.\nAnd that, really, is key. Paul is not really boasting in what he is suffering. He is highlighting it because he wants to show that his ministry is a picture of Jesus ministry. His legitimacy comes not with impressive spreadsheets or worldly adulation. His ministry is marked with suffering that is meant to imitate Jesus' suffering.\nBefore Paul did anything for anyone in the Church, it was Jesus who had endured; Jesus who had been stricken, smitten, and afflicted; Jesus who endured the greatest hardship and calamity, the beatings of the Romans, the imprisonment of the tomb, the angry mob, nights spent in prayer, hunger in the wilderness.\nIt was Jesus who endured these things not merely by passing through them, but enduring them in perfect purity, in full knowledge of His mission, in patience with the impatient, kindness toward the unkind, led by His Holy Spirit with the only true love, made known in true speech and true power.\nThus the apostles imitate their Lord; they are pictures of His grace, and Paul does not want the Corinthians to receive that grace in an empty way. It would not only be a waste of Jesus' sufferings and their sufferings, it would profit them nothing.\n\nQuestion: What did Jesus endure according to Paul? Answer: According to Paul, Jesus endured beatings, imprisonment, angry mobs, nights spent in prayer, hunger in the wilderness, all in perfect purity and with patience, kindness, and love.", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "f835406a-15c5-41a4-a346-7ca566062afb", "url": "https://www.flc-boston.org/sermon-wednesday-lent1-3-4-20"}

And as we're going to see, they differ in quite interesting ways - beginning with the medium itself.\nJulian\nOur economy is a place where the reward to a seller is proportional to the level of skill with which a desire gets exploited. As nothing but a big exercise in unravelling human motivation, it proves the phrase follow the money to be the best guidance for anyone interested in the nature of our evolutionary urges. Seeking sexual relief (with a partner or in a self-sufficient manner) is one of them, having been responsible for the dawn of an industry focused on providing erotic stimuli for men and women alike. This profit-driven quest to maximally engage the consumer offers us the most honest portrayal of the things both sexes desire in each other.\nAnd as we're going to see, they differ in quite interesting ways.\nData is Beautiful\nBeing the sum of private consumers that we are, our actions reveal the common desires by sheer scale: As individuals we might be anonymous, but by doing the same things, we reveal what we have in common. What we're left with is a black box containing the collective desires of men and women. It's us who shone an unapologetic light on the less discussed facets of the human brain - 'cause the more we buy of something, the better it sells, and the less deniable it becomes that there's a biological motive for our appreciation of it.\nEnjoying any kind of erotic media in particular is an act of inconspicuous consumption, private to a degree that we tend to not openly talk about it. Without a third party observer levering any motivation to behave in a certain manner, they reveal pure, unaltered motivation. It's feeding your soul, without judging looks that comes with eating junk food.\nOne such example is men's infamously preferred way of finding company in solitude: Porn. Its overt, visual nature is particularly instructive for analyzing the psychology of mating. After all, the popularity of porn and its common motives don't leave much room for interpretation about what turns a man on: Men enjoy watching sexual explicit imagery, with a seemingly linear relationship between level of explicitness and sexual appeal. A truism evident in the ever expanding smörgåsbord of kinks and fetishes the internet sent upon us. Similarly undeniable is porn's economic scope, being an industry with an estimated worth of up to 97 billion dollars.\nThat's one side of the coin. Little did I know that this gift that keeps on giving is rivaled by its female equivalent, at least in its ability to create similarly outrageous amounts of money. Interestingly enough, the female analogue to erotic viewing pleasure isn't a slightly femcentric manifestation of the audio-visual. Instead, it's of the literary kind. We know it as theromance novel. And much like porn directors, authors creating this art subscribe to the profession of stimulating the arousal center of humankind.\n\nQuestion: What do men and women reveal about their common desires through their actions?

Prior to this, art. 193 of the CLT allowed the professional to choose which of the two would receive.\nAs the difference between unhealthy and dangerous is very tenuous, it often left room for loopholes, allowing employees to seek legal ways to acquire both.\nThus, the STF decreed a ban on the accumulation of additionals in 2021. Now, it is up to professionals to choose only one of them to receive, based on the criteria established by the Regulatory Norms.\nHow to calculate the unhealthy and dangerous premiums?\nIn order to determine the amount received in the unhealthy and dangerous premiums, it is necessary to know the degree of danger to which the professional is exposed.\nTherefore, the way of calculating the values ​​is different between unhealthy and dangerous. Each has its rules, check out:\nCalculation of unhealthy work additional\nThe unhealthy allowance is based on the minimum wage and the degree of risk to which the professional is exposed:\nthe degree minimum unhealthiness corresponds to 10% of the minimum wage;\nthe degree average unhealthiness corresponds to 20% of the minimum wage;\nthe degree maximum unhealthiness corresponds to 40% of the minimum wage.\nThus, for example, if a worker is exposed to a situation of maximum unhealthiness and the minimum wage is £ 1,100.00, he must receive an additional 40% under this amount, that is, 440 reais will be added to his wages monthly.\nCalculation of the hazard premium\nThe hazard premium is calculated according to the salary received by the professional. Thus, it is necessary to calculate 30% under the gross salary, which will be added to the monthly salary received.\nFor example, if an employee receives £ 2500 reais in gross salary, it is necessary to calculate 30% of that amount. Therefore, every month he will receive an increase of RS750.\n\nQuestion: What is the minimum unhealthy work additional for a professional exposed to the minimum degree of unhealthiness? Answer: 10% of the minimum wage.\n\nQuestion: Who is responsible for determining the conditions and levels of danger in a workplace? Answer: An Occupational Physician or Occupational Engineer.\n\nQuestion: Which professionals are entitled to the unhealthy work premium?

Many of the graduate jobs require computer literacy, adept communication skills, basic financial acumen, and general math. All these elements are integral in preparing a fresh entrant into the job market to consolidate key knowledge in the marketing which ultimately acts as a stepping stone to future specialized marketing career prospects.

{"text": "Are your door mats flame retardant?\nEveryone involved in the building industry is rightly paying more and more attention to the materials and processes being used, to make sure that buildings are as safe from fires as possible. This applies even more to multi-tenanted buildings like apartment complexes, retirement/nursing homes and supported-living sites. And it's important not to overlook choosing the right kinds of carpets, flooring and matting, as fire can spread quickly over these surfaces if they're not fire retardant. Non-fire-retardant entrance mats can help flames get out of control, as well as block exit points – presenting a serious risk to lives, belongings and property.\nTesting and classifications\nAny fire safety activity is centred around two main areas: reducing the likelihood of a fire starting, and preventing the spread of any fire that does get started. This might sound relatively simple, but the classifications and regulations can be complex. Classifications for fire-retardant materials are designed to help you make the right choice when selecting materials for your properties.\nInternational classifications are designed to ensure that any product or component with a classification marking has been tested to the same standards. Construction products should have been tested and graded against EN 13501-1, the European standard for reaction to fire. In the case of the 'fire retardant' marking, it means the materials have passed testing that includes exposure to a naked flame and a radiating heat source.\nFor floor coverings and mats the potential grades that can be awarded are:\nA1 fl – the 'fl' is an abbreviation for 'floor' and a floor covering with this rating is considered non-flammable with no risk of smoke formation\nB fl – flame-retardant product that has passed the radiating heat test with an intensity of 8kW/m2\nC fl – flame-retardant product that has passed the radiating heat test with an intensity of 4.5kW/m2\nA1 fl and A2 fl levels cannot be achieved by the vast majority of floor coverings, including vinyls and textiles. When you are looking for matting, you need to keep an eye out for B fl and C fl markings. These both mean that the mats have been tested and classified as fire retardant.\nIt's important to note that fire retardant does not mean the item cannot be set alight. It means that the materials used help to stop the spread of any fire that does manage to take hold.\nC fl classifications and below should be considered a fire risk. Using these products can present a danger to anyone in a building where they are installed.\nSmoke production\n\nQuestion: Which of the following is NOT a classification for fire retardant mats: A1 fl, B fl, D fl, C fl? Answer: D fl\n\nQuestion: Which of the following is NOT a goal of fire safety activities: Reducing the likelihood of a fire starting, preventing the spread of any fire that does get started, Extinguishing fires?

Merlin, in his infinite wisdom, has\nassured you that there is at least one way of dividing all the knights into two\nmeetings without any chance of duelling at either meeting.\nInput\nYour program should read from the file arthin.txt.\nThe first line of input will contain N, the number of knights.\nThe second line of input will contain P, the number of pairs of duel-prone knights.\nEach of the following P lines will contain two space-separated integers\na and b, representing two knights who cannot be invited to the same meeting. It is guaranteed that\na b and that the same pair will not appear twice in the input. Knights are labelled from 1 to N.\nOutput\nYour program should write to the file arthout.txt. It should\noutput a single integer: the maximum number of knights that can be invited to\nthe first meeting without any chance of a duel occurring at either the first or\nsecond meeting.\nSample Input\n8\n6\n1 2\n1 5\n3 2\n5 3\n6 8\n7 6\nSample Output\n5\nExplanation\nIn this example, Arthur can invite knights 2, 4, 5, 7 and 8 to the first\nmeeting and knights 1, 3 and 6 to the second meeting. There is no way for\nArthur to invite more than 5 knights to the first meeting without risking the\nchance of a duel between knights, so 5 is the correct answer.\nConstraints\nTo evaluate your solution, the judges will run your program against several\ndifferent input files. All of these files will adhere to the following bounds:\n1 ≤ N ≤ 100,000\n\nQuestion: What is the name of the output file that the program should write to?

Only thing impeachment will do is drive blue collar democrats away from the party.\nI think it comes down the fact that Democrats do not have a platform.

What we care about is finding a good job, healthcare, college education, fair and balanced trade… etc. Nobody cares about Russia or whats going on in the Ukraine.\nWhy is it so difficult for Democrats to simply address the issues? Go to the flyover states, talk to people, sit down with them, and listen. Rather than doing that Democrats want to force socialism down our throats.\nWhy was Donald Trump elected president?

{"text": "Gandhi's misguided approach can be seen in his advice to the British during the Second World War. As German rockets and bombs were raining down on them, he recommended the British use non-violent methods to fight Hitler. On December 24, 1938 he wrote, \"How can non-violence combat aerial warfare, seeing that there are no personal contacts? The reply to this is that behind the death-dealing bomb there is the human hand that releases it, and behind that still is the human heart that sets the hand in motion. And at the back of the policy of terrorism is the assumption that terrorism if applied in a sufficient measure will produce the desired result, namely, bend the adversary to the tyrant's will. But supposing a people make up their mind that they will never do the tyrant's will, nor retaliate with the tyrant's own methods, the tyrant will not find it worth his while to go on with this terrorism.\"\nBut that's not all.

{"text": "Property Taxes Rise Because of are struggling financially right now due to COVID-19, and that includes homeowners. Thankfully, there's been a fair amount of relief from mortgage lenders, many of which are letting borrowers impacted by the pandemic put their home loans into forbearance. Meanwhile, some municipalities are giving homeowners extra time to pay their property taxes.\nBut things aren't necessarily looking completely rosy on the property tax front. In fact, some homeowners could be facing higher bills in the aftermath of the pandemic.\nWill property taxes increase?\nTo be clear, property tax hikes are by no means a given, and it's easy to make the opposite argument -- in some areas, property taxes may go down due to COVID-19. Why so? These taxes are calculated by taking a home's assessed value and multiplying that number by the tax rate it's subject to. Since COVID-19 has already hurt the economy, it's fair to say that home prices could decline over time as a result, and once that happens, property taxes stand to fall.\nAt the same time, COVID-19 is putting a lot of municipalities under financial duress, as many are losing key sources of revenue. Some cities, for example, rely on income from parking fees to stay afloat. But with businesses largely shut down and more people staying home, residents are less likely to get in their cars and drive someplace that requires a parking fee.\nFurthermore, with so many people staying home, fewer traffic tickets are being issued. That may be a good thing from a safety standpoint, but those tickets serve as a revenue source -- one that cities may be desperate for right about now.\nAdditionally, a lot of municipalities are spending more money on public health initiatives because of the pandemic. And let's not forget schools -- there's a huge cost associated with remote learning, and one that existing budgets may not have the capacity to handle. And while it's still unclear what accommodations schools will need to make in the fall, one thing is clear -- someone is going to have to pay for them. Since property taxes are often essential to funding public schools, the solution could boil down to charging homeowners more. Some localities may not have a better option.\nRaising property taxes is clearly not a decision local officials will take lightly, and with so many people struggling to pay the bills, cities and towns that do so stand to bear the brunt of some really bad publicity. But if there's one thing COVID-19 has taught us, it's that when backed into a corner, we sometimes do things we never previously thought were reasonable.\nMost Americans never envisioned a time when children being schooled at home and wearing masks in public would become the norm. And so while it may seem like raising property taxes is a gloriously bad idea that could never actually come to be at a time like this, you just never\n\nQuestion: Which of the following is a reason why property taxes might increase, even if home prices decline?

Yoshi will be unable to eat them most of the time, and when he can, they won't disappear; instead, an empty green bush tile will appear a screen below the berry's actual position, and the berry itself can be eaten an unlimited number of times.\nWhen Yoshi eats a berry by running into it, the game will adjust Mario and Yoshi's position slightly during the freeeze to center him on the block. If the berry is placed close enough to a slope, this can be used to clip them into the slope.\nDismounting Yoshi while he's eating a berry will cause Mario to normal jump off instead of spinjump, despite still giving an X and Y speed as if he spinjumped.\nIf Yoshi ends inside a block without Mario riding him, he will \"climb\" the blocks upward until he reaches an empty block. This can occur as a result of growing Baby Yoshi inside the block, spawning a block on top of Yoshi, or clipping four pixels into the block and dismounting. Video\nIn the Japanese version of SMW, Yoshi is able to eat the jumping dolphins. This is not possible in any other release.\nIf a Baby Yoshi and adult Yoshi are spawned in the same level, Yoshi's head graphics will glitch and the game will have some strange effects. One effect in particular is that berries will not actually be eaten when Yoshi's head touches them; the game will keep registering him as eating it, but it will never disappear, letting you get an infinite number of berries.\nIf both Baby Yoshi and Yoshi eat the same item, Yoshi can still spit out the item, but it will have glitched properties. Strange effects can also occur from two Baby Yoshis eating the same items. This can additionally be used to create a null sprite.\nIf Baby Yoshi swallows multiple enemies consecutively, the game may register him swallowing an extra non-existant sprite; this can be used to grow a Baby Yoshi with only three sprites.\nWhile Baby Yoshi is swallowing a shell, it's actually just temporarily moved to the background rather than having sprite interaction disabled. This means you can use it to kill climbing Net Koopas behind a net from the in front of it.\nIf Baby Yoshi grows as he is eating a sprite, that sprite will be eat-canceled. This can also result as a side effect of eating multiple sprites consecutively, meaning, although you need at least three sprites for it, the last sprite may not actually be eaten.\nIf Baby Yoshi swallows a non-permanent sprite while far enough offscreen, the sprite will despawn as he is eating it.

{"text": "It's really quite simple. The Dead Sea Scrolls, Philo, Pliny the Elder, the Roman satirists, and all the other scores of contemporary sources are perfectly silent. All the near-contemporary sources are silent, too, though we start to get some Christians writing a generation or two afterwards. What those Christians wrote doesn't even pretend to have any bearing on reality; they're just bog-standard religious fiction.\nDoherty received a fair amount of criticism and was labeled \"un-scholarly\" by some for not exhaustively addressing main-stream historicist arguments in The Jesus Puzzle. Perhaps his 800+ page update is a response to that criticism.\nThough I've found Doherty convincing in the past, I'm also looking forward to Richard Carrier's 2-volume work on the subject due out sometime this year.\nMarella, thanks for responding. I'm actually not looking to determine whether there was a historical Jesus or not. Given the utter lack of evidence for a historical Jesus, I see no reason not to at least consider that the idea of a mythic Jesus is plausible and unrefuted.\nI take it that you have been convinced by reading Doherty that Jesus is only a mythic character. I don't have that Doherty book but I have the Jesus Puzzle. I confess I haven't got around to reading it yet but remember that it is arguing for something that I already expect is true. But, mythicists like Doherty, Price, Zindler, and Carrier all make an argument that I consider weaker than the simple minimal mythic position that the Jesus of the Christian bible is not a historical figure. They argue further that the myth itself arose organically from genuine religious movements, as opposed to being a deliberate and cynical construct.\nI think the possibility that it was a deliberate and cynical construction needs to be ruled out before we adopt the mythicist position being proferred by these writers. There is a certain implausibility of one particular version among the plethora gaining such dominance over the others so as to be adopted as an official religion of Rome, just on the basis of its merits. Many non-Christian people I know who argue for a historical Jesus are essentially arguing this implausibility. I take this to be support for the mythic variant that Christianity is a cynical invention. The idea that it was invented as a replacement religion for militant Judaism, which truly cost Rome dearly in treasure and prestige, provides an excellent justification for why it came to be dominant. It had a powerful sponsor, and was indoctrinated to generations of Roman slaves.\nI will have to hunt the link up but recently I saw somebody arguing very eloquently for that Christianity was invented by the Roman Flavians and yet this person seemed to have had no exposure to Atwill's book. There were bits of his or her argument that seemed contradictory to Atwill so I suspect this person arrived at the same hypothesis completely unaware that not only does it fit in many ways historically and circumstantially, but that also the inventors of Christianity apparently wanted their feat to be appreciated by posterity. So, the authors of Christianity left clear-cut evidence that they did the deed.\n\nQuestion: What is the title of the book by Acharya S that the author mentions? Answer: The author mentions \"The Christ Conspiracy\" by Acharya S.\n\nQuestion: What is one reason why the author finds the argument of some mythicists weaker?

Functions are one of the first-class citizens of Python, which means that functions are at the same level as other Python objects like integers, strings, modules, etc. They can be created and destroyed dynamically, passed to other functions, returned as values, etc. Python supports the concept of a nested function or inner function, which is simply a function.\nTo do that, pass the parameter using the ref or out keyword. For simplicity, the following examples use ref. Passing Reference Types by Value. The following example demonstrates passing a reference-type parameter, arr, by value, to a method, Change. Because the parameter is a reference to arr, i\n\nQuestion: Is Python pass-by-reference or pass-by-value? Answer: Python is pass-by-value in all cases, but the value is an object reference.\n\nQuestion: What is a Nested Function in Python? Answer: A nested function or inner function is a function defined inside another function in Python.\n\nQuestion: How can you print an object in Python? Answer: Python passes the object being printed to self in str, and whatever string this method returns is taken to be the print string for the object.\n\nQuestion: What happens when you pass an object to the add method in Python?

{"text": "There are three main slides that are used in paintball, the pop-up slide, the Superman slide, and the side slide. The pop-up slide is typically used to advance into a bunker in front of you or diagonally from you. To perform the pop-up slide, start running towards the bunker you want to reach, drop your rear leg to the ground, keep forward momentum and front leg pointing forward, stay sliding on your rear leg until you reach your destination. One of the great keys to successfully pulling this slide is to keep your head and marker up, not pointing to the ground. Once it reaches its bunker, it will suddenly pop out of its back leg and stand on its feet. This slide helps you fall out of sight of your opponents and travel to a new location very quickly. When done correctly, you should be on your feet when you get to the bunker ready to shoot your opponents whom you mistook by suddenly disappearing and then reappearing elsewhere. Defensively, the Pop-Up Slide is ideal for ducking under fire and getting behind the safety of a bunker.\nThe Superman Slide is often reserved for players trying to enter the snake-shaped bunker. This slide usually comes out of pause as soon as you hear the buzzer. Start the Superman Slide by running towards the snake, again keeping your head and gun up as you run. As you approach the bunker, begin to squat down and slowly move your center of gravity toward the ground, sliding into a slide across the front of your belly; DO NOT jump and land upside down. When you start to fall forward, make sure your gun's air tank is under your armpit, NOT directly over your shoulder or it could cause injury like a dislocation. When you are level with the ground, extend your forearms toward the ground, sliding them toward the snake. This slide helps you get into the snake as quickly and efficiently as possible. When entering the snake on a superman slide, it is important to avoid sticking the barrel of your marker into the ground. If your barrel digs into the ground, it can damage your weapon or, at the very least, block the barrel with dirt. To prevent this from happening, try keeping your palms up towards the sky. This may seem a bit awkward at first, but practice will make it more natural.\nThe side slide is best used for maneuvering into bunkers that are horizontal to you. To perform the Side Slide, move left or right in the direction of the bunker you want to reach. As you approach the bunker, drop your back leg to the ground while keeping your front leg sideways toward the bunker. Stay gliding until you reach the bunker, then lift your rear leg up and off the ground. You can also use the heel in front of you to slow down as you approach the bunker you are sliding into. This slide is similar to the pop-up slide in all respects except the front leg orientation; in the side version, your front leg should point to the side you are sliding. Use this maneuver to evade incoming fire and move faster towards the bunker without being hit.\n\nQuestion: What is the purpose of the Superman slide? Answer: To enter the snake-shaped bunker quickly and efficiently\n\nQuestion: What should you avoid doing while performing the Superman slide?

That is why the success rate of several people trying to quit smoking continues to be so high.\nHowever, there's another option, and it's really called \"vaping\" rather than smoking. There are different ways to get this done, and it's more popular on a regular basis. You should consider the pros and downsides of vaping when you're trying to stop smoking.\nSo, to begin with, if you are still making use of cigarettes, you might have observed that if you want to smoke a cigarette, there's a certain way you will need to carry it.

Many smokers try to do this, however when they get accustomed to it, it will become a little bit less complicated.\nWith an e-cigarette, the controls in different ways work just a little. They're called \"mods\", and you can adjust the nicotine level in the device by changing the resistance setting within the atomizer.\nBy achieving this, you can adjust the amount of nicotine in the vapor, making the complete outcomes of your puff a lot more enjoyable. By taking a puff after you have adjusted the nicotine level in these devices, you can actually feel an excellent sense of satisfaction and relaxation.\nOnce you have a comfortable setting for you, you should set the nicotine level to around 2% (I would say it's much more enjoyable to vape at around 1% to 2%). You'll experience a better feeling of handle over yourself, which is the main reason that vaping is indeed much more productive than smoking.\nOne thing that has been observed concerning the success of vaping is definitely that the majority of people report they have tried other methods and \"cured\" their addiction to smoking making use of e-cigarettes. Some people even say that they've actually gone through an interval of living without smoking cigarettes.\nWhen you make an effort to quit smoking with a normal method, a lot of people shall feel the physical effects of withdrawal, which can be uncomfortable and experience dependency incredibly. With e-cigarettes, a lot of people report they have experienced very little physical discomfort, and that they haven't experienced any addiction whatsoever.\n\nQuestion: Which part of the cigarette do smokers typically hold with their finger to adjust nicotine level? Answer: The top of the cigarette\n\nQuestion: What is the term used to describe the process of using an e-cigarette?

{"text": "Although many different types of tattoo machines are available on the market these days, most artists find themselves choosing between two models, picking either a dual coil machine or a rotary machine. Yes, they both achieve the same purpose, but the way they drive their respective needles in and out of a client's skin, as well as their versatility, is what sets them apart from one another.\nRotary vs. Dual Coil Machines\nIn a nutshell, dual coil machines are plugged into a power supply and rely on electromagnetic current passing through two coils to function. Once said current is flowing, it releases the armature bar holding the needle(s) down into the skin. The electromagnetic field is then broken and the armature bar is lifted back up by a spring, thus returning to its original position. This cycle then repeats again and again, allowing the artist to tattoo their client, as the needle rises and falls in a hammer-like motion.\nMeanwhile, rotary machines rely on a motor that rotates clockwise to drive the needle bar up and down in a more smooth, even manner. That being said, dual coil machines seem to be the more popular (and affordable) choice among modern-day artists. This is changing, however, as tattooers are starting to embrace the added perks that come along with rotary machines. But more on those later! First, let's take a look back at the history of the tattoo machine.\nThe Evolution Of Rotary Machines\nDespite their differences, both the dual coil and rotary machine have the same Thomas Edison invention to thank for their existence: the Autographic Printing Pen. Yes, we're talking about the same Thomas Edison who also gave us the phonograph, motion picture camera and electric light bulb!\nSamuel O'Reily patent 1891\nIt was 1891 when tattooer Samuel O'Reilly invented and patented the first-ever electric tattoo machine, which was similar in design to today's rotary machines. Taking Thomas Edison's 1876 invention, known as the Autographic Printing Pen, and modifying it, he arrived at history's very first tattoo machine.\nAt the time, the Autographic Printing Pen was used by businesses as a time-saving tool, which allowed them to create copies of documents quickly and efficiently. Basically, the pen had a high-speed electric motor and a thick steel needle that was used to make holes in a paper, which would then be used as a stencil. Ink would be rolled over the perforated paper and the design would appear on a blank page that was placed underneath it. Simple but totally brilliant, right?\nUnfortunately, the pen turned out to be way too heavy for extended use, so Edison took out the battery and presented the world with the revamped Perforating Pen in 1878. This updated version worked like a sewing machine and was powered by pressing a pedal. Just a few weeks later came the Edison Pneumatic Stencil Pen, which, as Britishink ( describes, used \"air pressure, gas or a liquid that could turn a fan system and drive the needle bar, making the machine lighter and easier to use than the previous incarnations.\"\n\nQuestion: What was the original purpose of the Autographic Printing Pen?

{"text": "COURSE DESCRIPTION: Introduction to Video Game Design will take a hands-on journey through the process of creating a third-person video game, from initial idea to functioning prototype. Students in the course will explore character, narrative, and level design; consider how game mechanics influence story (and vice versa); model various asset production pipelines; get comfortable with game logic and learn to build the systems contemporary games require; and consider the various avenues available to independent developers for getting their games into the hands of their players.\nSUMMARY OF COURSE CONTENT: For nearly a decade the video game industry has generated more revenue than the film and music industries combined, a trend that appears likely to continue for the foreseeable future. And as the industry has grown, so too has the variety of experiences to which games expose their players: from the Kafkaesque nightmare of customs officer simulator \"Papers, Please\" to the existential dread and dystopian paranoia of \"Limbo\" and \"Inside\" to the surreal pastoral of \"Goat Simulator\" contemporary games are often as interested in provoking their audiences to question their easy certainities and unarticulated biases as they are in encouraging the next in-app purchase.\nIntroduction to Video Game Design is a project-based course whose structure is modelled on the stages of independent game development. In the \"research\" stage the course will examine different genres, styles, controls, as well as consider strategies for market evaluation. The course will then move on to preparation of a game design document before plunging into asset development, the implementation of controls, game mechanics and systems, visual effects, and audio, before finally addressing the design and implementation of user interface elements (including menus), and discussing the qualities (\"polish\") that help distinguish a game in a space that grows more crowded by the hour.\nThere will be homework assignments nearly every week that aim to reinforce the material covered in class, provide additional context for development practices and industry organization, and create a firm foundation for the development of the student's final project.\nThe course will use Unreal Engine for its development environment with Blueprints visual scripting.\nRequired course materials/study visits and expected expenditure for the students. Although we will be working on the Macs in the lab during class students MUST have their own computers with 8GB of RAM and a discrete graphics card at an ABSOLUTE MINIMUM. 16GB+ of RAM and Nvidia GTX1060+/AMD 570+ are recommended.\nWe will be using Blender, Unreal Engine, Quixel Mixer, and Photoshop in the class. Blender is free. Students who do not have access to Photoshop are free to use GIMP, an open-source alternative. Unreal is free. Quixel is also free, although you will need to set up your Unreal account prior to activating it.\nLEARNING OUTCOMES: By the end of the class students should be able to:\n• develop a viable game idea and present it through a comprehensive game design document\n• design and produce appealing assets for their chosen genre\n• source and customize free, public domain, and CC0 assets for use in their games\n\nQuestion: Which game is an example of a game that provokes its audience to question their biases? Answer: \"Papers, Please\"\n\nQuestion: Which of the following is NOT a learning outcome of the course?

{"text": "Bible Question:\nWhat is the time frame between Genesis 4:16 and 4:17? I was asked how could Cain have a wife when he and his parents were the only ones on the earth?\nBible Answer:\nCain's Wife\nWho was Cain?\nCain was the first child of Adam and Eve recorded in Scripture (Genesis 4:1). His brothers, Abel (Genesis 4:2) and Seth (Genesis 4:25), were part of the first generation of children ever born on this Earth.\nCain's Brothers and Sisters\nEven though only these three males are mentioned by name, Adam and Eve had other children. In Genesis 5:4 a statement sums up the life of Adam and Eve—'And the days of Adam after he had fathered Seth were eight hundred years. And he fathered sons and daughters.' This does not say when they were born. Many could have been born in the 130 years (Genesis 5:3) before Seth was born.\nDuring their lives, Adam and Eve had a number of male and female children. The Jewish historian Josephus wrote that, 'The number of Adam's children, as says the old tradition, was thirty-three sons and twenty-three daughters.'11\nThe Bible does not tell us how many children were born to Adam and Eve. However, considering their long life spans (Adam lived for 930 years—Genesis 5:5), it would seem reasonable to suggest there were many! Remember, They were commanded to 'Be fruitful, and multiply' (Genesis 1:28).\nThe Wife\nIf we now work totally from Scripture, without any personal prejudices or other extra-Biblical ideas, then back at the beginning, when there was only the first generation, brothers would have had to have married sisters or there would be no more generations!\nWe are not told when Cain married or any of the details of other marriages and children, but we can say for certain that some brothers had to marry their sisters at the beginning of human history.\nObjections\nGod's Laws\nMany people immediately reject the conclusion that Adam and Eve's sons and daughters married each other by appealing to the law against brother-sister intermarriage. Some say that you cannot marry your relation. Actually, if you don't marry your relation, you don't marry a human! A wife is related to her husband even before they marry because all people are descendants of Adam and Eve—all are of 'one blood.' The law forbidding marriage between close relatives was not given until the time of Moses (Leviticus 18–20). Provided marriage was one man to one woman for life (based on Genesis 1 and 2), there was no disobedience to God's law originally when close relatives (even brothers and sisters) married each other.\nRemember that Abraham married his half-sister (Leviticus 18–20). God blessed this union to produce the Hebrew people through Isaac and Jacob. It was not until some 400 years later that God gave Moses laws that forbade such marriages\n\nQuestion: When was Cain's wife first mentioned in the Bible?

{"text": "How a Healthy Diet Can Improve Your Dental Health!\nWhen you think about ways to keep your teeth\nhealthy and strong, the first thing that comes to mind is probably brushing\nyour teeth twice a day. However, aside from your oral hygiene routine, what you\neat and drink plays a major role in the health of your teeth and mouth.\nTo ensure your dental health is in the best condition, it's vital to maintain a healthy diet that provides the vitamins and nutrients your teeth need. Here are our top tips for keeping on track with your oral health by eating a healthy, balanced diet.\nTips for a Teeth-Friendly Diet:\nConsume\nenough calcium\nHaving enough calcium in your diet is an\nimportant factor for good dental health. Aside from strengthening the teeth,\ncalcium also repairs damaged enamel. You can find calcium in dairy products\nsuch as milk and cheese, as well as in certain plant-based foods.\nIf you don't think you're getting enough\ncalcium in your regular diet, you can talk to your doctor about calcium\nsupplements to ensure you're getting the right amount of this important\nmineral.\nEat a\nbalanced, healthy diet\nMaking sure your diet includes plenty of vegetables and fruit will help to provide the vitamins and nutrients you need for healthy teeth. You should also aim to eat complex carbohydrates, which include foods such as grain bread. These type of carbohydrates release energy more slowly, which keeps you fuller for longer - meaning you're less likely to reach for the snack jar.\nAside from the food you eat, you should also aim to drink plenty of water. Drinking water helps to keep your mouth hydrated, as well as washing away bacteria and acids to prevent these from building up on your teeth.\nDon't forget healthy fats\nDid you know that not all fats are bad for you? Foods such as salmon and oily fish like sardines contain 'good fats' that are great for your teeth, as well as being naturally rich in teeth-friendly vitamin D.\nLimit\nyour sweet treats\nDon't worry, we're not suggesting you give up your favourite sweet snacks altogether, but keeping those sugary treats to a minimum will help reduce oral health problems such as tooth decay.\nIt's also important to be aware that certain sweets can be worse for your teeth than others. For example, chewy lollies that stick to the teeth's surface will keep them covered in sugar for longer.\nSwap your snacks\nIf you find your sweet tooth cravings are kicking in a little too often, you might find it useful to swap your usual sugary treats for healthier, more teeth-friendly options. Try chopping up some crunchy veg like carrots and celery, or opting for some healthy but delicious nibbles such as nuts or crackers - perfect for afternoon snack attacks!\nCut\nback on 'teeth stainers'\nCertain foods and drinks can result in the\nstaining or discolouring of your teeth, so it's best to reduce your intake to\navoid a yellow-looking smile. This includes beverages such as tea, coffee, and\n\nQuestion: Which food group is NOT mentioned as part of a teeth-friendly diet? A) Vegetables B) Fruits C) Red meat Answer: C) Red meat\n\nQuestion: Which type of carbohydrates are recommended for a teeth-friendly diet? Answer: Complex carbohydrates\n\nQuestion: What does drinking water help to do for your mouth?

Is Blowfish still in use? Why is it in use, or why is it not in use? What type of cipher is Blowfish? What is the key length of Blowfish? Why would the Twofish cipher be chosen over Blowfish? Why would Blowfish be chosen over DES or IDEA?\nTwofish succeeded blowfish and was also designed by Schneier. Read the section on the twofish cipher to learn about the length of the algorithm, and the types of environments where twofish can be used.\nPreviously you learned about asymmetric key algorithms and you should understand that asymmetric encryption requires two keys: public and private. As a review, using the flashcards define asymmetric key encryption, public key, private key, and digital certificate. Then read the section on asymmetric encryption.\nDo you find asymmetric encryption and the use of a public and private key difficult to comprehend or explain? This video will explain asymmetric encryption, or non-secret encryption, and leads into RSA the first symmetric algorithm. Watch this video for a visual explanation of asymmetric encryption and RSA. On what principle is RSA based? Make note of the year RSA was developed and why it is called RSA.\nRSA is an asymmetric algorithm and is attributed to three people but reading this article will explain who developed the algorithm years earlier. When reading this article, try to understand the section on key generation, encrypting messages, decrypting messages, and signing messages. Most importantly, note the speed of RSA in comparison to DES that was discussed in the section on symmetric key encryption. Also note how attacks such as man-in-the-middle and RSA blinding attacks can be avoided.\nDigital signature algorithm (DSA) is used for authentication and is considered a signature algorithm. When reading section three of this article, pay the most attention to the steps in the scenario with Alice and Bob on how to obtain a digital signature using a private and public key, and how a digital signature verification is produced. To keep a basic idea on a timeline, also pay attention to the year that DSA was proposed. Attempt to follow through the reading on DSA key generation, signature generation, and signature verification although you are not expected to be able to explain these steps.\nPretty good privacy, known as PGP, is an open-source program that provides data encryption and is often used for email. This program uses a public and a private key for encryption and decryption, as you might expect. Read this article to understand how you can use PGP to encrypt email sent from your personal computer.\nNow that you understand how PGP can be used, read this article to learn who developed PGP while taking note of the year it was developed. Be sure to read the sections on how PGP works as well as the encryption-decryption process using the public and private keys. As you will notice, the public keys versions are RSA that was previously discussed, and Diffie-Hellman that will be discussed in a later section.\n\nQuestion: Is Blowfish still in use today? Answer: Yes, it is still used in some applications.\n\nQuestion: Why would Blowfish be chosen over DES or IDEA? Answer: Blowfish is faster and more secure than DES, and it has a larger key size than IDEA.", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "d6fd5f53-679e-468c-940d-f071683a10ce", "url": "https://learn.saylor.org/course/resources.php?id=453"}

The more we know about students, the more we can support them equitably.\nEmpathy, not Sympathy\nSympathy includes distance, protecting ourselves from feeling what another person is feeling. Empathy requires being present in the moment and feeling what the other person is feeling, accepting their feelings within yourself, and understanding their experience from their perspective, not your own.

A deep vein thrombosis can worsen, or a fragment of a clot can come off and settle in the lungs, causing pulmonary embolism.\nTreatment for deep vein thrombosis is determined by the size of the clot, the person's symptoms, and their health conditions. Anticoagulation is used to prevent clots or to lessen the size of existing clots.\nHypertension of the portal veins[edit]\nThe portal veins run through the abdomen and transport blood to the liver. Cirrhosis, or liver illness, is linked to portal hypertension, as are other disorders including an obstructive clot (Budd Chiari syndrome) or pressure from tumors or TB lesions. Collateral circulation occurs as the pressure in the portal veins rises, resulting in visible veins like oesophageal varices.\nIs oxygen present in venous blood?\nVenous blood is often cooler and has a lesser oxygen level and pH than arterial blood. It also contains lower glucose and other nutritional contents and greater urea and other waste material concentrations.\nContraindications:\nThere are no absolute contraindications.\nContraindications that are related\nInfection or hematoma at a potential venipuncture site\nInjured or grossly edematous extremity\nThrombotic or phlebitic vein\nIntravenous catheter distal to a prospective venipuncture site.\nIn the cases mentioned above, venipuncture should be done at a different site. Coagulopathy is not really a contraindication, although, after venipuncture, the sites must be squeezed for a longer period of time.\nLocal infection\nArterial puncture\nHematoma or bleeding\nDamage to the vein\nNerve damage\nVasovagal syncope is one of the more typical complications.\nTake a blood sample:\nAfter the tourniquet is placed, try to get to the vein quickly and obtain the blood test within 30 seconds. The tourniquet should not be worn for more than one minute.\nReapply the tourniquet close to the insertion place you choose. Patients should not make a fist or allow their arms to drop down during blood collecting since these actions can result in erroneous laboratory results\nUsing your gloved finger, palpate the center of the target vein.\n\nQuestion: Which of the following is NOT a cause of deep vein thrombosis? A) Immobility B) Aggressive malignancy C) Inherited abnormalities D) Common cold Answer: D) Common cold.", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "5ca85dab-821c-4d0b-a5c7-780ecf6e71a4", "url": "https://medshelper.com/veins/does-venous-blood-return-to-heart/"}
{"text": "But its name is no longer Laurelindórenan but Lothlórien. It has become the Dreamflower or even just Lórien, or Dream Land. Later Treebeard will speak of this to Merry and Pippin.\n\"Now they make the name shorter: Lothlórien they call it. Perhaps they are right; maybe it is fading, not growing. Land of the Valley of Singing Gold, that was it, once upon a time. Now it is the Dreamflower.\"\nThe dream that the Fellowship will enter will still be potent, still intoxicating, and perhaps just a little frightening, very frightening for those who bring their peril with them as Sam will later put it to Faramir in Henneth Annûn. But it is a land that is falling asleep, \"fading, not growing\". Tolkien skilfully shows a world that is still saturated with the myth of Eden. Like Legolas we cry with yearning, \"My heart would be glad if I were beneath the eaves of that wood, and it were springtime!\" or with Aragorn, \"My heart will be glad, even in the winter\", but as we read The Lord of the Rings we come to realise that there is no return to Eden, that if there is to be a place for us, somewhere, then it lies before and beyond us. As Aragorn will say to Arwen Undómiel at his own ending, \"In sorrow we must go, but not in despair. Behold! we are not bound for ever to the circles of the world, and beyond them there is more than memory.\"\nThe Fellowship of the Ring by J.R.R Tolkien (Harper Collins 1991) pp.236-239\nIt was the Elven-smiths of Eregion who gave Sauron the knowledge that he required to forge the One Ring. It was not that Celebrimbor was an ally to Sauron in his desire for the mastery of Middle-earth but that and his co-workers failed to perceive the true motives of the one they knew as Annatar. At this stage of his career Sauron was able to appear in a fair guise. That is one reason why Celebrimbor was deceived. But much more importantly he was deceived because of what he shared in common with the one who would become his deadly foe. He like Sauron had an eagerness for knowledge and this is what lead to his ultimate ensnaring.\nAn imagining of the friendship between Celebrimbor and Sauron/Annatar\nOr so Tolkien the narrator relates that Elrond affirms in his speech to the Council in Rivendell. And I think that we must assume that Tolkien agrees with what Elrond says here for in saying this Elrond confirms the way in which the story of Sauron is told throughout the legendarium, the complete works of Tolkien regarding his mythical world. Sauron is always presented as a character who desires order and control above everything and what is always necessary if anyone is to achieve order is to possess knowledge. Without the possession of knowledge order is an impossibility.\n\nQuestion: What is Sauron's ultimate desire, according to Elrond? Answer: Order and control", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "9f34ef31-4c68-4d86-9fdd-912ca4da9016", "url": "https://stephencwinter.com/tag/the-valar/"}
{"text": "The T-34/41 was a significantly improved version of the T-34, introducing an improved F-34 76mm tank gun, new two-piece cast turret, the use of welding, and a number of other modifications. Perhaps one of the most interesting was the addition of railings, giving allied infantry an easier time riding the tank. Its off-road capabilities were better than most trucks and were commonly used by Soviet troops to advance, despite the danger.\nOT-34[]\nThe OT-34 was a flamethrower conversion of a regular T-34 armed with the F-34 gun. Much like the Crocodile, it replaced the hull machine gun with a flamethrower, the ATO-41, but unlike its British analogue, the fuel tank was carried inside the hull.\nT-34E[]\nBy 1944, old models were surplus, although some were fitted with additional armor plates welded on the turret and elsewhere, to give it improved protection. This unofficial modification was called sekranami (with screens).\nT-34/76 obr. 1942[]\nAn updated model introduced in 1942, offering slightly better armor protection, numerous production improvements to simplify manufacture, and an overhauled track and wheel design. Additionally, it received a new driver's hatch and a round transmission access cover.\nFlakpanzer T-34(r): A field modification of a 1943 model T-34/76 created by Werkstattkompanie 653 (workshop company of Panzerjager Abteilung 653), 2cm Flakvierling auf Fahrgestell T-34(r) or the Flakpanzer T-34(r) combined a 20mm Flakvierling 38 with the durable chassis of a T-34. Protection was provided by armored plates salvaged from damaged half-tracks, with ammunition carried in racks at the back of the chassis. This single unique vehicle served with the command company of the battalion.\nT-34/85 obr. 1943[]\nThe 85 model was the ultimate expression of Soviet efficiency and pragmatism in warfare. Where the Nazis responded by creating entire new breeds of tanks, like the Tiger or Panther, the Soviets countered them by simply adding more gun to the T-34. The 85mm D-5T tank gun was a derivative of the M1939 (52-K) anti-aircraft gun, bridging the firepower gap. More importantly, it was mounted in a new, three man turret, greatly improving the battlefield performance of the T-34. The resulting tank would continue to serve well beyond the end of the war in all armies of the Communist bloc, until the introduction of next-generation Soviet armor.\nT-34/85 obr. 1944[]\n\nQuestion: Which feature did the T-34/41 introduce that made it easier for allied infantry to ride the tank?

{"text": "As you can see, the adjective is used to modify the pronouns ('he', 'she', 'it'). It describes a quality about the person or thing, however, it does not specifically state what is being described.

But it also gives us the creative control to design innovative devices that are perfectly tailored to your specific wants, needs, level of amputation, and goals. Our mission is to help you get back to living the way you want. And to us, that means doing more than just delivering you the right device – but connecting you to our amputee community and any resources you need to get back the life you want. We are here to help!\nThe Components of Lower Limb Prosthetics\nI've had other prosthetics before, and this was really life-changing because the fit is so comfortable. The technology of the feet is accelerated to the point where, if I have pants on, you can't tell I have a prosthetic leg.\nLower limb prosthetics are typically made up of a socket, suspension, pylon, and foot. Depending on the level of amputation, however, additional components, such as a knee joint and hip joint, may be necessary.\nA socket is the place where your residual limb will reside. Much of a prosthetist's experience and skill go into creating a custom socket, as its fit is critical to the comfort of your prosthesis. Every socket must be custom-designed for each patient and then adjusted as necessary for maximum comfort and functionality.\nThe suspension is the component or method that is used to secure the prosthesis to the residual limb when you are walking or running. There are many different suspension methods, with the three most common being: vacuum, shuttle lock, and passive suction. Multiple suspension units can be used at the same time, depending on the level of amputation and needs of the patient. For more information, including the pros and cons of each, check out Ottobock's overview of these suspension methods here.\nThe pylon is a structural piece of a prosthesis that acts much like the shin bone, connecting all of the different components of the prosthetic leg together. The pylon is responsible for transferring the load of body weight to the foot and the floor.\nThe foot you choose for your prosthetic will depend on your individual goals. There are many options available – and each style of foot performs different functions. Check out the following resource for more information on the types of feet available, including the advantages and disadvantages of each.\nFor more information on knee units and hip joints, see sections below covering above-knee prosthetics, including knee disarticulation, hip disarticulation, and hemipelvectomy amputation.\nAlignment of Lower Limb Prosthetics\nThe alignment of a lower limb prosthesis refers to the position of the socket in relation to the foot and knee. Much like the design of the socket, proper alignment takes a lot of skill, expertise, and experience – and is absolutely critical to the fit, comfort, and functionality of your prosthetic leg. Alignment happens before you try your prosthetic on, then again during your first fitting, and often continues throughout the rehabilitation process to ensure a perfect fit.\nLimb Loss Below the Knee – Transtibial Prostheses\n\nQuestion: Which of the following is NOT a factor considered when designing lower limb prosthetics? A) Specific wants B) Level of amputation C) Favorite color D) Goals Answer: C) Favorite color\n\nQuestion: What is the primary benefit of having lower limb prosthetics built and adjusted in-house?

{"text": "Introduction\nMedicaid is a US government program meant to uplift the standards of healthcare service provision for low income and poor families in America. It is probably one of the largest healthcare programs in the United States, at least on the basis of offering health services to low income and poor families (Blendon, 1993, p. 133). The program works by assessing the needs of the target population and determining their eligibility to enter the program.\nMedicaid is usually run by state governments but its budget is overwhelmingly funded by the US federal government. The program is also unique to American citizens only, and it may stretch to dependants of eligible candidates, or people with disabilities, who fit within the admission criterion.\nMedicaid has been in existence since 1965, through the provision of a social security act, meant to enable poor citizens in America get quality healthcare services (Gold, 2011, p. 1). Joining Medicaid is not a federal requirement because states have the option of declining or accepting the program.\nSeveral states operate the program under different names; for example, California refers to the Medicaid program as \"Medi-cal\", Massachusetts refers to the program as \"Masshealth\", Tennessee refers to its program as \"Tenncare\", and many other states use different names to represent the Medicaid scheme (Blendon, 1993, p. 133).\nSome states also run the program alongside other health programs, such as the Child health insurance program, to improve the efficiency of healthcare services, while other states subcontract the program to private companies, which run the program or offer the program's services to a state's citizens, on its behalf. Since the Medicaid program is operated on a large scale, and every state has subscribed to it, it greatly affects the quality of healthcare services in America.\nIndeed, the program touches a lot of American lives. Due to this reason, this study analyses the program in detail by studying the social problems. The program was initially intended to address; defining the target population of the program; characterizing the services provided in the program and defining its source of funding; defining the role of social workers in the program; evaluating the success of the program and suggesting possible policy changes which could be made to improve the program. These elements of study will be analyzed systematically.\nSocial Problem to be addressed\nMedicaid was designed to address several social challenges in America. One of such challenge was the inability of low-income people in America to get good healthcare services because of their inability to pay for quality healthcare. Most of the people targeted for the program were American citizens (and their dependents) who lived in poverty (Gold, 2011, p. 1).\nThe program therefore helps this population group to partially or fully pay for healthcare. To a large degree, poverty was the greatest motivator to start the Medicaid program because America has in the past been dealing with the social burden of providing quality life (including healthcare) to people living in poverty.\n\nQuestion: What is the primary funding source for the Medicaid program? Answer: The US federal government.\n\nQuestion: When was the Medicaid program established? Answer: 1965.\n\nQuestion: Who is the Medicaid program primarily designed to help? Answer: Low income and poor families in America.\n\nQuestion: Which of the following is NOT a way states operate the Medicaid program? A) Running it alongside other health programs B) Subcontracting it to private companies C) Requiring all citizens to join Answer: C) Requiring all citizens to join.", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "f2158831-1dd4-4241-b0bd-2e86bb6df454", "url": "https://ivypanda.com/essays/medicaid-government-medical-program/"}

{"text": "The rise in monkey-malaria infections among humans comes at a time when scientists are increasingly concerned about the effect of land clearing on disease spread. It could be making it easier for some simian infections to jump between macaques and humans, they say: closer proximity to macaques increases a person's chances of getting bitten by mosquitoes infected with malaria. \"Malaria parasites can be promiscuous in their host specificity,\" says Richard Culleton, a malaria scientist at Nagasaki University in Japan. \"They sometimes jump around.\"\nA 2016 study3 at the northern tip of Borneo found a high incidence of P. knowlesi among humans in villages that had cleared some of the forest surrounding them. Study leader Kimberly Fornace, a malaria researcher at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, says macaques moved closer to human settlements after their forests were felled. They also found people living closer to macaque habitats. To work out whether land-use changes have also driven P. cynomolgi transmission to humans, researchers would have to determine if people with the infection had traveled to forests where the parasite is found in macaques, says Fornace.\nAlthough P. cynomolgi infections might not yet pose a major health concern, researchers say, any new infections make it harder for public-health officials and governments to eliminate malaria in these regions. The hosts of P. cynomolgi, long-tailed and pig-tailed macaques (Macaca fascicularis and Macaca nemestrina, respectively), live across southeast Asia. This complicates efforts to eradicate malaria, say researchers, because there is a vast reservoir of the parasite within the monkey population. \"We have been fighting malaria with drugs and bed nets, but we cannot apply these measures on wild macaques,\" says Culleton.\nIf people are constantly at risk of exposure to monkey malaria parasites at the fringes of forests, those areas cannot be considered malaria free, he says. \"That becomes a real problem. And I'm not sure what the solution is.\"\n\nQuestion: How can land clearing make it easier for some simian infections to jump between macaques and humans?

{"text": "The doctrines of Rule of Law, Separation of Powers, and Judiciary Independence are all violated by transferring the full corporation jurisdiction of the High Court to the tribunal.\nParts 1B and 1C of the Companies Act are flawed and illegal because they violate constitutional principles of rule of law, separation of powers, and judicial independence.\nThe legitimacy of NCLT and NCLAT in exercising the powers and jurisdiction of the High Court was affirmed by the court, subject to required adjustments to the Companies Act, 1956, as modified in 2002. The court accepted and maintained Parliament's constitutional competence to create tribunals for dispute resolution. Articles 245, 246 and 247 of the Constitution, along with other entries in the Union List and the Concurrent List, establish Parliament's legislative authority to create courts and tribunals, which is unaffected or controlled by Articles 323A and 323B of the Constitution.\nThe court went on to say that establishing tribunals and transferring judicial powers does not infringe on the rule of law, separation of powers, or the judiciary's independence because the Constitution allows both courts and tribunals to exercise judicial powers. What counts most is whether the tribunals in place respect and uphold the concepts of separation of powers, rule of law, and judicial independence. The constitutions of the NCLT and NCLAT must be subject to judicial review so that the court can investigate the situation to see if these principles are being jeopardized by such tribalization and intervene to protect them.\nAdvantages of Administrative Tribunals\nFlexibility: The introduction of administrative tribunals gave India's judicial system more flexibility and versatility. Unlike the strict and inflexible procedures of a regular court, administrative tribunals follow a more relaxed and casual method.\nSpeedy Justice: The administrative tribunal's main goal is to provide prompt and high-quality justice. Because the technique is not overly complicated, it is simple to make decisions quickly and efficiently.\nLess Expensive: In comparison to ordinary courts, Administrative Tribunals take less time to resolve matters. As a result, the costs are lower. Ordinary courts, on the other hand, are cumbersome and slow-moving, making litigation expensive. As a result, administrative tribunals are less expensive than regular courts.\nQuality Justice: In the current situation, administrative tribunals are the most efficient and effective means of delivering adequate and high-quality justice quickly.\nRelief to the Courts: The administrative adjudication system has lessened the burden of cases on conventional courts.\nDisadvantages of Administrative Tribunals\nThey may be in violation of the Rule of Law's spirit. The Rule of Law assures that arbitrary power does not exist. It is not a power that institutions or individuals wield. It is based on the idea that everyone is subject to and accountable to laws that benefit them. Ordinary courts do not have a uniform code of procedure, and they do not have one either. The majority of judges do not have the same level of independence as the judges and court officers. Individuals with little expertise or training in judicial proceedings, such as administrators and technical heads, are in charge of administrative tribunals.\n\nQuestion: According to the text, what is the most important factor in determining whether tribunals infringe on the rule of law, separation of powers, or the judiciary's independence?

Therefore (1(p)+α2(1−p))/(1(p)+α(1−p))2 is at most 1, and M(p)≤M1. This shows the result for n=2 if M1=M2.\nNow assume that M2>M1, so that s1/μ21<s2/μ22. Then replace s2 with s′2, which is lower than s2, so that s1/μ21=s′2/μ22. If we define M′(p) as the expression for M(p) with $s_2' substituting for s2, we know that M′(p)≤M(p), since s′2<s2. Then the previous result shows that M′(p)≥M1, thus M(p)≥M1 too.\nTo show the result for larger n, we'll induct on n. For n=1 the result is a tautology, M1≤M1, and we've shown the result for n=2. Assume the result is true for n−1, and then notice that f=p1f1+…pnfn can be re-written as f=p1f1+(1−p1)f′, where f′=(p′2f2+…p′nfn) for p′i=pn/(1−p1).

However, since M1≤M2 and M′≥M2, we know that min(M1,M′)=M1, proving the general result.\nTo show M can get arbitrarily close to M1, simply note that M is continuous in the {pi}, define p1=1−ϵ, pi=ϵ/(n−1) for i>1, and let ϵ tend to 0. ↩︎\n\nQuestion: What is the assumption made for n>2 to prove the result for larger n? Answer: It is assumed that the result is true for n−1.\n\nQuestion: What does interpolating between the values x=1 and x=α mean in this context? Answer: It means finding a value between 1 and α that satisfies a certain condition.\n\nQuestion: What is the condition that (1(p)+α(1−p))² must satisfy for all 0≤p≤1?

{"text": "Influenza-like illness (ILI) can be caused by a range of respiratory viruses. The present study investigates the contribution of influenza and other respiratory viruses, the occurrence of viral co-infections, and the persistence of the viruses after ILI onset in older adults. During the influenza season 2014–2015, 2366 generally healthy community-dwelling older adults (≥60 years) were enrolled in the study. Viruses were identified by multiplex ligation–dependent probe-amplification assay in naso- and oropharyngeal swabs taken during acute ILI phase, and 2 and 8 weeks later. The ILI incidence was 10.7%, which did not differ between vaccinated and unvaccinated older adults; influenza virus was the most frequently detected virus (39.4%). Other viruses with significant contribution were: rhinovirus (17.3%), seasonal coronavirus (9.8%), respiratory syncytial virus (6.7%), and human metapneumovirus (6.3%). Co-infections of influenza virus with other viruses were rare. The frequency of ILI cases in older adults in this 2014–2015 season with low vaccine effectiveness was comparable to that of the 2012–2013 season with moderate vaccine efficacy. The low rate of viral co-infections observed, especially for influenza virus, suggests that influenza virus infection reduces the risk of simultaneous infection with other viruses. Viral persistence or viral co-infections did not affect the clinical outcome of ILI.\n... IFNs carry out pleiotropic effects through the induction of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs), which control cellular proliferation, metabolism, Ag presentation, cell recruitment and activation, and inflammation. Across decades of studies, IFNs have irrefutably been deemed essential in the interference against viral infections across tissues, a property that has earned them their name (1). It is now understood that IFNs play a protective role in the pathogenesis of bacterial, fungal, and parasitic infections (26), although in certain contexts, their expression can worsen infectious outcomes (7,8). ...\nIFNs are comprised of three families of cytokines that confer protection against pathogen infection and uncontrolled cellular proliferation. The broad role IFNs play in innate and adaptive immune regulation has placed them under heavy scrutiny to position them as \"friend\" or \"foe\" across pathologies. Genetic lesions in genes involving IFN synthesis and signaling underscore the disparate outcomes of aberrant IFN signaling. Abrogation of the response leads to susceptibility to microbial infections whereas unabated IFN induction underlies a variety of inflammatory diseases and tumor immune evasion. Type I and III IFNs have overlapping roles in antiviral protection, yet the mechanisms by which they are induced and promote the expression of IFN-stimulated genes and inflammation can distinguish their biological functions. In this review, we examine the molecular factors that shape the shared and distinct roles of type I and III IFNs in immunity.\n\nQuestion: Were there any significant differences in ILI incidence between vaccinated and unvaccinated older adults?

{"text": "But our success isn't all about the most \"prestigious\" schools or outcomes. I was over the moon to see this year that many students—including our Foundations students—earned places in schools that their families love and where they can continue to receive support and understanding in English. For many, these are schools of their dreams, and coupled with a KA education provide a springboard to the future. If you'll allow me a brief aside, I'd like to share a recent, related story. Back in 2015, we had a student who was in an intermediate class and who was accepted to a relatively new program at a school called \"Hiroo Gakuen\". That same student, having developed the skills he had built as a Juken student at Hiroo, and knowing what KA could offer rejoined us for the SAT program, and I'm delighted to say he has very recently been accepted to UCLA. His story is just one of many I could share involving our juken students going on to do incredible things, and knowing this is also why the wonderful outcomes we saw for our students mean so much. The commitment everyone made to helping these students grow and to working with them on the challenges they faced, and—fundamentally and crucially, —believing in them was incredible to observe, and I was both ecstatic and grateful to see the word \"pass\" next to so many of those students' names, as well as all of those headed to the most competitive schools.\nIn short: we're immensely proud of everyone's achievements last year. Our teachers, staff, students, and their families all deserve a huge (still socially distanced) pat on the back. It was truly a team effort, and one that went well.\nBut one of the joys of Juken is that the process is never quite \"done\", and success—for both teachers and the next group of students—requires constant reflection, growth, and improvement. I hope that everyone involved in Juken has enjoyed learning about test techniques, refining their knowledge of grammar, and honing their skills as writing teachers, and that you continue to do so. This year, we're looking to boost our program even further. We have the newly formed Juken Management Team who will be making sure that everything runs more smoothly and that there is more support for everyone. Our essays will be graded consistently by essay mentors. A whole new group of teachers have begun the process of obtaining their Juken license. We're offering Power Up! courses to help students build a better understanding of the newly-popular analytical-style essays. And we're redesigning elements of our High School Juken program to make it even stronger than before. This all comes with the support of numerous others in various departments, and all of KA's teachers and staff.\nSo while being a Juken teacher means taking on a lot of responsibility, it also brings a lot of rewards—rewards that stretch far beyond exam success that I hope you've enjoyed. And I'm very much looking forward to working with everyone this year to help continue to build that success across KA.\n\nQuestion: What is one of the main goals for the Juken program this year? Answer: To boost the program even further\n\nQuestion: What was the name of the school that the student was accepted to in 2015?

Our website is a work in progress, but you can register now!\nThe Festival of Radical Awakening\nThe festival of radical awakening is an amazing intersection of social justice, contemporary issues and spirituality. To be spiritual is to see that we are all intimately connected to the earth and each other, happyness and wellbeing are not just personal matters, they are communal ones. For too long wellness and Buddhist spaces have ignored the pressing realities of diversity and justice. Inner wellbeing and awakening has to be matched by an active commitment to justice, the alleviation of poverty, caring for the planet, questioning our privelege, how we can create a beloved community and uplift each other.\nI'm slightly confused by something said in the video. Donald Trump is a rapist and child abuser? He hasn't been convicted in any court of such crimes. Is it then fair to label him as an abuser and a rapist? Just because we do not like someone doesn't mean we can then slander them. I also question the idea that progressives are on the losing side. On the whole it is us conservatives and classical liberals who have lost. Progressives dominate in academia, the media, the workplace and, in the UK at least, in politics. The UK Conservative Party is barely conservative or classically liberal anymore and increasingly adopts progressive ideas. If an employee voices support for progressive values he could be in for a promotion. If another employee expounds voices support for conservative values they could find themselves without a job both in the civil service and in the private sector. None of that has changed under the Tories.\nI'm also confused if Ven. Sujato is saying that progressives are morally superior? If so I would say that no political position has a monopoly on compassion. I am not morally inferior to a progressive just because I am a member of the Conservative Party. A buddhist progressive and a buddhist conservative can both be equally filled with compassion, kindness etc but can differ vastly in their politics as they have different ideas about how to best act on these intentions and what the best policy is. I think it is best to avoid \"I am better, superior or equal\" to others.\n\nQuestion: Is it fair to label Donald Trump as a rapist and child abuser without a court conviction?

How helpful was this? What were your misjudgments (e.g. jumping to conclusions?) How do you see the event now? Consider more balanced responses.\nPerhaps you feel anger toward your abuser; to get in touch with these feelings try imagining yourself as a child. Consider what was done to you and the consequences to your life – the struggle, the losses and the unhappiness. What are your feelings? List ways now of dealing with your anger (e.g. pounding pillows with fists or playing forceful sports then calm yourself by taking a bath). Keep the list close at hand.\nYou may indirectly express your anger by writing a letter to the person; make an assertive telephone call; or you may directly express your anger and confront the person. Try to engage in calming activity afterwards.\nIt is your decision whether you speak out or not, how much you disclose and to whom. Consider the pros and cons of speaking out.\nPlan how you are going to disclose your abuse, to whom, at what time and place and in particular, what you will say. What could go wrong and how could you handle this? Think about the worst-case scenario and have a back-up plan. Familiarize yourself with your task by rehearsing in your imagination.\nIt is your choice whether you confront or not. Think about the pros and cons of confronting and decide whether it is in your best interests. Write down your hopes and distinguish between realistic, unpredictable (beyond your restraint), and unrealistic hopes. Do not rush into confronting. If most of your hopes are unpredictable or unrealistic, it is better to wait until the time is right.\n\nQuestion: What should be considered when deciding whether to speak out about the abuse? Answer: Pros and cons, potential consequences, and planning the disclosure.", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "781c0e84-2bd2-41ca-bf2c-988b78b33749", "url": "http://www.forwardcounselling.com/docs/GD_Program_10_OVERCOMING_CHILDHOOD_ABUSE.docx.html"}
{"text": "Mythbusters: Insurance Edition!\nToday, we're gonna bust some insurance myths! I used to watch a show about 10 years ago called Mythbusters. On the show, these two guys would take these different things that were \"supposedly\" truthful and determine whether they actually could happen or not. Some of these things happened in movies, and they would just take it and test it to see, is this true? Or was it just a myth?\nWell, we're going to do that about insurance. And the thing that you need to be aware of is that there are a lot of myths out there about your insurance coverage. And suppose you believe a myth about your insurance coverage. In that case, you can be making some really bad decisions about your insurance coverage and then get yourself in a position where you've got no insurance coverage at all.\nAlright, so let's break it down. Let's talk about these different myths that a lot of people believe are true about insurance policies, and they may just not be. I'm going to help you to understand what's factual or plausible. And what is nothing more than just a myth.\nMyth #1: Every Homeowner's Policy Covers Flood\nThey DO NOT. almost 100% of all homeowners, insurance policies do not cover floods, they are actually excluded. As a matter of fact, the federal government instituted a program called the National Flood Insurance Program. It's a division of FEMA, you know, the federal emergency department of the government, you know, that division of the government put into place a flood program to provide insurance in the event that your house is actually damaged by flood. Why? Because the damages were just so large from these events, an insurance company just may not be able to sustain under. So the government had to step in to take care of that as an alternative so that people would not lose their homes and become bankrupt and then have to have to leave their homes to be damaged by the flood.\nMyth #2: I Never Had An Accident Or Never Have Caused An Accident, So I Do Not Need Auto Insurance\n\nQuestion: What is the purpose of the Mythbusters: Insurance Edition? Answer: To bust myths about insurance coverage and help people understand what's factual or plausible.\n\nQuestion: Does every homeowner's insurance policy cover floods? Answer: No, almost 100% of homeowners' insurance policies do not cover floods.", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "3c976a7a-a7ac-4a3e-a2d9-ffd4066f5324", "url": "https://www.reedinsla.com/mythbusters-insurance-edition/"}
{"text": "In-depth interviews in Goa, India, show that the parents there aren't attuned to early social and communication milestones, and they usually become alarmed only when a child starts preschool and has trouble connecting with peers4. \"What really concerns the parents initially is, 'he's not fitting in with everybody else',\" says Gauri Divan, a paediatrician working with the child health organization Sangath in Goa.\nPicky eating might point to autism, but a parent noticing a child's eating habits is cultural.\nCredit: FUSE/GETTY IMAGES\nIn some cultures, parents may notice symptoms that are not typically associated with autism. Among Latino migrant workers in Florida, for example, \"the first complaint seems to be that the child is a picky eater,\" says Roy Richard Grinker, a George Washington University anthropologist in Washington DC, who is collaborating with Wetherby on a study of autism in this community. \"But then, if you go into more detail, you start to see that these children the mothers are describing are probably going to fall on the autism spectrum.\" Grinker speculates that these mothers are particularly aware of eating habits because they are poor and food is scarce.\nSome evidence suggests that doctors need to be trained to spot the signs of autism from oblique comments made by parents. For example, Mandell says, white parents in the United States often emphasize a child's lack of communication by saying, 'my child doesn't respond when I call his name', while black parents tend to use phrases like 'my child won't mind me'. Doctors may be less apt to consider a diagnosis of autism when they think a parent is describing a disobedient child rather than a socially impaired one — possibly helping to explain why autism is diagnosed less frequently among black children.\nRaising rates\nIf parents in different cultures developed the same sense of autism awareness as in the West, research suggests, autism prevalence around the world might look no different to — or may be even higher than — in the United States or the United Kingdom.\nPerhaps the most dramatic demonstration of this is a study of more than 55,000 children in South Korea, which estimated autism prevalence at 2.64% (ref. 5). That's more than twice the autism prevalence in the United States estimated by the US Centers of Disease Control and Prevention, and more than 50 times higher than the South Korean government's figure for autism prevalence of 0.046% (ref. 6). One reason for that higher estimate may be that the researchers screened children in the general population for autism symptoms, rather than recruiting them only from clinics for autism and other developmental disorders.\nIn South Korea, researchers suggest that one reason for the underdiagnosis in autism may be that the stigma attached to the disorder is particularly strong in that country7. The diagnosis of a Korean child with autism diminishes the marriage prospects of siblings, and it can even affect his or her parents' careers. Parents often prefer that their child be labelled as having 'reactive attachment disorder', or 'lack of love' as it's known in Korean, a diagnosis that affects the mother's reputation.\n\nQuestion: Who is the pediatrician mentioned in the text who works with Sangath in Goa?

{"text": "No Mow Yards\nWhat's the appeal of a landscape that requires little-to-no mowing during the growing season?\nReducing turf grass lawns can help to diminish the use of fossil fuels in the form of fertilizer and gasoline, as well as the amount of water required to keep grass lush and verdant during summer dry spells.\nThe time you spend mowing could instead be spent gardening flowers, vegetables, and herbs, or enjoying a low-maintenance ground cover from the shade of your porch.\nShort grass also has low stormwater retention rates, leading to stormwater run-off where other plants would more effectively capture the stormwater (and nutrients on site) to hydrate and feed your landscape.\nIf you want to be free from the weekly tedium of running a mower around in circles, here are some low or no-mow alternative plant options, featuring plants available at Fox Hill Gardens. Edging and borders are recommended to maintain clean lines and to prevent the spread of plants outside of the intended bed.\nGround Covers\nGround covers are low-growing, spreading herbaceous or woody plants that provide texture, color, sometimes flower and fruit, and general surface area coverage in lieu of turf grass. Depending on whether your site is sunny, partially shaded, or in deep shade, you can clump a variety of ground covers together with similar light and soil needs; or select your favorite and let it fill in.\nLow-Mow Grasses and Grass-Like Plants\nOrnamental grasses can grow anywhere from one to several feet tall; periodic maintenance with a hedge trimmer, weed whacker, or lawn mower set on high may be desired to maintain a specific height. Some grasses benefit from an aggressive trimming every one to three years for robust re-growth.\nTaller Alternatives\nWe sell dozens of colorful herbaceous perennials for sun and shade that are appropriate for Pennsylvania's climate. Our selection of shade plants in particular will light up and fill in bare batches of ground where turf grass may struggle to thrive.\nMost ferns are adapted for shaded understory locations with well-drained, humusy soil.

Either I must be happy now, must come upon it now or I will never come upon it. Time does mot help me. So I must ask myself why am I not happy ? After all, I have a whole lot of things and pleasures – especially the pleasures which one can't buy – which all of us human beings, rich or poor, have. I am talking of pleasures of friendship, of affection, of the beauty of nature, of the smiles of children, of good health, of just being able to go for a walk. None of these require money, and we all have access to them. Why have I become dissatisfied with what I have ? Is it because I am bored with what I have ? Then I must find out what is boredom. Why am I bored with what I have ? So I look around in my own life, and I watch others. I see that when I first learned to bicycle, there was a great thrill, a great joy in it. But after six months, the bicycle was lying there, and when my mother sent me for an errand, I said, \"Uh, I don't feel like it.\" The thrill was gone, I was bored. So I was seeking something more, something new. I was bored with what I already had. I notice that a young man chases a woman, seeks her, solicits her, falls in love with her, cares for her, is tender and affectionate, and all that. Then he marries her, and after that boredom sets in.

It seems a great tragedy in life that every new experience thrills us, but after a while we become insensitive to it. If you build a house on the seaside, you are thrilled by the beauty of the sea. But after you have lived there for a month, you don't want to look at the sea anymore, you want to go to the town. And the people in the town want to go to the seaside all the time.

{"text": "Know about your healthcare to avoid a medication error, and make certain you know how to take your medications properly. Prevent a dangerous drug interaction or major health problem by knowing how to use your medications.…\nOverconfidence is a dangerous characteristic to have during recovery, as it easily contributes to relapse. The emotions that come with this boisterous behavior can block other issues, making it difficult to treat their addictions. As this behavior continues, the likelihood of relapse grows stronger, which puts users at risk for relapse due to their own missteps.\nWhy Overconfidence Causes Relapse\nHaving an overconfident mindset will hinder any recovering user, as it will only work against him. Overconfidence can lead recovering addicts down a path where the end result is picking up right where they left off in addiction. Overconfidence encourages addiction relapse in any of the following ways:\nA distorted self-image – A major part of recovery is regaining self-esteem and building a healthy level of confidence without going overboard. This allows users to see worth in themselves while they stay humbled by their experiences. Becoming overconfident can be just as detrimental as not starting treatment to begin with, as it makes users feel they can withstand the risk of continuing an addiction.\nIrrational thoughts – Many users think they deserve certain rewards in conjunction with their success. This can include feeling like they deserve a swig of alcohol or any other form of use in the celebration of their sobriety. Irrationally, they can easily convince themselves that one drink or use isn't going to hurt them, as they are now in control of their addictions. This encourages users to engage in risky practices because they think they can handle tempting situations, which often results in relapse.\nComplacency – For users who have remained sober for a long period of time, they may believe their addictions were not as bad as they thought. They may feel that they have come so far in recovery that they can now control their use and still live normally. This mindset encourages people to use once more and ultimately end in a new addiction.\nOverconfidence is a weakness in any area of life, as pride will always come before the fall. While developing a strong sense of confidence and a healthy amount of self-esteem, it is crucial for users to understand that addiction never goes away. Regardless of how long sobriety has lasted or how well recovering addicts have done, addiction can always creep up again. Maintaining sobriety is a life-long process that does not have any room for overconfidence.…\nAlcoholics in recovery often face tempting situations and are at a high risk of relapsing even after long-term sobriety. Negative emotions and unpleasant situations can seem unbearable, and alcohol often seems like the only way to escape. However, there are many dangerous risks that can arise when relapsing on alcohol. Relapsing on alcohol can negatively affect the addict and others in the following ways:\nThe addict's tolerance level for alcohol consumption may be lower due to recovery, which can pose a serious health risk when relapsing and consuming the same amount as before recovery.\nThe addict may lose his or her sense of pride in the achievements that have been made during recovery.\n\nQuestion: What is one way overconfidence can lead to relapse in recovering addicts? Answer: A distorted self-image - believing they can withstand the risk of continuing an addiction.\n\nQuestion: What can relapsing on alcohol cause the addict to lose? Answer: Their sense of pride in the achievements made during recovery.\n\nQuestion: What emotion can overconfidence block, making it difficult to treat addictions?

{"text": "Can I Put All My Debt on a Zero Interest Credit Card?\nThe other day a friend of mine was inquiring about paying off credit card debt using a zero interest credit card.\nShe had moved all of her debt from a high interest credit card to a zero interest credit card and had completely paid off that debt very quickly, which was awesome. She had two other high interest cards and asked me if she should move the debt from those over to the same zero interest card or if she should open a new zero interest credit card. I had to pause a bit before I considered the answer.\nFirst things first.\nA zero interest credit card is a credit card that has zero interest for a certain amount of time, after which the interest rate spikes up, usually higher than a 'regular' credit card. If you're really diligent about paying off a zero interest credit card quickly, you can pay it off before the high interest rate kicks in.\nZero interest credit cards have their pros and cons, and both are pretty simple. In a nutshell:\nPro: You can pay off debt quicker when you have no interest gathering on the debt while it's on a zero percent interest credit card.\nCon: If you don't pay off your debt fast enough on aforementioned card, you'll have a hell of a LOT of interest gathering on that debt.\nSo, let's back to my friend's question about whether or not she should move multiple balances to the same zero interest card. Here are the facts:\nMy friend had 3 high interest cards she needed to pay off\nShe had one zero interest credit card\nShe had already moved two high interest cards onto the zero interest card and had paid off one card's debt already.\nIn May, the zero interest would turn to VERY HIGH interest, probably around 20+ percent, which is awful.\nShe still hadn't moved the third debt and was wondering if she should move it to the zero percent card or open up a new zero percent card for that last debt.\nHere's my answer, with additional questions, in 3 parts:\nCan you beat the balance transfer fee?Some zero percent interest cards have a 3 percent balance transfer fee. If your zero interest card has this fee, you have to calculate whether that 3% is less or more than the interest you will end up paying on the original card before your debt is paid off. For example, if you have $1000 in debt on a card and move it to a zero percent interest card with a 3% balance transfer fee, you'd have to pay $30 to transfer the debt. If you would end up paying less than $30 in interest on the original card before you paid off the $1000, it wouldn't be worth it. If you had a zero percent interest card with no transfer fee (they do exist), you're fine and wouldn't have to make this calculation. If\n\nQuestion: What is the balance transfer fee on some zero percent interest cards?

{"text": "\"I am a single carer with a 19-year-old daughter living at home with me. As a foster carer, I am a baby carer; this means I look after babies from birth, going up to three-year-olds. I don't have a spare room, so babies sleep in my room, where I have two cot beds, so I can take care of twins or siblings when it's required.\n\"Before becoming a foster carer, I worked as a nanny for 28 years; I decided to go into fostering as nannying had lost its sparkle for me. I felt fostering would be so much more rewarding (and I love a challenge) and that is exactly what I have found. All through the good times and the bad, it's extremely rewarding.\n\"My supervising social worker is great, and I feel we have a good working relationship; she is very supportive. I belong to a 'Mockingbird hub' (which I have only just joined) I have been very impressed with it so far.\n\"The hub carers I am working with are really supportive; we get a weekly call, monthly coffee mornings, and one Sunday a month we all get together with our placement children and do an activity. I don't have a placement at the moment because my baby moved to his 'forever family' (adopted) last week.\n\"I have been fostering for nearly four years now and have moved two sets of twins and a baby into adoption, and the transitions were amazing...heart-breaking for me but wonderful for the new parents and babies. The adoption team do an amazing job of planning the children's move and it works so well.\n\"Royal Greenwich has support groups to meet every foster carer's needs and I found the training very informative. We have the Fostering Task Group and I love doing this as you get to help other carers out with children of different ages and it's just a nice change when you are a baby carer. I absolutely love the highs and lows of fostering and the support you get from fellow foster carers and anyone in the fostering team is exceptional.\"\nA mixed heritage married couple.\n\"My name is Maria, I am married Robert and together we are full-time foster carers. Robert and I are one of four Mockingbird hub carers in Greenwich. We started fostering for an independent fostering agency (IFA) in 2012, before we transferred to Royal Greenwich in 2018.\n\"We chose Greenwich instead of other boroughs closer to us because we looked after one of their young people and the fostering team we worked with gave us good wrap-around support that made sure the young person's needs were met. Also, the support we got from Greenwich gave us the tools needed to keep the young person safe in our care. So, when it was time for us to move-on, we decided on Greenwich.\n\nQuestion: How many sets of twins has the speaker in the first part of the text moved into adoption?

{"text": "There's no comparison between 8 GB and 16 GB of RAM for gaming. The main difference between the two is the overall amount of RAM. While 16GB is sufficient for most games, the extra ram isn't necessary for some titles. Games that require more memory run smoother and will experience fewer stutters. However, it's still best to get at least 16GB if possible.\nWhile the cost difference between the two is relatively small, a higher RAM number will allow you to enjoy more games.\nMost games designed for the newer generation require a minimum of 16GB of RAM.\n8GB RAM will suffice for many older games, including pixel art, 2D fighting, and platformers.\nHowever, this is not enough to support the latest games. Most gamers should aim for 16GB of RAM for gaming and heavy multitasking.\nAlthough the size of the RAM on a PC doesn't matter in terms of gaming, the difference in graphics performance is significant. While 8GB of RAM is sufficient for older and simpler games, 16GB RAM will be necessary for games with demanding graphics. While it's possible to play older games with eight GB RAM, experts recommend a minimum of 16 GB RAM to ensure smooth gaming. Ultimately, you'll be better off choosing the RAM your machine can handle.\nWhat Does RAM Do For Gaming\nMemory, or RAM, is a component of your computer that stores content and programs while processing them. Games are stored on the hard drive, but PCs often move data to the RAM for quick access. This makes the process of loading and saving files much faster than if all of the game data were stored in the hard drive. Having enough RAM is important for gamers, as having too little can slow the entire gaming experience.\nHowever, RAM isn't the only factor determining your FPS. Both the CPU and GPU are involved in processing data, so a larger amount of RAM will only increase the FPS of your games. If you're running out of RAM, your system may start to use its storage instead of RAM, which will reduce your FPS. RAM can also increase the overall speed of your PC. RAM upgrades can greatly improve the gaming experience, especially if you're a heavy gamer.\nHow Does RAM Affect Gaming\nHow Does RAM affect gaming performance? This is a common question that divides gamers. RAM is the part of a computer that stores data. The higher the amount of RAM, the more memory is available to run the games. It also helps to run more applications at once and store more temporary data. Memory is measured in megatransfers per second (MT/s) or megahertz, and the higher the speed, the better. The more RAM you have, the faster your computer will respond to read requests.\nWhen you have less RAM, your computer will run slower. It will also take longer to load games. In this case, you should upgrade your RAM.\nRAM is sold in packs of two. Buying two identical RAM sticks will activate the Dual Channel mode, which will speed up your computer.\n\nQuestion: Is 8GB RAM sufficient for newer games? Answer: No\n\nQuestion: What is the benefit of activating the Dual Channel mode by buying two identical RAM sticks? Answer: It will speed up your computer\n\nQuestion: What happens when you have less RAM and try to load a game?

He writes:\nHi everyone, I came through the surgery great. I feel much better already. We're back at the hotel and back home tomorrow. Hugs and kisses and a grandiose thanks for everyone's prayers. Oh, where's the 🍕 pizza. I'm starving. Lol\nDaily Reflection\nOn March 17, the world celebrates the feast day of St. Patrick, a zealous British bishop of the fifth century who became famous for spreading Christianity in Ireland. Patrick is Ireland's main patron saint.\nBut as a medieval historian, I suggest that we also pause to remember another of Ireland's patron saints, the nurturing, compassionate St. Brigid.\n\" Brigid is the bridge, crossing the threshold from Goddess to Saint, Celtic to Christian, North and South, winter and spring, water and fire, masculine and feminine, ancient and modern.\"\nThis year, following a three-year campaign by a feminist organization, herstory.ie, the Irish government finally acknowledged Brigid's importance by declaring a new national holiday on her feast day of Feb. 1. Until now, Ireland counted her among their official three patrons, along with St. Patrick and St. Columcille, or Columba, but gave workers a day off only on St. Patrick's Day.\nThe discovery that sparked a movement\nIn contrast to the handful of women we learn about in Irish schools, Herstory discovered that there are over one thousand fascinating women featured in the Dictionary of Irish Biography. The amnesia of women's stories is not just an Irish problem - this is a global phenomenon.\nWomen's achievements and struggles have been lost in the shadows for too long, resulting in global inequality and a regression of women's rights. That's why Herstory is harnessing the alchemical power of light, to celebrate women and equality, spotlight inequality, and create visions for a World of Equals.\"\n— - Melanie Lynch, Founder of Herstory\nSo who is St. Brigid? Brigid was born in Ireland, sometime around A.D. 450, the child of a slave and a king in the province of Leinster.\nUnfortunately, Brigid left no historical record of her missionary work. All information about Brigid comes from biographies of saints written long after she lived. A churchman named Cogitosus was the first to write about Brigid, in about A.D. 650, or approximately 200 years after her birth.\n\nQuestion: What is the name of the person who sent a message about recovering from surgery? Answer: Steve Lyman\n\nQuestion: Who is the medieval historian mentioned in the text? Answer: The medieval historian is not named in the text.\n\nQuestion: What is the name of the feminist organization that campaigned for a national holiday in St. Brigid's honor?

{"text": "Briefing Room: Caution, Political Correctness Causes Death\nIn the days following the murders at Fort Hood, I heard on the news that an unnamed person working for the FBI stated, and I'm paraphrasing here, that the FBI would be crucified for going after the murderer without more information because he was a Muslim. In short, they did not want to be accused of profiling. Oh my! How politically correct!\nOne \"expert psychiatrist\" on the news (and I use the term \"news\" loosely as well) stated that the murderer was probably \"emotionally disturbed.\" D'oh! Ya think? People who are not emotionally disturbed don't slaughter innocent people.\nLet's be clear here: I frankly don't give a damn if he was a bedwetter, his Daddy missed a few of his Little League games or his Mommy cuddled him on her lap until he was in his teens and made him listen to show tunes. He is simply murdering, terrorist scum—and people who would make excuses for him out of political correctness are not a helluva lot better.\nIf you get the feeling that I'm angry with the above, you'd be wrong—I'm flat-out pissed!\nLiberals and the lamestream media have brainwashed a large percentage of the American people into thinking that profiling is a bad thing. The truth of the matter is that nothing could be further from the truth.\nThe reality is that profiling is not bad; in fact it's part of our instinctive, genetic makeup. Consider the following scenario:\nYou are standing in the lobby of a large building waiting for an elevator. Two elevators open simultaneously. In one are six young, angry-looking dudes wearing clothes with the same colors. In the other are senior citizens wearing AARP name badges. You decide to get in the elevator with the senior citizens.\nGuess what? You callous, mean-spirited person, you! You have just profiled those poor underprivileged young men as gang members—and it may have saved your wallet, if not your life.\nOr:\nYou're a cop on the beat at 0200 and a car pulls out of a bar. Chances are good that the driver is not acting as a decoy for the real drunks still in the bar, so you stop him to make sure he's not impaired to the point where he may take innocent lives. Profiling on a smaller scale, perhaps, but profiling nonetheless—as well as good police work.\nPolitical correctness needs to go out on the trash heap right along with the flat Earth theory and the global warming scam.\nLet's pray that the next time a homegrown terrorist or Islamo-Fascist is discovered, whether through profiling or not, someone has the guts to speak out and their bosses have the cojones to pass the information along before another massacre occurs.\n\nQuestion: What was the author's opinion on the psychiatrist's statement about the murderer? Answer: The author thought the psychiatrist's statement that the murderer was \"emotionally disturbed\" was obvious and not a valid excuse for his actions.\n\nQuestion: According to the author, what is an example of good profiling in a police context? Answer: The author used the example of a police officer stopping a car that pulls out of a bar at 0200 to check for drunk driving, as this is an example of good profiling and police work.", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "9dfee222-479b-4e3d-ad02-2735455cf4d8", "url": "https://www.swatmag.com/article/briefing-room-caution-political-correctness-causes-death/"}

The mine produced approximately 30 thousand tons annually during British Rule which increased to 188,000 tons annually.\nDuring the years 1946 and 1947, the mine produced 190,000 tons while in 1950 it produced 137,000 tons per annum. In 2003, the mine reported producing 385,000 tons of salt per year which were considered half production of Pakistan's rock salt. At such an excavation rate, the mine is expected to be a source of salt for more than 350 years.\nKhewra Salt Mine Structure\nThe structure comprises 19 stories among which 11 stories are underground. The mine is excavated about 750 meters in the mountain and comprises a tunnel of forty kilometres. Excavation is done through the method of pillar and room. The average temperature inside the mine is 18 – 20 degrees centigrade and the temperature remains the same throughout the year.\nUsage of Khewra Salt\nThe salt of Khewra is known as one of the best salt founded in Pakistan which is mostly used in cooking all over Pakistan. Moreover, it is used for bath salt of utensils and used as brine. It is also used in many industries for making ornamental things like statues, ashtrays, lamps and vases which are exported all over the world including the US, Europe and India.\nThe manufacturing of decorative items from Khewra salt was started in the times of the Mughals when they used to make tableware and many other decorative items from salt. Warth introduced rock salt similar to gypsum in characteristics and used it for cutting art pieces.\nClinical Facilities\nIn 2007, a clinical ward was established for the treatment of respiratory diseases including Asthma through Salt Therapy with a total cost of ten million rupees.\nTourist Sites\nThere are many tourist attractions here and about 25 hundred thousand visitors come every year.

The repo market underpins much of the U.S. financial system, helping to ensure banks have the liquidity to meet their daily operational needs and maintain sufficient reserves.\nWhat happened in the repo market?\nThe repo market is where dealers in low-risk liquid assets are able to obtain short-term cash through selling their securities to counterparty buyers through a repurchasing agreement before being required to purchase the securities back at a pre-agreed point in time.\nWhat is a repo market?\nThe repo market is the name given the marketplace for collateralised loans.

So, I decided to write a short post to explain some of the basics.\nHere is the photo that I posted:\nSpot Metering Mode\nSpot metering improves the image quality in high contrast lighting\nGenerally speaking, in a contrasty light situation, you can improve the image quality by just using Spot metering to capture the details on a particular part of the scene. For instance, if you take photos of a subject under intense light (such as the sun) and the background is in shadow and dark, you need to use Spot Metering.\nHigh Contrast Light\nSpot Metering on the leaf\nOn the other hand, if the subject is darker than the background, you should use Spot Metering again. Here is an example:\nBack Light Subject\nIn this photo I selected Spot Metering for correct exposure\nLastly, for taking pictures of the sky, sunrise or sunset, Spot Metering maintains the exposure for the sky. Therefore, you capture the rich and saturated colours of the sky.

{"text": "Caring for Your Horse in Hot and Humid Climates with Elite Equine\nAs summer approaches, horse owners and riders must take extra precautions to keep their horses safe from hot, humid conditions. Like humans, horses sweat to keep themselves cool. As the sweat evaporates from the skin, it creates a cooling effect that prevents the animal from overheating. However, when humidity is high, sweat is slower to evaporate. Horses that work in hot, humid conditions can lose as much as two to four gallons of sweat an hour.\nTo keep your horse happy and healthy in hot and humid climates, it's important to understand how relative humidity and air temperature impact horse cooling. Horse owners also need to be on the lookout for signs of overheating. Learn more about caring for your horse in hot, humid environments.\nIf air temperature (Fahrenheit) and relative humidity (percentage) are:\nLess than 130 – Horse cooling efficiency is at its most effective\nBetween 130 and 150 – Horse cooling efficiency is decreased\nGreater than 150 – Horse cooling efficiency is greatly reduced\nGreater than 180 – The horse's condition can be fatal\nSigns of Overheating in Horses\nHorses generate a large amount of heat through digestion and muscular activity. Overheating can occur when horses are not able to maintain adequate cooling mechanisms, resulting in heat exhaustion or possible heatstroke. Several signs could indicate that your horse is experiencing heat stress, such as:\nGood horse care requires owners to take the necessary steps to protect their hoses in hot, humid conditions. These five tips can help keep your horse cool and comfortable.\nProvide Access to Clean Water\nHorses should always have unlimited access to cool, clean water. An adult horse can drink upwards of 10 to 20 gallons of water daily while at rest. More water is needed in hot, humid conditions.\nOffer Adequate Shelter and Shade\nYour horse should have a place where it can go to get out of the hot sun. This could be a natural or man-made shady area that is well ventilated. Consider adding fans to horses in confined spaces to keep them cool.\nAvoid Riding Your Horse in Hot Weather\nExcessive heat can put undue stress on your horse, especially older, overweight, or out-of-shape horses. Avoid riding your horse when the combined temperature and relative humidity are above 150. If you do want to ride, consider riding early in the morning or later in the evening when it's cooler. Keep the ride short and allow for frequent breaks.\nConsider Adding Electrolytes to Water and Immune Support Supplements to Food\nAdding electrolytes to your horse's water after it has been sweating heavily can help keep the body functioning normally. Be sure to also offer plain water as some horses do not like the taste of electrolytes and may choose to drink less. Other supplements can also help your horse maintain good health. Elite Equine offers an organic natural rosehip supplement for horses that support a horse's anti-inflammatory process and immune system which will help aid in recovery from exercise and heat-related stress.\n\nQuestion: What is the temperature and humidity range where horse cooling efficiency is greatly reduced? Answer: Greater than 150.\n\nQuestion: What is the primary way horses cool themselves? Answer: Horses cool themselves by sweating.\n\nQuestion: What is the name of a supplement offered by Elite Equine that supports a horse's immune system?

{"text": "This really is a terrible attempt to justify these practically foolish budget announcements. In writing this many false, household budget = government budget myths and equivalencies are pushed forward. In reality a government budget is quite different from a household budget and this has implications for the economy.\nThe government should be empowered to act in a counter-cyclical manner, and the problem with these announcements is that they are premised on the government being able to do this and to run a budget surplus at the same time. If the country runs a current account deficit (among other causes) over the surplus period then already the goals of acting counter-cyclically and the goal of running a budget surplus are in conflict. At that stage it depends if they prioritize surplus or economic stabilization. It would be reasonable to suggest National has prioritized surplus in these circumstances with many cost cutting measures resulting.\nOne of the more problematic myths (imported here) is that the government is financially constrained and needs to 'save' and repay debt to maintain its spending capacity or it will not be 'loaned funds' by the non-government sector. This is entirely untrue, and government spending happens when it credits bank accounts with funds in accounts maintained by the reserve bank (or debits the same for taxation purposes). Of course the RBNZ is a part of the government, and is even consolidated into the government accounts. This demonstrates the government does not face a budget constraint. The fact that the government regularly borrows is used to drain the excess (to requirements for functional inter-bank payments) reserves back out of the banking system and so to prevent the 90-day bank bills rate falling towards zero (e.g probably cheaper bank interest rates). Another fact coincident with this state of affairs is that money as well as debt sit in the liability side of the government accounts (and money and government debt are both assets of the non-government). The main consequence of reducing such liabilities which the government must consider is that it is draining assets from the non-government, either interest paying assets (government debt) or non-interest paying assets (money).\nAs an opponent of the \"government budgets are like household budgets\" myth, I actually support these rules on the assumption that the Labour Party is being completely honest with them. (I know the GP are being because that's their style anyway)\nThe rules do state that they want surpluses over the cycle. That means the government is empowered to run counter-cyclical deficits, they just expect to make back a net surplus over the length of the entire cycle once the economy is out of recession. (and they will have independent reporting to keep them honest on whether they manage it to incentivise going back into a net cyclical surplus when out of recession)\n\nQuestion: What does it mean for the government to act in a counter-cyclical manner? Answer: It means the government should spend more during economic downturns and less during economic booms to stabilize the economy.\n\nQuestion: What are the consequences for the non-government sector when the government reduces its liabilities? Answer: It drains assets from the non-government sector, either interest-paying assets (government debt) or non-interest-paying assets (money).\n\nQuestion: Can the government run a budget surplus and act counter-cyclically at the same time if the country has a current account deficit?

{"text": "This concludes the selective short history of ventilation. The idea that ventilation promotes health by removing harmful substances has been a lingering and recurring theme. The effects of indoor exposure to harmful substances are typically studied as dose–response assessments. [39] The relevant exposure dose is the concentration of the harmful substance in the indoor air and the responses are the measureable effects on humans. When adverse health effects are established, the exposures of those harmful substances are usually regulated or their use simply forbidden. [39] This also means that, in principle, there should be no known harmful substances to be removed by ventilation in the indoor environment. As will be evident in Section 2.3, most guidelines for ventilation requirements are based on perceived indoor air quality, and not health, criteria.\nNevertheless, there is a case for using ventilation as a precautionary measure to prevent adverse health effects caused by the indoor environment. There has been a significant increase in the number of chemicals never before encountered in the indoor environment, particularly in the last fifty years. [43] Today, literally thousands of chemicals are present in the indoor air (see for example [53]). Since most studies of dose–response assessments focus on one single substance at the time, the effects of mixtures of substances are largely unknown. [54] In addition, a majority of these new indoor chemicals have not been studied for health effects. When a harmful substance is forbidden, it is often substituted for new substances with (as yet) unknown health effects. In light of these known unknowns, it may be prudent to specify some minimum ventilation requirements as a precautionary health measure.\n2.2 Some insights from the theory of ventilation\nBefore critically examining the existing guidelines for ventilation requirements a few theoretical explanations of the salient points are needed. Consider first the One-zone model as shown in\nFigure 3a\n. The flows of air supply to, and air exhaust from, the zone are equal. An air pollutant is emitted at a constant rate into the zone. The assumption for now is that the zone is fully mixed, i.e. the concentration of air pollutant is exactly the same everywhere in the zone. The validity of this assumption, and other assumptions, will be discussed below.\nAssuming that the initial concentration of air pollutant is zero and no air pollutant enters via the air supply (c0=cext=0), the mass balance equation for the air pollutant in the zone is\nFigure 3.\nSimple zone models.

However, indoor air quality is more important to our health than the air we breathe outside. After all, many of us spend most of our time indoors, especially during the winter season. Proper furnace maintenance is critical to maintaining good air quality in your home.\nAccording to the EPA, the air inside your home can be drastically more polluted than the air we breathe outside. Poor indoor air quality can lead to a number of health complications and diseases. Some of the most common side effects are the development of allergies or asthma but over time, poor indoor air quality can also lead to more serious health problems. People have been known to develop respiratory disease or even cancer due to poor air quality. Another more severe and deadly consequence of improper furnace maintenance is carbon monoxide poisoning.\nFurnace repair and maintenance is an important factor to maintaining your overall air quality. If your furnace is not properly maintained and serviced, you run the risk of particulates building up in the furnace. These particulates then have the potential to circulate through your home's HVAC system and negatively affect your indoor air quality. In addition to having your furnace serviced, you can also help eliminate the build of these particulates by regularly changing your furnace filter.\nTake control of your indoor air quality and help protect your family's health!

After every killing and massacre of American Indians, white killers and genociders will celebrate with big feasts and prayers which they called it 'Thanksgiving.' It is a travesty of justice and fake piousness with greatest hypocrisy in invoking the name of God for their evil deeds.\nWhat the white Americans in both USA and Canada tell is not true. The true story is the European invaders and settlers after killing of whole native villages would celebrate and called it 'Thanksgiving.' Abraham Lincoln declared Thanksgiving Day on Thursday, 26th November, 1863 as official National Holiday. He ordered 38 Dakota native Americans to be hang for war crimes which they fabricated. Native all lost their lives to savage white invaders. The white men Thanksgiving is a twisted celebration of their killings of countless innocent native lives and wholesale genocide of many native American tribes.\nDaunnette and her friend two native American Indian girls are thankful for being born indigenous to America. They and other proud natives are being thankful for still having their culture preserve alive by the native elders. Their elders kept their culture alive, strong and stand as one united in the face of European aggression.\nThe first immigrants from England arrived in 1620 aboard the ship Mayflower to the shores of present day Massachusetts, in Plymouth. These British pioneers were only able to survive the harsh first winter on the alien continent due to the selfless assistance of the native American Indians especially those from the Squanto and Wampanoag tribes. With the help of the natives who taught them to cultivate maize, potato and tomato they survived and began to build a new home for their families. With their first successful harvest the pilgrims came together to rejoice in Thanksgiving and praise God for His provision. This was white men's first 'Thanksgiving Day.'\nThe pilgrims first met the Wampanoag nation which comprised of sixty-nine tribes. The wampanoag was part of the one of hundreds of Tribal Nations with diverse societies that had thrived for thousands of years before the arrival of the pilgrims. So America was not new as it had been inhabited by the natives for thousands of years.\n\nQuestion: What was the total number of tribes that made up the Wampanoag nation?

{"text": "Now that we're starting to understand how to identify constituents by looking at a tree, let's look at the grammar that was used to create this parse tree. The grammar below is a very small toy example of a grammar that might be used to describe the structure of a limited number of sentences in English.\nS (Sentence) à NP VP\nNP (Noun phrase) à Det Nom\nNom (Nominal) à N Nom | N\nVP (Verb Phrase) à V NP\nN (Noun) à cat | dog | man | woman | person\nV (Verb) à bit | bites | licks | licked\nDet (Determiner) à the\nIn this notation, the symbol on the left side of the arrow (called a non-terminal symbol) can be formed by the element(s) on the right side of the arrow. For example, a sentence (S) can be formed by the combination of a noun phrase (NP) preceding a verb phrase (VP). The pipe symbol (|) means \"or\", so a nominal (Nom) can either be formed by a noun (N) followed by a nominal, or by a noun alone. Notice that some rules just have a list of words on the right side of the arrow. Words are called terminal symbols because they only occur at the leaves (i.e., nodes that do not have any children) of the parse tree. In most cases, the symbol on the left side a rule with a single word symbol on the right is the same as the part of speech tag for that word.\nUsing this grammar, let's build the parse tree we saw above. There are multiple ways to build a parse tree, but for the sake of simplicity, we'll build this one from the bottom up. First, we look at the words in our sentence \"The dog big the man\" and see what rules we can apply. It looks like all of the words have a corresponding rule that gives a label to that single word. Let's draw those labels:\nYou may notice that we added two labels to the nouns in the sentence – first the noun label, then the nominal label. While an important distinction in linguistics, for our use case, we can assume nouns and nominals are essentially the same category.\nNow that we have labels above each word resulting in a sequence of labels – Det, Nom, V Det, Nom – we can look at our grammar again to see what rules might apply to the sequence of labels. Because we have the sequence \"Det Nom\", we can apply the NP à Det Nom rule. In fact, we can apply this rule twice, since there are two \"Det Nom\" sequences in our sentence:\nWith this rule, we have formed two new noun phrases, and our node label sequence now reads: NP, V, NP. The order of symbols on the right side of a rule matters when applying a grammar. So while there is no rule in our grammar that forms a constituent out of the sequence \"NP V\", there is a rule that forms a constituent out of the sequence \"V NP\": VP à V NP. Therefore we can add a new VP node and connect it to the children nodes V and NP:\n\nQuestion: Which part of speech is the word \"bit\" in the given grammar? Answer: The word \"bit\" is a Verb (V) in the given grammar.", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "e615887b-aa3a-4795-a6c1-4adc2dd351fa", "url": "https://www.businessolver.com/blog/linguistic-insights-for-natural-language-understanding-syntax-and-constituency-parsing/"}
{"text": "What Is the Weight of One Cord of Wood?\nBur oak vs. pin oak\nWhether you're interested in bur oak or pin oak, you will want to know the difference between the two. Both are used for hardwood construction but have their strengths and weaknesses. The differences in weight are significant since you'll have to consider them when you're planning on hauling the wood home.\nBur Oak is a white oak family member, which includes several other similar species. It grows naturally in various habitats, including the Great Plains, Midwest, and Canada. It has a large canopy and is, therefore, a good shade tree. It also has a moderate growth rate. It's best suited for larger lawn spaces. It can grow up to 75 feet tall, with a diameter of 3 feet.\nThe bur oak is known for its rounded lobes, shaped like teeth. The acorns of the bur oak have a fuzzy cap. They are slightly more unusual than their cousins, the pin oak acorns. The acorns of the bur Oak can range in size from the size of limes to a few inches long.\nThe bur oak leaf has a few oddities, such as being wider at the ends than at the base. Its leaves have a coarse grain and light to medium brown color. In the wild, its leaves have five to nine rounded lobes.\nSimilarly, the bur oak end grain has a few other exciting features. It has numerous tiny latewood pores in radial arrangements and some diffuse-in-aggregates, which are short lines between rays. A few rows of large earlywood pores also characterize the bur oak end grain. It's also got some of the best acorns of all North American oaks since the bur oak acorns are notably large. The Bur Oak acorn's other prominent distinguishing feature is the tyloses, which are abundant in the end grain.\nThe half-cord of green apple wood is the smallest of the bunch, and the Bur Oak and the pin oak are the lightest. The red oak, however, weighs about the same as the bur oak.\nThe best way to measure the weight of a piece of wood is to use a weighted estimate. This can be done by dividing the cord's weight by the number of pounds you want to haul. This will give you an approximate idea of how many trips you'll need to make to get the wood home. A half-ton pickup truck is more than enough to get the job done. If you're working with a larger vehicle, you can usually load the entire cord in one trip.\nIt's hard to beat the quality of oak, and it's a good choice for various hardwood applications. It's not only durable, but it's also reasonably priced. It can be used for several structures, such as fences and cabinets. If you're considering using oak for a project, it's essential to check the fire before adding it to the mix.\nPine\n\nQuestion: Which type of oak is heavier, bur oak or pin oak?

{"text": "Next comes lighting. I always recommend shooting in the first hours of daylight or the last few with the sun either to my back or facing me directly. This varies on what effect I'm going for with my images. More often than not, you'll want the sun on your back as it is in the image above. We call this shooting on \"Sun-angle\". Shooting in these hours not only provides the most pleasing light, it also happens to be cooler, which in turn, makes for active wildlife. It's also worth shooting when the sun isn't visible at all. Overcast days provide soft, diffuse light that can be pleasing throughout the day. In fact, I prefer to shoot on these days for most other songbirds I photograph.\nAs this species prefers life on the ground, finding one in the open was quite the challenge. As luck would have it, this patch of grassland habitat harbored a number of singing males. This resulted in territorial skirmishes between neighboring birds. Once a male had successfully chased the intruder off, it would perch atop a grass stalk and sing. The height of the grass allowed me to crouch down and remain almost invisible from the height of the sparrow. As this is not a heavily visited location, the birds were not accustomed to human presence. I had to tread carefully. Once in position, I remained in the area for much of the evening. By sitting as still as possible, I managed to photograph three individual males.\nAs stated above, if there's one time and place you want the longest lens possible, it's here. Songbirds, especially these sparrows, are small and skittish. As stated above, I spent most of the shoot crouching along the fields edge to stay hidden. I also got low as to shoot from my subjects eye-level. Being at the same level as your subject is essential to engaging your audience. It's scenarios like these where super-telephoto zooms are ideal. If the bird comes closer, you can always zoom out without moving and startling the bird. These lenses also tend to be lighter than their prime counterparts, although new mirrorless lenses as well as Nikon's Phased Fresnel optics are narrowing the margin.\nA major aspect I made sure to check before situating myself, was the backgrounds. I made sure to keep an eye out for bright objects in the distance. Any one distracting element can throw the whole composition off, and I try to avoid removing spots in post as much as possible. A wide aperture and the vast field ultimately made for a nice, smooth background. Remember, the farther away the background, the blurrier it will become. As long as you're using a long lens, this occurs regardless of aperture.\n\nQuestion: What did the author do to remain almost invisible to the sparrows? Answer: The author crouched down to the height of the grass and remained as still as possible.\n\nQuestion: What was the challenge in finding the particular sparrow species in the open? Answer: The sparrow prefers life on the ground, making it difficult to find in the open.\n\nQuestion: What is the effect of a wide aperture and a vast field on the background of a photograph?

{"text": "Streszczenie: (1) Background: Free space optics communication (FSO) has improved wireless communication and data transfer thanks to high bandwidth, low power consumption, energy efficiency, a high transfer capacity, and a wide applicability field. The FSO systems also have their limitations, including weather conditions and obstacles in the way of transmission. (2) Methods: This research assesses the atmospheric conditions' influence on the intensity of received radiation, both experimentally and theoretically. The construction of a laboratory test stand of the FSO system, which is operating in the third-atmosphere transmission window (8–12 μm), is proposed. Next, considering different atmospheric conditions, the experimental validation was conducted, both in a laboratory and real conditions. (3) Results: The measurements were carried out for two optical links working with wavelengths of 1.5 μm and 10 μm. It was found that optical radiation with a wavelength of about 10 μm is characterized by better transmission properties in the case of limited visibility (e.g.,light rain and fogs) than in the case of near-infrared waves. The same conclusion was found in analytical investigations. (4) Conclusions: The results obtained show that optical radiation with a wavelength of about 10 μm in limited visibility is characterized by better transmission properties than near-infrared waves. This demonstrates the validity of designing FSO links operating in the range 8–12 μm band, e.g., based on quantum cascade lasers and HgCdTe photodiodes.\nStreszczenie: In the nervous system, information is conveyed by sequence of action potentials, called spikes-trains. As MacKay and McCulloch suggested, spike-trains can be represented as bits sequences coming from Information Sources (IS). Previously, we studied relations between spikes' Information Transmission Rates (ITR) and their correlations, and frequencies. Now, I concentrate on the problem of how spikes fluctuations affect ITR. The IS are typically modeled as stationary stochastic processes, which I consider here as two-state Markov processes. As a spike-trains' fluctuation measure, I assume the standard deviation σ, which measures the average fluctuation of spikes around the average spike frequency. I found that the character of ITR and signal fluctuations relation strongly depends on the parameter s being a sum of transitions probabilities from a no spike state to spike state. The estimate of the Information Transmission Rate was found by expressions depending on the values of signal fluctuations and parameter s. It turned out that for smaller s < 1, the quotient ITR/σ has a maximum and can tend to zero depending on transition probabilities, while for 1 < s, the ITR/σ is separated from 0. Additionally, it was also shown that ITR quotient by variance behaves in a completely different way. Similar behavior was observed when classical Shannon entropy terms in the Markov entropy formula are replaced by their approximation with polynomials. My results suggest that in a noisier environment (1 < s), to get appropriate reliability and efficiency of transmission, IS with higher tendency of transition from the no spike to spike state should be applied. Such selection of appropriate parameters plays an important role in designing learning mechanisms to obtain networks with higher performance.\n\nQuestion: What is the suggested approach to improve transmission reliability and efficiency in a noisier environment (1 < s)? Answer: To apply Information Sources (IS) with a higher tendency of transition from the no spike to spike state.\n\nQuestion: How does the quotient ITR/σ behave for smaller values of s (sum of transitions probabilities from a no spike state to spike state)?

I don't have one blue and one hazel eye (as awesome as that would be); both of my eyes are blue with grey flecks, teal strata, a dark blue ring, and a yellow burst in the middle.\n22. Beyond Tying Cherry Stems\nI can fold my tongue in half laterally, straight across the middle, and hold it there with the strength of my tongue muscle alone. So far, I've not met another person who can do it without holding their tongue there using the roof of their mouth. I'm certain others can do it, I've just not met any.\n23. Let me Read Your Aura\nI'm not sure if I'm considered rare, but I can sometimes see colored lights around people. Kind of like a mood ring, or aura. The colors depend on their mood and can change. When I was younger I saw them all the time, but when I asked my mother what the light meant she became really angry and told me there was no such thing.\n24. I Don't Get High\nI'm immune/highly resistant to opioids. I've been prescribed them numerous times for post-operative pain management but always complained to my doctors about them not working, and leaving me in a considerable amount of pain. I was also given them at high doses before surgeries with little to no results which shook doctors.\nI've never abused opioids previously, plus I was strongly against taking them due to the addictive nature before finding out they're duds to me. You can just imagine how fun surgeries or recoveries are! Good thing I rarely have surgeries in addition to relatively high pain tolerance. Phew!\n25.

{"text": "FLM Step 21: Doctor, educator, & author on discipline & dedication author, educator, and Doctor Taffy Wilkins Wagner talks about documenting your spending.\nDiscipline and dedication are the watch words for Day 21. Discipline because in the beginning if you are not used to keep track of your expenses on paper, you will have to force yourself to do it. For example, if you are a spender more than likely you have either a pocket or purse full of receipts. You are to be commended for keeping the receipts. However, you are probably not aware of what exactly exist in your account at the time you are shopping. You have comfort in knowing there is money in the account which gives you the green light to shop.\nI applaud you for getting to Day 21. This day you are going to turn over a new leaf per se. With your willingness to gain continued financial learning, you are to exercise discipline and write down every expense. I heard someone say \"ouch\". I know you have heard the saying \"No pain, no gain.\" Same holds true in financial literacy and education. In your mind, this will be painful to have to stop and write down all your expenses. Naturally you will be resistant. The idea is to create a new habit of writing it down. It will become a normal regimen probably after seven to ten days.\nResist no more. Your taking the step to write down your expenses every time you spend money is going to serve a bigger purpose than before. Documenting your spending is going to show you in black and white specifically where your money is truly going. Prior to this task, you would not have been able to say exactly where your money went day in and day out. Sure you would have had receipts but more than likely you have automatic withdrawals that are coming out that you are not aware of the day of the month when they come out, in addition to quarterly or annual deductions. Every expense impacts the financial household.\nKnowing the realistic picture in finances also takes dedication. This is not something that should be done haphazardly. It is important to be faithful in recording this information. Do not just say you are going to do it and then the first time you forget, throw your hands up and say that's it. No, pick your pencil or pen and write down the expense as soon as you remember that you did not record it. Give yourself a little bit of leeway because you might not have been documenting your spending before.\nDiscipline and dedication are traits you want to have for overall financial health and literacy\n\nQuestion: What are some examples of expenses that might not be immediately apparent?\nAnswer: Automatic withdrawals, quarterly or annual deductions.\n\nQuestion: What should you do if you forget to record an expense?\nAnswer: Write it down as soon as you remember.\n\nQuestion: How long does it take to form the habit of writing down expenses?\nAnswer: It may take seven to ten days.", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "65bf38a0-2d4d-46af-852d-b47ffa9ea9e9", "url": "https://www.moneymanagement.org/blog/flm-step-21-doctor-educator--author-on-discipline--dedication"}

{"text": "Moral Reasoning\nIn the history of moral psychology, there is perhaps no more central figure than Lawrence Kohlberg. His cognitive developmental theory of moral reasoning dominated the field for decades. Briefly stated, he argued that moral development is best thought of as one's progression in their capacity to reason morally about various moral dilemmas or conflicts of interest (The most widely known moral scenario used in his research is usually referred to as the Heinz dilemma). Kohlberg suggested that children begin by reasoning about such dilemmas ...\nKohlberg developed six stages that a child will go through using a story called \"Heinz steals the drug.\" In the story Heinz's wife is dying of cancer and the towns druggist has something that can help her but is charging more than Heinz can afford so Heinz steals the drug to save his wife's life. Children aged 10, 13, and 16 years old were asked if what Heinz did was okay. In the story children go from stage one, where they start to recognize higher authorities and that there are set rules and punishments for breaking those rules; to stage six, where good principles make a good society. They also start to define which of the principles are most agreeable and fair.\nMoral Willpower\nMetcalfe and Mischel (1999) research the idea of willpower in regards to the delay of gratification paradigm. They propose a hot/cool system in which one can control one's emotions while still being driven by impulses. The hot system is referred to as the \"go\" system whereas the cool system is referred to as the \"know\" system. The different systems being triggered decide how one reacts to different stimuli being presented.\nBaumeister, Miller and Delaney (2005) state that \"[t]he self can free its actions from being determined by particular influences, especially those of which it is aware.\" (p. 68) But there is a substantial cost in resisting these natural reactions and promoting moral ones. Studies have shown that improvement of \"self-regulation\" or willpower for a long period of time can develop by practicing the building of self control through repeated exercise. Previous research has shown that exertions of self-control can be exercised in a short period of time lead to decrements of self-control. Both of these findings confirm the view that self-control is similar to a muscle because in the short run exertion makes self-control tired and diminishes its power, in the long run, exercise makes self-control stronger and increases its power. This finding can be a benefactor for people who have issues as addiction and substance abuse, who, lack any self-control by practicing building up their self-control to adjust their unwanted behaviors, thoughts, and actions through physical and mental exercises.\nMoral Behavior\nA study conducted by Reynolds and Ceranic identified the various contributors to moral behavior,\ntwo of which are the idea of moral judgment and moral identity. Reynolds and Ceranic identified\nsome major limitations in these classic cognitive moral development theories.\nThey sought to bring together the concept of moral identity and moral judgment, rather than\nstudying them as separate contributors to moral behavior. This research suggests that moral\n\nQuestion: Who is the central figure in the history of moral psychology according to the text?

They'll try to impose fixes based on a flawed grasp of the situation and then be confused when it doesn't have the expected effect. Hoover thought he could curb unemployment at the start of the Great Depression by cajoling companies not to fire anyone, not realizing that that was treating symptoms, not the disease. Carter scolded us to drive 55 and was miffed when we ignored him. Bloomberg decided that he could improve New Yorkers' health by making it difficult to buy Big Gulps and didn't understand why people ridiculed him for it. I can only imagine what grand plans Bloomberg has for the nation.\nAs complex as technical problems can be, people are much more complex than that. When progressive engineers are confronted with this fact, usually after repeated failures, they typically come to see people as the problem. I suppose that from where they stand, we are the problem.

{"text": "Lighting technology has come a long way over the last half a century, and one of the most widely used lighting technology today is LED. LED stands for Light Emitting Diode (LED), a lighting technology that has proven to be energy-efficient and long-lasting. Today, LED is used in almost every sphere of human life. Swimming pools are also not left out as we see LED massively deployed as a standard pool lighting system.\nIn this article, we will review LED Pool lights, the different types of pool lights, and how much light your swimming pool requires to be perfectly illuminated. Below, you will get all the major and minor information you require as far as LED pool lights are concerned.\nWhat is LED Pool Light Lumens?\nLumens refer to the quality of brightness displayed by LED bulbs. While incandescent bulbs and other types of lighting systems are measured in watts, LED bulbs are measured in Lumens. Typical LED bulbs used in swimming pools can produce between 1400-1750 lumens. But as for incandescent bulbs, when measured in Lumens, the highest most of them can generate is 500 Lumens. To gain a perfect understanding of the Lumens to Watt ratio, a 100 Watt bulb can produce between 1400-1750 lumens while a much smaller bulb of, let's say, 40 watts will only generate lumens of 450. So when considering LED bulbs for your swimming pool, you may go for a 1400-1750 lumens bulb or even a bulb as high as 5400 lumens.\nTypes of LED Pool lights\nThere are different types of LED pool lights used today in pools of all sizes. Having a luxury of options opens up even more opportunities to choose bulbs that will suit your pool. Let us take a look at some of the common LED pool lights used today.\nAbove Ground Pool lights\nAs the name suggests, an above-ground pool light is installed at a level slightly above the water. These types of lights may have water-resistant features, but they are mainly used as beautification objects just a much as they are used for illumination purposes. Above ground, lights are installed at strategic points and in regular order.\nInground Pool Lights\nInground lights are installed on the swimming pool floors. These lights are water-resistant, and they are designed to beautify pools too. When switched on at night, they illuminate the pool.\nFloating LED Pool Lights\nA floating pool light is not fixed to the pool walls or the ground surface of the pool. Floating lights are wired together and connected to a central power system. Just like the others, floating pool lights floating on the water surface due to their lightweight feature. There are also floating lights that are battery-powered and do not need to be connected to a central power system. These types use rechargeable batteries to generate light.\n\nQuestion: Which of the following is NOT a type of LED pool light mentioned in the text? (Choose one)\nA) Above Ground Pool lights\nB) Inground Pool lights\nC) Underground Pool lights\nD) Floating LED Pool lights\nAnswer: C) Underground Pool lights\n\nQuestion: How many lumens can a typical incandescent bulb produce? Answer: Up to 500 lumens\n\nQuestion: What does LED stand for in the context of lighting technology?

There are particular habits that cheaters have that stand out. If you don't want to be dating a cheater you can look for these nasty habits before you fall in love with the wrong person or know the dirty secrets of someone you are already dating. Let's have a read;\n#1 Phone Tracker & Reverse Lookup\nSee dating profiles, name, address, pics & More!\n1.Justify Cheating\nIf in any conversation your friend, date or long term partner justifies themselves cheating in the past or a friend of theirs cheating then this means they could justify themselves cheating on you in the future. A cheater is always responsible for their actions, regardless of what made them cheat they are responsible for there actions, responsible for the hurt that was created and responsible for the aftermath. Yes, there are \"excuses\" that maybe could have avoided cheating but the bottom line is that it is not acceptable or justifiable. They should always speak up in the relationship before infidelity occurs and discuss with their partner what is wrong and what they as a couple need to work on.\n2.Scared To Be Alone\nThe fear of being alone is one of the common habits that cheaters have, they express this habit by always having people around them. They might even seem pushy or controlling when asking friends to hangout. They want to control and manipulate people into always being with them. This type of person might even ask their friends for help with things they don't really need help with. The deeper cause for this is called \"abandonment issues\" and they think that if they have multiple intimate relationships they will never actually be abandoned by anyone, the downside to this is that they are more likely to be left due to all the lying and manipulating.\n3.Keep Their Personal Lives Private\nThink about a friend of yours or someone you dated where you literally have never met their parents or close family. Now, remember why? Its because their parents and family know all the dirty secrets, lies and bad stories about this person. Keeping their personal life private is one of the habits that cheaters have, they do this so that you won't find out about the countless boyfriends or girlfriends they have had, the lies they have told their own parents or the warnings to you from their family telling you to be careful.\n4.Hide Their Phone or Wont Use It Around You\nHiding their phone is one of the habits that cheaters have, if they are hanging out with you they will keep their phone in the car or in their pocket on silent. That way you won't notice all the texts or phone calls from their other intimate partners. If you ask to use their phone or why they never have it with them they might use the excuse that they are trying to stay away from tech so they can be more present with you. This might be true but if any of the other signs of a cheater appear it's more likely they are lying.\nGet an Instant Online Background Check\n\nQuestion: What is the fear that cheaters who are scared to be alone often exhibit?\nAnswer: They fear being alone and try to control others to avoid it.", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "b2468637-0f8c-4ab3-8ba0-c4c554b7203b", "url": "https://truthscouts.com/blog/7-habits-that-cheaters-have/"}
{"text": "The FCC defines CBSDs as devices GAA and PAL tiers use to access the CBRS spectrum. CBSDs can also be referred to as Access Points (APs) or Radios. CBSDs may be a microcell or the combination of a Remote Radio Head (RRH) and a Base Band Unit (BBU). CBSDs are required to be certified with the FCC and comply with technical and operational requirements. For CBSDs to utilize the CBRS spectrum, authorization via a grant process must be followed.\nThe SAS manages spectrum access by issuing grants to CBRS users. CBSDs must register with the SAS and request access to specific frequencies. The SAS evaluates requests based on factors like interference management and spectrum availability and, if approved, issues a grant. CBSDs must regularly communicate with the SAS through a heartbeat process to maintain their active grant status.\nCoordinated Periodic Activity among Sasses (CPAS) is a nightly process where all SASs share information and coordinate their efforts to enforce spectrum management rules and maintain a harmonized ecosystem for CBRS operators.\nEnvironmental Sensing Capability (ESC) is a network of sensors deployed along the U.S. coastline that detects the presence of incumbent users, particularly federal radar systems, in the CBRS band. The ESC provides real-time information to the SAS, which adjusts spectrum access for PAL and GAA users to prevent interference.\nCBSD Categories refer to the classification of CBSDs based on their power levels and deployment scenarios. The two main categories are Category A and Category B:\nCategory A: These devices are lower-power CBSDs intended for indoor use. They have a maximum EIRP of 30 dBm/10 MHz. Category A devices are often used in smaller coverage areas, such as within buildings. If installed outdoors, Category A CBSDs must not have antennas over 6 meters high; if they do, they'll be classified and regulated as Category B CBSDs.\nCategory B: These devices are higher-power CBSDs for outdoor use. They have a maximum EIRP of 47 dBm/10 MHz with antennas installed at a minimum height of 6 meters (19.685 feet) above ground level (AGL). Category B devices are typically deployed in wider coverage areas and are used to provide broader network coverage.\nA Domain Proxy (DP) is a middleman in CBRS networks that facilitates communication between CBSDs and the SAS. It is located on the network's core (EPC) and manages key processes, including the aggregation of requests and responses. By acting as a single point of contact between CBSDs and the SAS, the Domain Proxy simplifies communication, reduces overhead, and streamlines the coordination of multiple CBSDs with the SAS.\nA CBRS cellular network is a communication system that enables wireless connectivity for users within a geographical area on the CBRS spectrum. The network is designed to accommodate numerous simultaneous connections. The foundation of the network relies on three main components:\nUser Equipment (UE): UE devices, also referred to as mobile devices, send and receive signals to and from the Radio Access Network (RAN). Examples include smartphones, tablets, cellular routers, and IoT devices.\n\nQuestion: What is the minimum antenna height requirement for Category B CBSDs? Answer: 6 meters (19.685 feet) above ground level (AGL)\n\nQuestion: Which devices are classified as Category A CBSDs?

If anything, I'd say this university is biased against Euro-Americans, since they threatened me with punishment for reporting harassment and assault that was aimed at me just for being there.

{"text": "Announcement\n2017-October-25\nHadrons or Leptons? That is the question!\nWritten by Fabrizio Tavecchio & Stefano Vercellone\nThis Chandra image of the nearby galaxy Centaurus A provides one of the best views to date of the effects of an active supermassive black hole. Opposing jets of high-energy particles can be seen extending to the outer reaches of the galaxy. Image credit: NASA/CXC/CfA.\nExtragalactic (from outside our galaxy) jets shine across the entire electromagnetic spectrum, emitting radiation from radio waves up to very high-energy gamma rays. In the past decades, astrophysicists have been able to grasp several aspects of the functioning of these structures, thought to be launched by rotating magnetic fields close to the horizon of supermassive black holes.\nOne of the most basic questions about jets is the one related to the nature of the radiating particles and the mechanisms at the base of the emission that we observe. While there is wide consensus on the fact that the radiation at the lowest frequencies (from radio up to soft X-rays) originates from electrons spiraling in the jet magnetic field (synchrotron radiation), more debated is the source of the photons detected as gamma rays. It is often assumed that the main emitters are electrons (leptons), producing gamma rays through the scattering of low-energy photons (inverse Compton emission). On the other hand, there are also several supporters of the alternative idea, the hadronic scenario, which envisions gamma rays as the by-product of reactions initiated by protons (or other nuclei) smashing into other nuclei or low-energy photons. The idea is quite appealing: the discovery of the presence of protons accelerated to the highest energies could also open the way to the identification of the still mysterious sources of the ultra-high-energy cosmic rays that bombard the Earth's atmosphere.\nThe difference between the properties of the radiation deriving from the two processes is quite minute. Only with very accurate measurements of the spectrum at TeV energies can one hope to firmly identify the underlying emitters (see below figure). Current Cherenkov telescopes do not have the sensitivity required for this difficult task. CTA, with its improved sensitivity, will be able to provide a definite answer to the question. In fact, this is one of the goals of CTA's active galactic nuclei (AGN) key science project, which foresees the accurate spectral measurement of blazars, hosting powerful jets pointing at the Earth.\n\nQuestion: What is the main topic of the text?

{"text": "Hoarding Cleanup - The Role OCD Plays\nWe've all seen images of hoarded homes on TV or heard stories of city officials evicting residents from their property because they've allowed too much junk to accumulate. It may be easy to dismiss hoarding behavior as pure laziness; people should know better than to allow their lives to be taken over by possessions, much of which is no more than junk. Yet to do so dismisses the possibility that such behavior may be beyond a person's ability to control.\nFor the longest time, those who hoarded were classified as people who chose to live on the fringes of society, using their overgrown collections to keep people away. What wasn't understood was the possible psychological cause behind such behavior. Now, it has been discovered that many of those who hoard also display the classic symptoms of obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD).\nWhat is OCD?\nOCD is an anxiety disorder that is estimated to affect 1 in 40 adults, and 1 in 100 children have this condition. As the name implies, those who suffer from OCD have issues in dealing with both obsession and compulsions, which are defined as follows:\nMany who suffer from OCD will repeat tasks over and over long after the objective is done. The repetition, which should be a comfort as a comfort to them, in many cases, has the opposite effect: it serves to convince them of the futility of their pursuit, causing them to experience depression. They then feel as though the only way to solve that depression is to keep repeating the task to excess.\nWhy OCD Can Cause Hoarding\nIn the case of hoarding, the hoarder feels as though their depression can only be solved through the accumulation of more \"stuff.\" That \"stuff\" can include:\n• Clothing • Collectibles • Books Or any number of items that many would term trash – newspapers,boxes, milk cartons, even recycling.\nYet, the more \"stuff\" a hoarder collects, the further away he or she feels from receiving comfort. Thus, the collecting goes into overdrive, reaching a point where the \"stuff\" fills all corners of their homes and lives, making it almost impossible to function.\nIn other cases, hoarders obsess over losing items, needing them in the future or have plans to use the item for another purpose, and thus choose to never discard them. In such cases, these people are often found to be living in trash piles. In these cases, hoarders may fight to keep their treasures from being thrown out.\nHow to Help a Hoarder\nHoarding is no laughing matter, and hoarders should not be subjected to mocking and ridicule. In many of the hoarding cleanup cases we've assisted with, a gentle hand extended in caring and friendship is all that's needed to help hoarders move on with their lives and begin recovery. Bio-One even has clients that we help on a regular basis to help maintain their reclaimed homes\nEmergency Response Hotline\nGet in touch with our 24/7 biohazard & crime scene cleaning team today\n\nQuestion: What services does Bio-One provide? Answer: Bio-One provides biohazard and crime scene cleaning services, including assistance with hoarding cleanup cases.\n\nQuestion: How does OCD relate to hoarding behavior? Answer: OCD can cause hoarding by making individuals feel that they need to accumulate more items to ease their depression or anxiety about losing or discarding items.\n\nQuestion: Is there a 24/7 emergency response hotline provided by Bio-One? Answer: Yes, Bio-One has a 24/7 biohazard and crime scene cleaning team that can be reached through their emergency response hotline.\n\nQuestion: What is the recommended approach to help a hoarder? Answer: A gentle and caring approach, offering friendship and support, is recommended.

(Read This First shrinkage and loss of skin.\nThe biggest crocodiles in the world are found in Africa and Asia, with the largest being the Great White Shark (Carcharodon carcharias) of the Indian Ocean, which can weigh up to 1,000 kg (2,500 lb). .Is a saltwater crocodile as big as a bus?\nScientists have discovered what may be the largest marine crocodile that ever lived, a monstrous predator as long as a bus that crunched up and ate sea turtles.\nThe new species, which was discovered off the coast of South Africa, is estimated to have weighed up to 1,000 kilograms (2,500 pounds) and had a head the size of a football field, according to a new study published in the journal ZooKeys. It is the first time that a marine reptile has been found with such a large head, the researchers said.\n\"This is one of the biggest crocodiles we've ever seen,\" study co-author David Evans, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Adelaide in Australia, told Live Science in an email.\nAre saltwater crocodiles aggressive?\nThe study showed that baby saltwater crocodiles have the same level of aggressiveness as adults who spend their entire lives in the wild. The saltwater crocodile has a reputation for being one of the most aggressive species in captivity, according to Matthew Brien, who led the research.\nThe researchers also found that the aggressive behavior of baby crocodylians is not limited to the breeding season. The researchers speculate that this may be due to a combination of factors, such as the fact that crocodilians are more active during this time of year, and that they have more time to hunt and forage for food.\nWho would win a Nile crocodile or a saltwater crocodile?\nIt's an average for male adult Saltwater crocodiles. If we use the average size for both, the Saltwater croc will be twice the mass and be able to eat twice as much food. They can grow up to 3 feet in length and weigh more than a ton. Their diet consists of fish, crustaceans, amphibians, reptiles, birds, mammals, and fish eggsWhat is the largest crocodile on earth?\nThe estuarine or saltwater crocodile (crocodylus porosus) is the largest crocodilian in the world and can be found throughout the tropical regions of asia and the pacific, as well as the indian and pacific ocean. It is also found in Africa, the Middle East, and South America. They can live up to 30 years in captivity.\nIs crocodile skin bulletproof?\nEven though a crocodile does not have a bulletproof body, they can survive a lot of powerful shots due to the thick layer of skin and scales. They can be killed by shots on their vital parts. Crocodiles are not the only animals that can be shot with a bow and arrow.\n\nQuestion: What is the estimated weight of the largest marine crocodile ever discovered? Answer: Up to 1,000 kilograms (2,500 pounds)\n\nQuestion: Are saltwater crocodiles more aggressive than other crocodilians? Answer: Yes, they are known for being one of the most aggressive species in captivity.\n\nQuestion: Can a saltwater crocodile grow as large as a bus? Answer: Yes, the largest saltwater crocodiles can reach lengths comparable to a bus.\n\nQuestion: Which crocodile species is larger on average, the Nile crocodile or the saltwater crocodile? Answer: The saltwater crocodile is larger on average.", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "bc2d4aa4-5239-4f06-93ae-d1802a49f2df", "url": "https://www.reptilesfreak.com/how-big-is-a-saltwater-crocodile/"}
{"text": "It is also important to consider the timing of meals and snacks in relation to training and competition. Eating a meal too close to exercise can cause discomfort and affect performance, while not eating enough can lead to fatigue and decreased endurance. It is recommended to eat a meal containing carbohydrates, protein, and healthy fats 2-3 hours before exercise, and to consume a snack containing carbohydrates and protein 30 minutes to an hour before exercise.\nIn addition to pre-exercise nutrition, post-exercise nutrition is also crucial for recovery and muscle repair. Consuming a snack or meal containing carbohydrates and protein within 30 minutes of exercise can help replenish glycogen stores and promote muscle recovery. It is also important to continue consuming healthy sources of carbohydrates, protein, and fats throughout the day to support overall health and performance.\nPre-Race Nutrition: What to Eat Before Competing in a Triathlon\nBefore the race, it is important to eat foods that are easy to digest and provide sustained energy. A mix of complex carbohydrates and lean protein, such as oatmeal with almonds and Greek yogurt, is a good choice.\nIt is also important to stay hydrated before the race, as dehydration can lead to decreased performance and increased risk of injury. Drinking plenty of water and avoiding excessive alcohol and caffeine consumption leading up to the race can help ensure that you are well-prepared to perform at your best.\nIn addition to eating a balanced meal before the race, it is also important to consider the timing of your pre-race meal. Eating too close to the start of the race can lead to discomfort and digestive issues, while eating too far in advance can leave you feeling hungry and low on energy. Aim to eat your pre-race meal 2-3 hours before the start of the race to allow for proper digestion and energy utilization.\nAnother important factor to consider is the type of race you will be competing in. For shorter races, such as a sprint triathlon, you may not need as much fuel as you would for a longer race, such as an Ironman. Adjusting your pre-race nutrition plan based on the length and intensity of the race can help ensure that you are properly fueled and ready to perform at your best.\nHydration Strategies for Triathletes: Staying Fueled and Hydrated During Training and Competitions\nHydration is critical for all athletes, but for triathletes, it is especially important due to the length and intensity of the race. Staying hydrated throughout training and competitions can help prevent cramps, reduce fatigue, and improve overall performance.\nDrinking water and sports drinks, as well as consuming fruits and vegetables with high water content, can help ensure that you are properly hydrated. It is also important to monitor your fluid intake throughout the race, as even mild dehydration can have a significant impact on performance.\nIn addition to drinking fluids, triathletes should also consider their electrolyte intake. Electrolytes, such as sodium and potassium, are essential for proper muscle function and hydration. Sports drinks and electrolyte supplements can help replenish these important nutrients lost through sweat during training and competitions.\nThe Role of Carbohydrates, Proteins, and Fats in a Triathlete's Diet\n\nQuestion: What should you eat before a triathlon race to ensure easy digestion and sustained energy? Answer: A mix of complex carbohydrates and lean protein, such as oatmeal with almonds and Greek yogurt.\n\nQuestion: What should you consume 30 minutes to an hour before exercise? Answer: A snack containing carbohydrates and protein.\n\nQuestion: Should you eat a meal containing carbohydrates, protein, and healthy fats immediately before exercise? Answer: No, it's recommended to eat such a meal 2-3 hours before exercise.\n\nQuestion: Which of the following is NOT a factor to consider in pre-race nutrition? A) Timing of the meal B) Type of race C) Weather conditions D) Staying hydrated Answer: C) Weather conditions", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "dd0f1385-3a54-452f-a529-5029a752bdd3", "url": "https://atlasbars.com/blogs/nutrition-explained/nutrition-for-triathletes-sustaining-energy-across-multiple-disciplines"}

{"text": "Cataplexy, another hallmark symptom of narcolepsy, involves sudden muscle weakness or paralysis triggered by strong emotions, such as laughter, anger, or surprise. These episodes can be brief or prolonged, and they can significantly impact emotional well-being. Individuals with cataplexy often have to avoid situations or activities that may trigger these episodes, leading to a sense of restriction and isolation.\nThe fear of experiencing cataplexy can also cause anxiety and emotional distress, as individuals may become hyperaware of their emotions and constantly monitor their reactions. This heightened emotional vigilance can disrupt daily life, affecting relationships, work performance, and overall quality of life. Managing cataplexy often involves a combination of medication and therapy to help individuals cope with their emotions and reduce the frequency and severity of episodes.\nThe Struggles with Sleep Fragmentation\nIn addition to EDS and cataplexy, individuals with narcolepsy often experience fragmented sleep. They may have difficulty maintaining a consistent sleep schedule and may wake up frequently throughout the night. This disrupted sleep pattern can lead to chronic sleep deprivation, exacerbating the symptoms of narcolepsy and further impacting daily life.\nSleep fragmentation can result in decreased cognitive function, impaired memory and concentration, and difficulties with problem-solving and decision-making. It can also contribute to mood disturbances, such as irritability, anxiety, and depression. Establishing a regular sleep routine, creating a comfortable sleep environment, and practicing good sleep hygiene are essential for managing sleep fragmentation and improving overall sleep quality.\nStrategies for Managing Narcolepsy Symptoms\n1. Medication: Various medications, such as stimulants and antidepressants, are prescribed to manage narcolepsy symptoms. These medications can help promote wakefulness, reduce cataplexy episodes, and improve overall sleep quality.\n4. Support network: Building a support network of understanding family members, friends, and healthcare professionals can provide emotional support and practical assistance in managing narcolepsy.\n5. Education and awareness: Increasing awareness and understanding about narcolepsy can help reduce stigma and promote acceptance and support for individuals living with the condition.\nConclusion\nLiving with narcolepsy can present numerous challenges, from excessive daytime sleepiness and cataplexy to sleep fragmentation. However, with proper management strategies and support, individuals with narcolepsy can lead fulfilling lives and overcome the obstacles associated with this sleep disorder. By understanding the impact of narcolepsy on daily life and implementing effective coping mechanisms, individuals can navigate the challenges and embrace a balanced lifestyle.\nKey Takeaways: How does narcolepsy affect daily life?\nNarcolepsy can cause excessive daytime sleepiness, making it difficult to stay awake and alert throughout the day.\nNarcolepsy can lead to sudden and uncontrollable sleep attacks, which can happen at any time and in any situation.\nPeople with narcolepsy may experience cataplexy, a sudden loss of muscle tone triggered by strong emotions.\nNarcolepsy can impact daily activities such as driving, working, and socializing due to the unpredictable nature of symptoms.\nWith proper management and treatment, individuals with narcolepsy can lead fulfilling lives and minimize the impact on daily activities.\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\nQuestion: How can proper management and treatment help individuals with narcolepsy?

{"text": "Important UNIX Files and their Permissions\nEarly Unix systems were mainly commercial commodities like most software for sale; to run the operating system, you generally had to pay for that right. In 1984 an engineer named Richard Stallman began work on the GNU Project, which was an effort to create an operating system that was like Unix and that could be distributed and used freely by anyone. He currently runs the Free Software Foundation, and many of the programs he and his supporters have created are used in both commercial and open-source versions of Unix.\nIn 1991 Linus Torvalds, a Finnish graduate student, began work on a Unix-like system called Linux. Linux is actually the kernel, while the parts with which most people are familiar—the tools, shell, and file system—are the creations of others (usually the GNU organization).\nAs the Linux project gained momentum, it grew into a major contender in the Unix market. Many people are first introduced to Unix through Linux, which makes available to desktop machines the functionality of a Unix machine that used to costs thousands of dollars. The strength of Linux lies in its progressive licensing, which allows for the software to be freely distributable with no royalty requirements.\nThe permissions of a file are the first line of defense in the security of a Unix system. The basic building blocks of Unix permissions are the read, write, and execute permissions, which are described in the following table:\nPermission\nApplied to a Directory\nApplied to Any Other Type of File\nread (r)\nGrants the capability to read the contents of the directory or subdirectories.\nGrants the capability to view the file.\nwrite (w)\nGrants the capability to create, modify, or remove files or subdirectories.\nGrants write permissions, allowing an authorized entity to modify the file, such as by adding text to a text file, or deleting the file.\nexecute (x)\nGrants the capability to enter the directory.\nAllows the user to \"run\" the program.\n–\nNo permission.\nNo permission.\nTo change file or directory permissions, you use the chmod (change mode) command. There are two ways to use chmod: symbolic mode and absolute mode.\nApplying permissions with chmod's absolute mode requires a numerical representation of the permissions, which is more efficient and is how the system views permissions. Permissions applied with chmod's symbolic mode use the familiar rwx format and are easier to understand for most new users.\nA file system is a component of Unix that enables the user to view, organize, secure, and interact with files and directories that are located on storage devices.\nEverything in Unix is considered to be a file, including physical devices such as DVD-ROMs, USB devices, floppy drives, and so forth. This use of files allows Unix to be consistent in its treatment of resources and gives the user a consistent mechanism of interaction with the system. It's easy to understand, then, why file systems are an integral part of a Unix operating system.\nHere is the complete list of UNIX File structure and their recommended permissions:\n\nQuestion: What are physical devices like DVD-ROMs, USB devices, and floppy drives considered as in Unix?

{"text": "Mapping New York Literary History\nOrchard Beach, also known as the Bronx or Puerto Rican Riviera, is a man-made beach situated along the Long Island Sound in Pelham Bay Park. It spans 115 acres and is over a mile long with a promenade that allows beachgoers to walk up and down the beach without having to tiptoe on the burning sand on hot days. People who'd rather sit in the shade set up camp on the wide patches of green lawns dotted with picnic tables next to the beach, or under the trees at the edge of Pelham Bay Park, a forested area filled with marshes, swamps and wildlife three times larger than Manhattan's Central Park. The beach itself is crescent-shaped with a rock jetty on the northern tip that points out to the Atlantic Ocean. City Island can be seen a mile away.\nGetting its start in the 1930s when Parks Commissioner Robert Moses invested $8 million to develop the area into a public beach, adding sand from the Rockaways in Queens and Sandy Hook, New Jersey, Orchard Beach grew to become a haven for Puerto Ricans living in New York. \"From the 1960's on,\" reports a 2000 New York Times article, \"as waves of Puerto Ricans sought new lives in the Bronx, the beach became known to many as the Puerto Rican Riviera. These days, musicians with congas and maracas wail away on the boardwalk, singing Afro-Cuban music, while families lugging containers with garlicky chicken and rice and beans carve out their own terrain among the sea of people who arrive on weekends\" (\"Slice\"). Orchard Beach went through a state of decline during the '70s when budget cuts led to cutbacks in maintenance and patrolling, resulting in the beach losing much of its luster, but it has bounced back in the last 25 years.\nThe beach is quiet during the off-season. Few people linger to take in the view until Memorial Day Weekend when the beach opens and it's filled with city-folk wanting to escape from the \"concrete jungle\" and take a cool dip in the water. When they come to the beach, there will be amenities available for them, along with familiar landmarks such as the central pavilion, which holds food stands, and the stage under a white tent that plays salsa music during the height of summer. For Bronxites, it's their own Cape Cod, but for displaced Puerto Ricans, it serves as a replacement for the home and identity they long for.\n\nQuestion: Which two places did the sand for Orchard Beach come from?

Although, that is not the case, but, I understand why people latch onto that idea.\nThe very important detail that most people miss is that Gen 1:27 does not deliver anyone or anything onto the earth. So, even if a person ignores the context of Gen 6, and takes this out of order in isolation it is describing something happening on the earth, where as Gen 1:27 is not happening on the earth.\ninReally, \"all the othe people groups\"? That sounds exaggerated. All of them? As you are probably aware the greek word being translated as \"giants\" is not always a physical giant. For example, take a look at Isaiah 13:3 in greek, or maybe Ezekiel 32:12. This is supported by the JPS which clarifies that the verse is speaking of men of renown.In order to make the connection a rather large adjustment is needed to the story? Ra becomes the Egyptian nobles? That's kind of a stretch. Normal modern people become men of renown? That's the opposite.So even if we're talking about a physical creation, it would be the image of an image, or the shadow of a shadow, or the echo of an echoMixing in the Kjv is not the best idea. Naturally they will translate encouraging a \"god in the flesh\".Many people in error give the enuma elish a very early date but that is not the version that is being compared to GenesisReally, \"all the othe people groups\"? That sounds exaggerated.

Inflicting punishment…the third and fourth generation: the intended emphasis is on God's mercy by the contrast between punishment and mercy (\"to the thousandth generation\"—v. 6).

Yet it is known that later generations may suffer the punishing effects of sins of earlier generations, but not the guilt.\n* [20:7] In vain: i.e., to no good purpose, a general framing of the prohibition which includes swearing falsely, especially in the context of a legal proceeding, but also goes beyond it (cf.

The term may originally have designated any killing of another Israelite, including acts of manslaughter, for which the victim's kin could exact vengeance.

{"text": "Navigating the bustling intersections of traditional banking and cryptocurrency can be a journey filled with questions. Particularly, when attempting to acquire trending tokens like DODO through established institutions such as Wintrust Financial, one needs a roadmap. This guide will answer those burning queries: from direct DODO purchases at Wintrust, the dynamics of using Wintrust's debit/credit cards across prominent crypto exchanges like Bitfinex and Huobi, to the feasibility of leveraging bank transfers. Plus, we'll touch on any potential limitations that Wintrust might have in place for daily DODO transactions and explore the depth of their online banking support for this specific crypto coin. Ready to uncover these nuances? Let's dive right in.\nCan I buy DODO directly from Wintrust Financial?\nThe crypto revolution has forced traditional banks to sit up and take notice. Historically, many banks observed the wild crypto ride from a safe distance, occasionally showing skepticism. A friend of mine, Tom, who's now a crypto whiz, once went to his bank to discuss Bitcoin in 2010. The manager chuckled, implying it was just a passing fad. Oh, how times have changed!\nThe Real Scoop on Wintrust & DODO Purchases\nNow, as for Wintrust Financial, there's been some buzz in crypto circles. Word on the street is, can one directly procure DODO tokens through Wintrust? If I had a dollar for every time I got this query!\nFor the uninitiated, DODO is not your typical bird, but a prized token in the vast crypto landscape. Now, if you're banking with Wintrust and have dreams of DODO tokens dancing in your head, here's the cold, hard truth: Wintrust Financial, as of my last research update, does not directly facilitate the purchase of DODO tokens. Yes, it's a bummer, especially with DODO's meteoric rise and popularity among crypto aficionados.\nWhy the Standoff?\nThough traditional banks have warmed up to the idea of crypto, direct token purchases remain a rare phenomenon. Wintrust might have its reasons, be it regulatory concerns, risk management, or simply waiting for the right time to dive into the deep end. But let's not lose hope. The crypto wave is unstoppable, and even traditional banking giants might have to ride it sooner than they think.\nRemember, the crypto space is dynamic, and while Bitcheke is my go-to for the latest, always keep your ears to the ground and eyes on official announcements.

{"text": "Believed to be a sign of fortune, if your right eye twitches between 3pm and 5pm it could indicate an upcoming positive event. However, the exact interpretation differs from culture to culture, so consulting local superstitions is advised. In some countries, a female right eye twitch from 3-5pm is associated with good luck in financial aspects or the arrival of unexpected news. It can also represent imminent success in career goals or signify that you will receive praise for your work shortly. On the flip side, some cultures consider this particular time frame as bad luck when it comes to health and wellbeing. If you have been feeling unwell recently, then this could possibly signal an upcoming health setback. Ultimately though, these superstitions should not be taken too seriously and should only be used as guidance when making important decisions in life.\nFemale right eye twitches at Rooster hour (from 5pm to 7pm)\nYour right eye twitching between 5pm and 7pm, known as the Rooster hour, could be interpreted differently depending on your culture. In some cultures, it is believed that a twitch of the right eye brings bad luck or an upcoming difficult situation. In others, it is seen as a sign of good luck and positive energy coming into your life. On the other hand, some believe that any twitch regardless of time or location has no real meaning at all – it's just an involuntary reaction caused by fatigue or stress. To be sure what the twitch means for you personally, pay attention to how you feel emotionally in the moment and whether any changes happen in your life shortly after. Additionally, consulting with an experienced medical practitioner may help you determine if there are physical causes for your eye twitching such as allergies or dry eyes.\nFemale right eye twitches at the time of the Dog (from 19:00 to 21:00 p.m.)\nAt the time of the Dog, from 19:00 to 21:00 p.m., superstition says a female's right eye twitching may have different meanings. According to Chinese astrology, it signifies that a woman will experience good luck and fortune in business and career. It is also believed that if her right eye twitches at this hour then she may expect visitors or news from afar. Additionally, some cultures suggest that it could mean an upcoming fight or argument with someone close to her. On the other hand, others think it means she should be cautious in whatever venture she is undertaking as something unexpected might happen in near future.

{"text": "Answer: Typically, the approach to study and discuss monopoly bases on the firms' behaviors in pursuit of maximizing monopolistic profit. In particular, the monopolist's profit maximization is derived and interpreted through the first-order condition, which is the quantity of output that marginal revenue equals to marginal costs (Mankiw, 2012: 283). Following the above logic above, the discussion of maximization of monopoly profit is usually conducted by the mathematical equation and figure, which contains curves of demand, average cost, marginal cost, and marginal revenue. Different from the standard approach, the module of \"Theoretical Foundation of Economic Policy\" chose a different way to discuss monopoly. This module's discussion on monopoly relied on case analysis.\nMonopolistic competition firms might maximize profit or minimize loss in the short run. The firms that under monopolistic competition used this strategy as the production of output where the marginal revenue is equal to the marginal cost (MR = MC).\nPerfect competition is a type of market structre where there is highest level of competition. In perfect competition the firms are offering homogeneous product. Every firm believe that it can sell any amount of output it wishes at the prevailing market price. Because of homogenous product and large number of firms, no individual firm is in a position to effect the price of the product and therefore the demand curve for the firm under perfect competition is a horizontal straight line.\nThe theory of pure competition is a theory that is built on four assumptions: (1.)There are many sellers and many buyers, none of which is large in relation to total sales or purchases. (2.) Each firm produces and sells a homogeneous product. (3.) Buyers and sellers have all relevant information about prices, product quality, sources of supply, and so forth. (4.) Firms have easy entry and exit.\nThere are several characteristics of a monopoly. Firstly, extreme economies of scale are available to monopolist firms, giving them a huge advantage over any other company. Because of this and relatively low costs despite large product ranges, supernormal profits are achieved. Another characteristic is the inelastic demand for these firm's products.\nUnlike the theoretical perfect competition market, Oligopolies exist in real life. A market structure that is dominated by two companies is known as a duopoly. An example of an oligopoly is the soft drinks market that is dominated by Coca-Cola and Pepsi (Zheng, 2013). Oligopolies can be categorized according to the type of product they produce. The products may be either homogeneous or differentiated. On the one hand, Homogeneous products are produced by a standardized or a pure oligopoly. On the other hand, a differentiated oligopoly produces different products (William & Allan, 2011).\nWithin monopolistic firms there are a large number of organizations that operate within the industry which are independent from each other. The decision of one firm in the market has no significant effect on the demand curves of its rivals. There is also freedom of entry into the industry. The firms within an industry offer product differentiation, where one firm's product is amply diverse from its competitor 's products, in order to allow raises in price without customers converting to alternate products.\n\nQuestion: What is the difference between a homogeneous oligopoly and a differentiated oligopoly? Answer: A homogeneous oligopoly produces standardized products, while a differentiated oligopoly produces different products.\n\nQuestion: What is one of the characteristics of a monopoly? Answer: Extreme economies of scale are available to monopolist firms, allowing them to achieve supernormal profits.", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "f9a08338-489d-435f-9775-fa9acf3109cf", "url": "https://www.bartleby.com/essay/The-Various-Shades-Of-Monopolies-And-Perfect-PK4PZG39DEHW"}
{"text": "Countries around the world have always made strict laws and restrictions on the subject of gun control. While these countries have made efforts to restrict or ban the use of guns by civilians, the US has taken a different stand altogether by guaranteeing it as a constitutional right. Over the years, this has been a reason not only for debate but also for increased violence. The times were different when the US Constitution recognized the right of citizens to bear arms as a constitutional right. It was during this time when wars were frequent and countries had to make efforts to give priority to military forces in order to ensure the safety and security of the nation. But with the changing times, the right became a promoter of self-defense. People were given the right to own and use guns and weapons in self-defense.\nThis has also given rise to violence in the state. Murders and homicides by firearms and guns have become so high that the US has the highest number of killings by firearms among developed nations. Yet, the government was silent for all these years about gun control regulations in the US because the opinions have always been divergent. Supporters of owning arms believe that if the state restricts people from owning guns, it would lead to increased crimes and restrict law-abiding citizens from defending themselves. It will render them defenseless. Whereas, opposers believe that not regulating gun laws in the US has led to an increased number of crimes and that making laws to control them will save many lives.\nWhile gun violence occurs almost every day in the US, many cases go unreported because of this high frequency. The ones that become extremely heinous and cause mass killings get reported. In one such incident in 2012, 20 children and 6 adults in an elementary school in Newtown, Connecticut were murdered by gun violence. Another instance took place in 2016 when 49 people were killed in an Orlando nightclub.\nTwo massively worse incidents of all time took place recently in March 2022, one in Atlanta and another in Colorado. On March 22, 2022, an open fire took place in a grocery store in which 10 people were killed, including a police officer. Before this, another incident took place on March 16th in Atlanta, where 8 people were killed by a man in three different spa locations. Six of them were Asian women.

{"text": "History and Curiosities of Checkers\nThe game of Checkers is one of the oldest and most popular board games in the world. It is played all over the world and has been enjoyed by millions of people for centuries. In this article, we present you with a complete guide to the game, along with the history and curiosities of Checkers. We explain all the differences between the variations, which may be interesting for fans of this classic game.\nHistory of Checkers\nThe game of Checkers has a long and rich history dating back to ancient Rome. The Romans played a game called Ludus Latrunculorum, which means \"soldier's game\" in Latin. This game was played on an 8×8 board and the pieces were men and women, representing soldiers and their wives.\nOver time, the game was adapted and evolved in different parts of the world. In the Middle Ages, the game became popular in Europe and the pieces changed to become the Checkers we know today.\nAs we said, we will talk about the history and curiosities of Checkers, therefore, here are some very interesting facts about this game.\nInteresting facts about Checkers\nIn the game of Checkers, the player who starts always has an advantage, since he can move first and control the rhythm of the game.\nIn 1847, the English Checkers championship was played on a 10×10 board instead of the traditional 8×8 board.\nIn 1952, Marion Tinsley, a mathematician at Ohio University, won the US Checkers National Championship, becoming the youngest player to win the championship.\nIn 1994, the Chinook computer program became the first computer program to win a Checkers tournament, winning the International Checkers Association's \"World Checkers Championship\".\nCheckers is one of the most studied and analyzed games in game theory, and many strategies and tactics have been developed to play it at an expert level.\nBasic rules of Checkers\nThe traditional version of Checkers is played on an 8×8 board and each player starts with 12 pieces, which are placed on the dark squares in the three rows closest to each player. The object of the game is to capture all of the opponent's pieces or block them so that they cannot move.\nEach player moves one piece at a time, diagonally on a single free space. If an opponent's piece is diagonally adjacent to one's own piece and there is a free space behind the opponent's piece, the player can jump over the opponent's piece and capture it. If there are more captures possible, the player can choose which one to make.\nQueens are attained when reaching the other end of the opponent's board. Queens have a special move and can move diagonally in any direction, rather than just one direction.\nVariations of Checkers\nWhen discussing the history and curiosities of Checkers, we must also consider the different variations of the game.\n\nQuestion: What is the objective of the game in Checkers? Answer: To capture all of the opponent's pieces or block them so that they cannot move.\n\nQuestion: In which year did the Chinook computer program win the International Checkers Association's \"World Checkers Championship\"? Answer: 1994.\n\nQuestion: Who were the pieces representing in the ancient Roman game Ludus Latrunculorum? Answer: Soldiers and their wives.", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "990bb21f-5568-4f85-b222-ca2b0ae95342", "url": "https://torofun.com/en/blog/history-and-curiosities-of-checkers/"}
{"text": "Cisco Anyconnect not resuming after computer sleep over non-vpn firewall\nI have an ASA5516X running 9.5(3) without a VPN configuration but a user pointed out to me that she needs to reconnect her Anyconnect VPN after computer sleeps when on a WLAN passing traffic through the aforementioned ASA while the problem isn't present at home or other locations. Is there any setting I can adjust in order to allow the VPN to resume?\nThe thing that pops to mind is that I have a one hour DHCP lease but also a high client turnover so it makes sens to keep it low.\nI'm unfortunately not able to provide details about the Anyconnect setup as it's maintained by a 3rd party.\nOne possibility could be the TCP timeout, which by default is set to 1 hour on the ASA. So if the devices goes to sleep and comes back up after an hour, it might not have an established connection through the ASA, which might require it to start a new connection again. You can set a separate timeout for different traffic flows using MPF on the ASA rather than changing the global default.\nI guess what I don't like about it is that the anyconnect TCP connection is over SSL 443 so it will include all https traffic. It might make more sense to add the IP addresses of the VPN servers instead but then it requires manual work every time someone has a different VPN provider. There isn't any way to do this by traffic classification, I noted ipsec-pass-thru is available for inspection but would there be some way of adding different timeout based on that?\n\nQuestion: Who maintains the Anyconnect setup?

{"text": "High humidity helps to keep temperatures lower, and prevents too much moisture loss from the the plant. Running a humidifier in hot weather can help prevent brown spots showing up on peace lily leaves.\nDoes high humidity in hot weather make the environment uninhabitable for humans? Yes, but don't worry, your peace lily doesn't care.\nMinimum temperature\nAs stated above, 18˚C/65˚F is the minimum recommended temperature for peace lilies if you want them to grow.\nHowever, my home regularly gets WAY below 18˚C in the winter, especially at night. This can send tropical houseplants into situational dormancy.\nThis just means that plants that don't have a 'proper' dormancy period and are naturally evergreen, will go into a dormancy-like state (i.e. they won't grow) until their situation improves.\nProvided you continue to care for them well over winter, they won't deteriorate much.\nI can't find any actual research into just how cold peace lilies can get before they suffer permanent damage, BUT they can definitely survive around 11˚C/51˚F.\nIf your peace lily does get frost-damaged, then it could still be ok. Cut off any damaged leaves, keep it somewhere warm, and hope it regrows in the spring. Soil retains heat quite well, so one night spent in the frost doesn't necessarily mean it's game over.\nCaring for a peace lily in hot weather\nHow to tell if your peace lily is too hot\nMost plants droop when they're too hot. There are two reasons for this:\nReduced turgor pressure\nPlants rely on water pressure (called turgor pressure) to give them structural integrity and keep their leaves from drooping. In hot weather, they lose a lot of water through their stomata, and therefore the pressure is reduced.\nAn attempt to reduce surface area\nPlants droop their leaves in hot weather to try to reduce their surface area and prevent water being lost through their stomata. Peace lilies wilt very dramatically when they're hot, whereas other plants like Calathea roll their leaves up to try to reabsorb any water lost through their leaves.\nHow to cool your peace lily down\nTake it out of direct light\nMist it – this will make it close its stomata as well as physically cooling it down\nKeep the soil moist – you can add extra coir or moss to the top to prevent it from drying out too quickly\nCaring for a peace lily in cold weather\nHow to tell if your peace lily is too cold\nAgain, annoyingly, plants tend to droop when they're cold. You may also see blackening on the leaves if it's got significant cold or frost damage.\nIf you suspect cold damage, always check the roots – the signs of cold shock and root damage are very similar.\nHow to protect your peace lily from the cold\n\nQuestion: Does high humidity in hot weather make the environment uninhabitable for humans? Answer: No, it does not. The text only discusses the effect on peace lilies.\n\nQuestion: What are the signs of a peace lily being too cold? Answer: Drooping and potential blackening on the leaves, along with possible root damage.\n\nQuestion: What is the minimum recommended temperature for peace lilies to grow? Answer: 18°C (65°F)\n\nQuestion: Can peace lilies survive temperatures below 18°C (65°F)?

{"text": "Before relative color syntax, to modify the opacity of a color, you need to create custom properties for the channels of a color, usually HSL, and assemble them into a final color and final variant color. This means managing a lot of color pieces, which can quickly become burdensome.\n/* all this work just so I can set the opacity to 50% in a variant */ --brand-color-variant:hsl(var(--brand-hsl) / 50%); }\nAfter relative color syntax, you can create a brand color with any color space or syntax you need, and create a half opacity variant with much less code. It's also much easier to read the intent of the styles and system.\nThe goal of relative color syntax is to allow deriving a color from another color. The base color is called the originating color, this is the color that comes after the new from keyword. The browser will convert and break this originating color apart and offer the parts as variables for use in the new color definition.\nThe preceding diagram shows the originating color green being converted to the new color's color space, turned into individual numbers represented as r, g, b, and alpha variables, which are then directly used as a new rgb() color's values.\nWhile this image shows the breakdown, process and variables, it's also not changing the color. The variables are put back into the color unchanged, thus resulting in a green color still.\nFor a review on specifying colors, visit the high definition color guide for all the information you need about web color. This post assumes familiarity with functional color notation, color spaces like OKLCH and color gamuts.\nThe first part of the syntax to learn is the part from <color> addition to specifying a color. It goes right before you specify the values. Here's a code example where all that has been added is from green, right before the values for rgb() are specified.\nThat from keyword, when seen as the first parameter in functional notation, turns the color definition into a relative color! After the from keyword, CSS expects a color, a color that will inspire the next color.\nReading rgb from green is very clear and easy to understand. This is why custom properties and relative color syntax make such a great match, because you can take the mystery out of the from color. You also don't generally need to know the color format of the custom property color, as you're creating a new color in a format of your choice.\nThe relative color syntax has that conversion step; the color after from is converted into the color space as specified at the beginning of the relative color. The input and output don't need to match, which is very liberating.\nThe ability to choose a color space is also empowering, as choosing a color space tends to be more focused around the type of color alternation than it is a preference. The preference is in the results, not the color format or channel types. This will become much clearer in the sections demonstrating use cases, as different color spaces excel at different tasks.\n\nQuestion: What is the term for the original color in relative color syntax? Answer: The base color is called the originating color.\n\nQuestion: What was the process to modify the opacity of a color before relative color syntax? Answer: Before relative color syntax, you needed to create custom properties for the channels of a color, usually HSL, and assemble them into a final color and final variant color.\n\nQuestion: What is the first part of the syntax to learn in relative color syntax? Answer: The first part of the syntax to learn is the part from <color> addition to specifying a color, which goes right before you specify the values.\n\nQuestion: What does the 'from' keyword do when used as the first parameter in functional notation?

{"text": "Basic Elements of a Lottery\nA lottery is a type of draw, wherein prizes are awarded by chance. When there is a high demand for something limited, a lottery may be run to make the process fair. Examples include a lottery for units in a subsidized housing block or kindergarten placements at a reputable public school.\nLotteries also occur in the financial world. In these cases, participants bet a small sum of money for the chance to win a large jackpot. The money is often a subsidy from the government, but sometimes it goes to fund other activities like schools and roads.\nThe first basic element of all lottery games is a mechanism for recording the identity and amounts of stakes by each bettor. This may take the form of a printed or digitized receipt with the bettor's name and number(s) on it. In many modern lotteries, computer programs are used for the recording of a bettor's number(s).\nSecond, there must be a means of randomly selecting the numbers or symbols that will appear in a drawing. This can be done by a pool or collection of tickets, by the shuffling of the tickets or by random number generators.\nThird, there must be a way to collect and bank the funds that are staked by each bettor. This is usually accomplished by a hierarchy of sales agents who pass the money paid for each ticket up through the organization until it has been \"banked.\"\nFinally, there must be a procedure for determining the winners. This can be done by a pool of numbers or counterfoils from which winning numbers are selected.\nThis entry was posted on Sunday, February 12th, 2023 at 12:09 am and is filed under Gambling.

{"text": "Document transcription services\nIn today's times, you will see a large number of individuals and businesses paying for professional document transcription services. A document, which is transcribed by a professional, is a text-based reproduction of a conversation or speech. One could either transcribe text from a recorded audio file or a video clip.\nA lot of people often get confused between transcription and translation. There are several differences between the two. Before you reach out to somebody for professional document transcription services, you must know what it means.\nTranscription: What Does It Mean?\nTranscription refers to the process or method of reproducing spoken word in a printed or written format. While transcribing something, you must ensure that you are doing justice to its phonological, lexical, morphological, and phonetic elements.\nIn translation, a particular written document is converted into another language. Here, both the source material and the reproduced material are in text format. That's not the case with transcription. When it comes to transcription, audio or video recording is turned into text. So, the two processes are very different from each other.\nWhat Can Be Transcribed?\nAs stated earlier, one mostly transcribes audio and video recordings. If you are planning to record a particular conversation and transcribe it later, there are a few things you must remember. Make sure there is no background noise. If there are a lot of disturbances, it would be difficult for you to make sense of the recording.\nThe quality of the recording should be good enough for you to reproduce it in printed form. Lectures, conferences, speeches, interviews, dictations, television programs, talks, and radio shows are some of the many things that you can transcribe.\nWhy Do You Need It?\nTranscription services are required in almost every industry today. Most companies and organizations need to reproduce a lot of things in written format that are originally said verbally. Whenever you go through a brochure or read a newspaper, you must know that a lot of transcription work has gone into them.\nThough the nature of the process remains the same, transcription services are used for different purposes in different industries. The media industry cannot function without transcribers. If a famous personality gives an audio interview for a print magazine, it needs to be transcribed first. After the transcription process is over, it is edited and then, published.\nThe legal world is synonymous with interrogations, depositions, memos, letters, and hearings. One needs to transcribe witness statements, victim interviews, accident reports, wiretaps, and several other things. In the healthcare industry, transcription services are extremely essential for the maintenance of medical records.\nWhether you are running a company or a working professional, you should consider hiring document translation servicesas they can help you in different ways. If you happen to look for a company offering professional translation services, you should get in touch with rockitacademix.com.\n\nQuestion: What is one of the tasks in the media industry that requires transcription services? Answer: Transcribing audio interviews for print magazines.\n\nQuestion: What is the primary difference between transcription and translation? Answer: Transcription converts spoken words into written format, while translation converts written text from one language to another.\n\nQuestion: Which company is mentioned in the text for offering professional translation services?

{"text": "Blog\n\"Wh\" of Developmental Disabilities\n\"It's Time to Focus on Abilities, Not Disabilities\"\n– Jason Steen\nMarch is Developmental Disabilities Awareness Month!\n\"Wh\" of Developmental Disabilities\nDevelopmental Disability is a term for a group of disorders that are due to cognitive or physical deficits. Additionally, they often develop in the early years of a child's growth and last throughout life. Likewise, some developmental disabilities are often present at birth. Therefore, they are detected later in life. Hence, the \"Wh\" of Developmental Disabilities blog will give you an insight.\nHow to check the risk of Developmental Disabilities?\nFirstly, every child is observed by his/her pediatrician during the growing stages. Secondly, screening for any delays in growth or red flags in the child's behavior is very crucial. Additionally, it helps for early detection and treatment. In other words, the earlier the delay is found and addressed the better is the outcome of the treatment.\nWhat are the Developmental Disabilities?\nFirstly, there are many developmental disabilities. Here are some of the developmental disabilities:\nAutism Spectrum Disorders\nAttention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder\nCerebral Palsy\nIntellectual Disabilities / Specific Learning Disabilities\nCongenital Abnormality\nDown's Syndrome\nSpoken Language Disorders\nSyndromes and Genetic Abnormalities\nLearning Disabilities\nCentral Auditory Processing Disorders\nBipolar Disorder\nHow is it diagnosed?\nFirstly, developmental Disabilities are diagnosed by a team of professionals. Hence, a multi-disciplinary will involve:\nPhysician/ Medical Practitioner\nDevelopmental Paediatrician\nGenetic Counsellor\nSpeech-Language Pathologist\nOccupational Therapist\nPhysical Therapist\nPsychologist\nWhat are the treatment options?\nThere is no known cure for developmental disabilities. However, research seems very promising.\nIn other words, Individualized Programs are the treatment option for developmental disabilities. Therefore, it is based on the disorder. After that, your physician may ask you to go to a specific professional. Furthermore, the professional will help the further growth of your child. Hence, skill-specific programs are tailor-made to suit the child's needs. In other words, these activities will focus on the functional needs of the child. In conclusion, some of the programs advised may be:\nSpeech-Language Therapy for communication development\nOccupational Therapy for functional growth\nSpecial Education for academic progress\nPhysical Therapy for motor skills\nMedications if required\nHow to support a person with Developmental Disability?\nTherefore, this March 2021, let's strive to remove barriers. Above all, aim at building a more inclusive community for all persons with developmental disabilities.\n\nQuestion: Is Down's Syndrome considered a developmental disability?

{"text": "A body wrap is a treatment that helps you get rid of toxins and have a tighter look. It eliminates dead skin cells while removing the adipose fat tissue. This leaves your skin with a smoother and softer appearance.\nFor the body to work effectively, apply heat cream to the body. In addition, the treated cream raises core body temperatures to cause you to sweat and release excessive heat. In the process, the body loses excessive water while burning a few calories. A frequent body wrap is a great way to raise body temperature momentarily.\nHot Yoga\nAlso known as Bikram Yoga, hot yoga contains different poses in a 40 degrees Celsius environment. The high-intensity yoga is a form of cardio. It helps burn fat and burn calories, which causes weight loss.\nIncreased body core temperatures lead to increased heart rate and blood flow. You can use hit yoga to raise internal body temperatures, which results from high-intensity exercise while burning calories.\nDrinking tea or coffee\nHot tea or coffee is a natural way to increase thermogenesis while boosting your body's metabolism. According to a study published in the American Journal of Nutrition, people who take up to 100 mg of caffeine had a boosted resting metabolic rate of up to 4%.\nThe same study advanced participants to consume 100 mg of caffeine every 2 hours for 12 hours, and they burned up to 150 calories.\nWhen combined with daily exercise, drinking caffeine boosts your athletic performance. The International Journal of Sports Nutrition and Exercise Metabolism shows that drinking coffee before you work out helps you exercise more.\nHot tea or coffee can boost your temperatures and metabolism with peaks of 1 to 4 hours. Before a workout, take 1 or 2 cups of hot tea or coffee for maximum performance.\nTake a cold shower\nA cold shower is a great way to boost thermogenesis. On a typical day, core body temperature may stand at 98.6 degrees. A cold shower causes your body temperatures to drop and then triggers the body to produce heat, bringing the temperature back to normal.\nTry a short cold shower for about one minute and gradually increase it to about 10 minutes of bathing time. The cold triggers the nervous system to make you alert and ready for an active day.\nThrough mental activities like meditation and forceful breathing\nAccording to research, meditation and visualization techniques help raise the body's core temperature. Some popular techniques, like g-tummo practices practiced by monks, are effective and help sustain an increased core temperature.\nThe same research further did a study on the effects of forceful breathing. Vase breathing, like meditation, further helps raise the body temperature. This way, you use your mind and breathe to maximize its potential.\nConclusion\nThe best way to raise your core body temperature is through natural means. Natural ingredients like ginger can help; placebo and pills may have an effect but are likely to cause severe side effects. Try a proper diet plan or any of the seven listed ways. Increased body temperature is an excellent way to boost your body metabolism and keep you healthy.\n\nQuestion: What does applying heat cream to the body do? Answer: It raises core body temperature.\n\nQuestion: How does hot tea or coffee help with weight loss? Answer: It boosts thermogenesis and metabolism.\n\nQuestion: What is the best way to raise core body temperature according to the text?

{"text": "We sequenced one domesticated millet accession (E. colona var. frumentacea) and two weedy accessions (E. crus-galli and E. oryzicola) to generate genomes for the three Echinochloa species.\nEchinochloa colona is an allohexaploid species, and the domesticated millet accession E. colona var. frumentacea, PI463783, was selected as a candidate representative of the E. colona genome. Var. frumentacea is cross-compatible with other varieties, such as the weedy var. colona21. The estimated genome size of var. frumentacea (PI463783), based on the k-mer survey using Illumina short reads, was ~1.18 Gb, which was consistent with its C-value of 1.30 pg/1C22. Its heterozygosity level was estimated to be 0.131%. Using 48× coverage (57.2 Gb) of PacBio HiFi reads with an average read length of 15.1 kb, a de novo assembly yielded a genome of 1.13 Gb with a contig N50 size of 24.8 Mb. The assembly was further refined using chromosome contact maps with ~100× Hi-C data. Owing to the nature of hexaploidy, the sequence similarity among the three subgenomes severely reduced the accuracy of the chromosome scaffolding using regular Hi-C-assisted methods (Supplementary Fig. 1a). Therefore, we developed a diploid-assisted scaffolding method (named as DipHiC) to scaffold the genomes of polyploid Echinochloa species (Fig. 1a; See details at Supplementary Note 2). DipHiC includes two steps, subgenome distinguishing and chromosome building. To assign contigs to the three subgenomes of E. colona, we integrated the genetic relationship to diploid species, allelic contig information, and inter-contig interactions via multiple rounds of clustering and correction (Supplementary Fig. 2). Consequently, 97.1% of contig sequences were assigned into the three subgenomes, which were designated DH, EH, and FH (AH, BH, and CH have been designated for the three subgenomes of E. crus-galli, with 'H' referring to hexaploid) (Supplementary Note 2). In each subgenome, the directional interactions and chromosome pre-assignment with the diploid reference (E. haploclada) were utilized to construct linkages among contigs. After correction and ordering, we finally assembled the genome of E. colona with subgenome sizes of 436.4 (DH), 310.5 (EH), and 347.1 Mb (FH) (Fig. 1b; Table 1; Supplementary Fig. 1b).\nFig. 1: Assemblies of reference genomes and speciation of the Echinochloa genus.\n\nQuestion: What is the estimated genome size of E. colona var. frumentacea (PI463783)?

{"text": "A yeast two-hybrid assay was performed to confirm the relationship between GmSNF1 and GmPKS4. GmSNF1 has a transcriptional activation domain, and GmPKS4 has a DNA-binding structural domain. The two proteins interact to form a complete transcriptional activator and activate the chromogenic marker. The results showed that co-colonies of GmSNF1 and GmPKS4 showed blue color, and GmSNF1 and GmPKS4 proteins interacted with each other (Figure 1). To further verify that the GmSNF1 protein and GmPKS4 protein interact with each other, a BiFC method based on the transient expression in Benthamite tobacco leaves was used. The results showed that intense yellow fluorescence in tobacco leaves co-transformed with pXY104-GmSNF1 and pXY106-GmPKS4, but not in the control, further confirming the interaction between GmSNF1 and GmPKS4 (Figure 2).\n2.2. Expression Analysis of the GmSNF1 Gene under Abiotic Stresses\nA quantitative RT-PCR was used to investigate the GmSNF1 expression patterns under abiotic stresses in harvested soybean leaf and root samples (Figure 3, Supplemental Figure S1). The seedlings of soybean were treated with NaCl (salt stress), NaCl + NaHCO3 (salt-alkali stress), PEG 8000 (drought stress), or ABA (abscisic acid). The results showed that the expression of the GmSNF1 gene was significantly upregulated under all four abiotic stresses, more significantly in roots than in leaves (Figure 3). In soybean roots, GmSNF1 expression was highest at 12 h of salt-alkali stress treatment and then gradually decreased (Figure 3A), whereas GmSNF1 expression was highest at 6 h of salt stress treatment in soybean leaves (Figure 3B). These results suggested that GmSNF1 influenced responses to abiotic stresses, especially the salt and salt-alkali stresses.\n2.3. Subcellular Localization Analysis of the GmSNF1 Protein\nThe pGDG-GmSNF1-GFP plant expression vector was constructed by inserting the full-length GmSNF1 cDNA sequence, without a stop codon, into the pGDG-GFP vector. The pGDG-GmSNF1-GFP recombinant plasmid and empty pGDG-GFP vector (control) were infiltrated into young leaves of 4-week-old Benthamite tobacco plants. The signal of GmSNF1-GFP accumulated mainly in the nucleus and potentially in the cytoplasm, as revealed by green fluorescence. The results indicated that GmSNF1 was mainly localized in the nucleus and cytoplasm (Figure 4).\n2.4.

{"text": "[Tex/LaTex] Color cell in table\nbackgroundscolortablestabularx\nI'm trying to fill out cells in several rows of my table, however, the color is not filling the entire cell. I can't explain myself why. Additionally, I want my table to be textwidth but it's not executed somehow. Maybe someone could help me understand what I'm doing wrong.\nBest Answer\nYou're mixing and (mis)matching two visual metaphors in one table: (a) color, to highlight various cells (and even an entire column) and (b) the well-spaced horizontal lines of the booktabs package. Use one or the other metaphor, but not both. In the following screenshot, I show what may be achieved by using just color (or, should I say, scales of gray?).\nI can't discern a compelling reason for using a tabularx environment here; in the code below, I use a tabular environment. If you believe the columns ought to be a bit wider, try adding the instruction \\setlength{\\tabcolsep}{12pt}. (The default is 6pt.)\nA brief explanation on how to use the code\nFor each cell that will receive the shading you need to do the following:\nUse \\multicolumn{<number of columns>}{<format specification>}{<text>} specifying the second argument in the form\n!{\\tikzmark{<name1>}} <format> !{tikzmark{<name2>}}\nwhere <name1> and <name2> can be quite arbitrary strings not previously used; I suggest using something like start<number>, end<number>, but you can use any other strings (valid for naming nodes in TikZ). If you need to add vertical rules to the cell, you must use \\vrule inside !{...}; for example, to have vertical rules on both sides of the cell you can say\n!{\\vrule\\tikzmark{<name1>}} <format> !{\\vrule\\tikzmark{<name2>}}\nUse the \\ShadeCell command in the following way:\n\\ShadeCell{<name1>}{<name2>}{<shade specification>}\nwhere <name1> and <name2> are the strings you used in the previous step, and <shade specification> is a valid shade according to TikZ syntax. If the contents of the cell spans more than one line (when using a p{<length>} columns, for example), then you can use the optional argument of \\ShadeCell with the proper value to make the shade cover the cell vertically; for example; if the text of the cell spans 5 lines then you need to use something like\n\\ShadeCell[4]{<name1>}{<name2>}{<shade specification>}\n(The optional argument is the number n-1, where n is the number of lines that the text spans).\n\nQuestion: How many arguments does the \\ShadeCell command take? Answer: The \\ShadeCell command takes three arguments.\n\nQuestion: What should be used instead of \\multicolumn for shading cells? Answer: The \\multicolumn command should be replaced with \\ShadeCell for shading cells.\n\nQuestion: What is the solution provided for the table not being textwidth?

{"text": "Researchers from the Human Sensing Laboratory at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) have published a paper on DensePose from WiFi, an AI model which can detect the pose of multiple humans in a room using only the signals from WiFi transmitters. In experiments on real-world data, the algorithm achieves an average precision of 87.2 at the 50% IOU threshold.\nBecause WiFi signals are one-dimensional, most of the previous methods for detecting people using WiFi can only locate a person's center of mass, and usually can detect only one person. The CMU technique incorporates amplitude and phase data from three WiFi signals captured by three different receivers. This produces a 3x3 feature map which can be passed to a neural network that produces UV maps of human body surfaces, which can localize multiple people as well as determining their poses. According to the researchers,\nThe performance of our work is still limited by the public training data in the field of WiFi-based perception, especially under different layouts. In future work, we also plan to collect multi-layout data and extend our work to predict 3D human body shapes from WiFi signals. We believe that the advanced capability of dense perception could empower the WiFi device as a privacy-friendly, illumination-invariant, and cheap human sensor compared to RGB cameras and Lidars.\nThe process begins by collecting five Channel-state-information (CSI) samples, which are the \"the ratio between the transmitted signal wave and the received signal wave.\" Each sample contains 30 frequencies, and is taken from signals sent from each of three transmitters to three receivers; the result is two raw-data tensors of shape 150 x 3 x 3, one for phase and one for amplitude. This is converted by \"modality translation network\" into a 1280 x 720 image tensor. This is then processed as if it were an image captured by a camera, using the state-of-the-art pose detection network DensePose.\nThe model was evaluated on a dataset of WiFi signals paired with video recordings of scenes containing from one to five people. The scenes were recorded in offices and classrooms. Although there are no annotations of the video to give ground truth for the evaluation, the researchers applied pretrained DensePose models to the videos to create pseudo ground truth. Overall, the model could \"effectively detect the approximate locations of human bounding boxes\" and the pose of torsos, but struggled with detecting limbs.\nIf [WiFi sensing] can detect breathing of humans reliably, then it solves a huge problem in having home automation with automatic lighting - particularly in bathrooms. I've never had a decent bathroom occupancy sensor (they all end up wanting to detect fairly large motions) - the obvious solution is AI with a camera but for obvious reasons no, but if a couple of base stations can localize person positions to rooms in the house (and provide other services) then that kind of solves the whole issue!\nAlthough the CMU researchers have not released their code or model, the Papers with Code website links to GitHub repositories for three other similar projects.\n\nQuestion: What is the size of the image tensor after the modality translation network processes the raw data? Answer: 1280 x 720\n\nQuestion: What is the main limitation of previous WiFi-based human detection methods? Answer: They can only locate a person's center of mass and usually detect only one person\n\nQuestion: What is the shape of the raw-data tensors for both phase and amplitude after collecting the CSI samples?

{"text": "Diabetes is linked to diseases of the exocrine pancreas, such as pancreatitis, which may disrupt the global architecture or physiology of the pancreas, often resulting in both exocrine and endocrine dysfunction. Up to half of individuals with diabetes may have some degree of impaired exocrine pancreas function (269). People with diabetes are at an approximately twofold higher risk of developing acute pancreatitis (270).\nConversely, prediabetes and/or diabetes has been found to develop in approximately one-third of individuals after an episode of acute pancreatitis (271); thus, the relationship is likely bidirectional. Postpancreatitis diabetes may include either new-onset disease or previously unrecognized diabetes (272). Studies of individuals treated with incretin-based therapies for diabetes have also reported that pancreatitis may occur more frequently with these medications, but results have been mixed and causality has not been established (273–275).\nIslet autotransplantation should be considered for individuals requiring total pancreatectomy for medically refractory chronic pancreatitis to prevent postsurgical diabetes. Approximately one-third of individuals undergoing total pancreatectomy with islet autotransplantation are insulin free 1 year postoperatively, and observational studies from different centers have demonstrated islet graft function up to a decade after the surgery in some individuals (276–280). Both person with diabetes and disease factors should be carefully considered when deciding the indications and timing of this surgery. Surgeries should be performed in skilled facilities that have demonstrated expertise in islet autotransplantation.\nPeriodontal Disease\nPeriodontal disease is more severe, and may be more prevalent, in people with diabetes than in those without and has been associated with higher A1C levels (281–283). Longitudinal studies suggest that people with periodontal disease have higher rates of incident diabetes. Current evidence suggests that periodontal disease adversely affects diabetes outcomes, although evidence for treatment benefits remains controversial (284,285).

{"text": "The Success Story of Startup Bombas Socks\nChances are, you've already heard of Bombas socks. You have probably seen commercials for the company at least a few times. They're the ones that talk about fixing all of the things that are wrong with most socks that are produced today, not to mention the fact that they donate a pair of socks to a homeless shelter for every pair they sell. If you're wondering how you can find out more information about this company, you're in luck. All you need to do is keep reading, as this article details how the company came into existence and why it is so successful today.\nIt's important to note that the company has only been in business for a few years, getting its start in 2013. In just five years, they managed to do more business than most companies do in twice that long and they've created a true name for themselves that goes above and beyond what you might expect of any company, especially one whose goal is to manufacture and sell socks. There are a couple of different reasons why they've done so well over the years. For starters, the company did a great deal of research about everything associated with socks long before they ever launched the corporation. As a matter of fact, they spent no less than two full years researching virtually every aspect of their product and they did it with so much obsession that they were able to find new and innovative ways to fix common issues. This will be discussed in more detail in the following paragraph, so for now, suffice it to say that they created a superior product. They also gained a lot of notoriety because they do spend a lot of time donating socks to homeless shelters. They did their research there, too. This has propelled them to something of a celebrity status and it allows them to continue to do good, something that you don't see from most other sock manufacturers. That fact alone makes it more likely that some people are going to do business with Bombas socks, because they know that they're actually helping someone in need when they purchase a pair.\nAs far as conducting research goes, they started out asking around homeless shelters in order to find out what type of need was the greatest. This is how they got the idea to make socks in the first place. They found out that socks were requested more often than any other item in homeless shelters across the country so they decided to set out on a mission in order to create a superior product, using the sale of that product to fund charitable donations. They also did plenty of research about the product itself. If you've ever had a sock that constantly slides down toward the base of your heel or even makes its way halfway off your foot, you know how frustrating it can be, not to mention uncomfortable. By the same token, most people have experienced a time when the seam of the sock gets in just the right spot to drive you nuts until you can stop, take off your shoe, and do something about it. In a worst-case scenario, these problems can cause blisters that become excruciatingly painful, especially if you're doing a lot of walking. Bombas identified the problems and then set about finding a way to fix each and every one of them.\n\nQuestion: What can cause the seam of a sock to become uncomfortable, according to the text? Answer: The seam of the sock getting in just the right spot\n\nQuestion: What is the primary item requested in homeless shelters, according to Bombas' research?

{"text": "Understanding DMV Form 262: Purpose Unveiled\nDMV Form 262 is a document that serves a specific purpose in the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) procedures. This form is designed to be used in situations where a vehicle owner wants to transfer or release liability for a vehicle that they no longer own or operate. The main purpose of Form 262 is to officially notify the DMV of this transfer or release of liability.\nWhen completing Form 262, the vehicle owner is required to provide important details such as the vehicle identification number (VIN), the date of transfer or release, and the new owner's information. This form is crucial for both the previous owner and the new owner, as it ensures that the DMV records are updated accordingly and that any potential liabilities associated with the vehicle are properly addressed.\nBy submitting Form 262, the previous owner is essentially notifying the DMV that they are no longer responsible for any future issues, such as parking tickets or accidents, related to the vehicle. On the other hand, the new owner assumes the responsibility for any such matters from the date of transfer or release.\nIt is important to note that Form 262 should be submitted to the DMV promptly after the transfer or release of the vehicle. Failure to do so may result in the previous owner being held responsible for any future infractions or incidents involving the vehicle.\nReg 262 vs 227: Understanding the Key Differences\nReg 262 and Reg 227 are two regulations that have key differences. Here are the main points to understand:\n1. Scope: Reg 262 focuses on X, while Reg 227 deals with Y.\n2. Reporting requirements: Under Reg 262, companies must submit reports in a specific format, while Reg 227 requires a different reporting format.\n3. Thresholds: Reg 262 has different thresholds for reporting compared to Reg 227. These thresholds determine when a company needs to submit a report.\n4. Compliance deadlines: The deadlines for complying with Reg 262 and Reg 227 are not the same. Companies need to be aware of the specific deadlines for each regulation.\n5. Penalties: Non-compliance with Reg 262 and Reg 227 can result in different penalties. It is important for companies to understand the consequences of failing to comply with each regulation.\n6. Recordkeeping requirements: Reg 262 and Reg 227 may have different requirements when it comes to recordkeeping. Companies should be familiar with the specific recordkeeping obligations for each regulation.\n7. Enforcement: Reg 262 and Reg 227 may be enforced by different regulatory bodies or agencies. Companies should be aware of which entity is responsible for enforcing each regulation.\nIt is crucial for businesses to thoroughly understand the key differences between Reg 262 and Reg 227 in order to ensure compliance and avoid any potential penalties or legal issues.\nUnderstanding Reg 256 DMV: A Guide to Vehicle Registration\n\nQuestion: What are the thresholds for reporting under Reg 262?

{"text": "The government is entirely able to afford to invest in measures to improve living standards in the UK. While higher interest rates make government borrowing more expensive, they do not make it impossible. Recent sales of two-year bonds, intended to raise £4bn, received over £11bn worth of offers, showing there is demand for more borrowing. The real choice is whether the government thinks this spending is worth the higher cost — their current actions suggest a resounding no.\nGovernment interest rates have risen in recent months but in historical terms they are quite low. While journalists and politicians sensationalise high borrowing costs, the cash value of these naturally rise with GDP growth and inflation. Therefore, looking at borrowing costs adjusted for inflation (real borrowing costs) is more insightful.\nInstead of focusing on the cash cost of borrowing we should consider the economic cost instead – not how much money needs to be paid later on but how much purchasing power the money has as it is paid back. The real borrowing costs can fall even when cash borrowing costs are rising due to rising inflation. Looking at borrowing costs from this perspective shows that, even with recent increases, borrowing costs are still below the pre-financial crisis average when borrowing helped fund Sure Start and reduced NHS waiting times.\nFirstly, the government could save up to £100bn in the next 5 years by not funding the Bank of England's interest payments to commercial banks. A tiered reserve system would mean less interest paid to commercial banks to conduct monetary policy or a deferred asset system — like in place at the US Federal Reserve – would mean the treasury wouldn't have to fund the central bank's losses.\n\nQuestion: Are current real borrowing costs below the pre-financial crisis average?

It's not as complicated as it might look, and knowing\nhow to do it can save you from those estimated energy bills that could be too\nhigh or too low.\nWhy Read Your Meter\nYour energy supplier relies on regular readings from your gas and electricity\nmeters to calculate your bills accurately. If you don't provide these\nreadings, they'll have to make an estimate based on your past usage, which\ncan lead to billing errors. To ensure your bills reflect your actual energy\nconsumption, it's essential to read your meters.\nHow to Submit Your Meter Readings?\nYou have a few options when it comes to submitting your meter readings to\nyour energy supplier:\nCall Your Supplier: You can call your supplier and give them the\nreadings over the phone.\nOnline or App: Many energy suppliers offer online portals or mobile\napps where you can submit your readings easily.\nEquipment: High-energy equipment may require dedicated meters.\nIn-Person: Some suppliers have physical locations known as Pay Points\nor Payzone where you can go to submit your readings.\nSmart Meters - The Easiest Option\nSmart meters are a game-changer when it comes to meter readings. They work\ndifferently from standard meters because they can automatically send\nreadings to your supplier. No more manual readings are needed. Plus, you'll\nusually get a handy device called an 'in-home display,' which shows how much\nyou're spending on your energy in real-time.\nElectricity Meter Types and How to Read Them\nElectricity meters come in different types, and understanding yours is\ncrucial for accurate readings.\nSingle-Rate Digital Meter:\nFor a Single-Rate Digital Meter, identify a digital display\nfeaturing 5 numbers in black or white, potentially followed by\none or more red numbers. To read the meter, simply record the\ninitial 5 numbers from left to right while disregarding any\nadditional numbers.\nTwo-Rate Digital Meter:\nFor a Two-Rate Digital Meter, distinguishable by its two rows of\nnumbers, the top row (designated as 'low' or 'night') indicates\nthe consumption of cheaper electricity, while the bottom row\n(labelled 'normal' or 'day') reflects the usage of\nstandard-price electricity. To interpret the meter reading,\nexamine both rows and note down the numbers from left to right,\ndisregarding any figures displayed in red.\nTwo-Rate Single Display Meter:\nFor a Two-Rate Single Display Meter, certain models feature a\nsingle digital display that alternates between rate readings or\nprovides a button to cycle through the rates. Look for a label\nspecifying which rate is 'low' or 'night' and which is 'high' or\n'normal.' When reading the meter, note down the displayed\nnumbers from left to right for each reading.

In making \"the poor and the rich reciprocally dependent\", only a universal franchise recognises the \"action and reaction of self-interest\" as a \"constant and universal\" principle of public welfare.[45]\nWhen United Irish leadership still at liberty sought to muster their members in arms in May and June 1798, Drennan continued in Dublin, the heavily garrisoned capital in which no rebel demonstration proved possible. But while \"the authorities did not molest him in any way in the run-up or aftermath of the 1798 Rebellion\",[46] this was not at the price of Drennan retiring his pen. The \"Marcus letters\", published in Dublin in 1797–8, include the appeal to women,.[23] accused Fitzwilliam's successor, John Pratt, 1st Marquess Camden, of bringing to the people of Ireland only massacre, rape, desolation and terror.[24] In January 1799 Drennan published an open letter to the British Prime MinisterWilliam Pitt assailing his proposals to abolish the Kingdom of Ireland and to incorporate the country with England under the Crown at Westminster. If Ireland was to face \"the cruel alternative of uniting forever with England, or separate forever\", then \"in the name of God and nature\" it should \"separate\".[47]\nDrennan was taken by surprise in Dublin by Robert Emmet's aborted attempt to renew the insurrection in July 1803. What, before the extensive nature of the planning and preparation was known, appeared to have been little more than a bloody street brawl, struck Drennan as a \"mad business\". But he remained loyal to Emmet's family, attending old Mrs Emmet who was to die then days before a sentence of death was passed on her son, and helping his sister Mary Anne Holmes whose husband was detained. With his own sister, Martha, Drennan shared disgust at the subscription made by Dr. James MacDonnell in Belfast to the reward for the capture of Emmet's confederate, their mutual friend Thomas Russell. In a poem sketched for Martha, Epigraph-on the Living (October 1803), Drennan decries \"a man who could subscribe To hang that friend at Last Whom future history will describe The Brutus of Belfast.\"[48]\n\nQuestion: What is the title of the poem Drennan wrote for his sister Martha after Robert Emmet's failed insurrection? Answer: The title of the poem Drennan wrote for his sister Martha is \"Epigraph-on the Living\".\n\nQuestion: What was Drennan's initial reaction to Robert Emmet's attempted insurrection in 1803? Answer: Drennan initially thought Emmet's attempt was a \"mad business\".", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "f4addf3a-0f27-41ef-a0f4-9188be3362c7", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Drennan"}

{"text": "Financial incentives and cost coverage also pose pressing questions, as, in compliance with European regulations, LEZs are poised to completely ban new diesel vehicles in the future, while allowing Euro 6 vehicles entry until 2028, and Euro 5 until 2027. This transformative shift will undoubtedly impact businesses of all sizes, emphasizing the need for strategic decisions and thoughtful consideration of alternative vehicle options in the ever-changing landscape of urban mobility. Indeed, industry trends foresee a potential surge in Euro 5 vehicle purchases in 2024, preceding an impending luxury tax by 2025, rendering diesel vehicles more expensive. As the future unfolds, navigating these zones and their regulations will become pivotal for businesses and individuals alike, heralding a transformative era in urban mobility and environmental stewardship.\nSee the trends and projections of low emission zones in Europe below, published by Clean Cities Campaign 2022:\nSo what do fleet managers need to do about this?\nFor fleet managers navigating the ever-evolving landscape of LEZs, strategic planning is paramount to ensure seamless operations. With three crucial steps, they can stay ahead of the curve and avert any disruptions in the management of last-mile delivery:\n1. Assess the operational footprint: understand when and where the risk of disruption may arise.\n2. Evaluate upcoming product offerings: keep a keen eye on planned vehicle unveils until 2027 for all last mile delivery options. Considering factors like payload capacity, range, and charging speed for at least two models per segment. Additionally, understand early adopters who can switch to suitable options through a comprehensive driver assessment.\nBy proactively embracing these steps, fleet managers can steer their operations towards a greener and more efficient future while navigating the challenges presented by evolving low-emission regulations.\nWhat happens next\nIn the ever-evolving world of corporate urban mobility, navigating last mile and mid-mile logistics presents formidable challenges. Striking the right strategy while considering the time required for charging infrastructure deployment becomes a crucial puzzle to solve. It's clear that businesses must adapt comprehensively instead of contorting to fit new legislation. e-LCVs and light electric freight vehicles emerge as viable solutions for urban mobility, yet smaller players in the lower mid segment often lack the resources for expert consultancy, necessitating accessible guidance during the transition. Subscription-based models tailored for last-mile deliveries stand as a potential remedy. Advocating a measured approach, telematics implementation proves valuable before diving into full electrification. As a plethora of solutions cater to fleet managers, readiness to electrify becomes a pivotal consideration. Ultimately, a comprehensive re-evaluation of needs will steer the course towards a sustainable and efficient future in the realm of urban mobility.\nPublished at January 23, 2024\nJanuary 23, 2024\n\nQuestion: Will new diesel vehicles be allowed in Low Emission Zones (LEZs) after 2028?

{"text": "Can a VPN Help Override Self-Exclusion?\nToday's Internet world provides endless opportunities for communication, access to information, and entertainment. However, within this digital landscape, there is a phenomenon called \"self-exclusion\". This is an action where users deliberately limit their access to certain web resources or social platforms, often for a variety of reasons, including the need to increase productivity, protect themselves from attention, or even to meet ethical standards.\nOne area where self-exclusion can be particularly relevant is the world of gambling, and poker in particular. Many players are looking for ways to bypass Gamstop restrictions and access so-called non Gamstop poker platforms. But what if there was a technological way to remove these restrictions and regain access to blocked online resources? This is where virtual private network (VPN) technology comes into the picture.\nHow a VPN Can Help You Cancel Self-Exclusion?\nIn the previous sections, we have looked at the essence of self-exclusion on the Internet and how a virtual private network (VPN) works.

This wave of success attracted the attention of global VFX powerhouses, with industry giants like ILM Mumbai and Pi Square Technologies making significant investments in the country, while existing players expanded their footprint.\nFueling this growth is the industry's ability to deliver creative marvels, harnessing the power of cutting-edge technological advancements. Amidst the buzz surrounding these advancements, artificial intelligence (AI) has become a focal point, sparking both excitement and apprehension within the industry.\nThe advent of AI initially raised concerns, evoking fears of potential job losses. However, the industry has swiftly shifted its perspective, viewing AI not as a threat but as a powerful tool to be seamlessly integrated into the VFX pipeline. The primary objective is to leverage AI to achieve unparalleled speed and provide artists with the tools to satiate their creative hunger with enhanced precision.\nAs the Indian VFX studios embark on this transformative journey, the industry finds itself at the early stages of exploring AI applications.

{"text": "South America\nCocido Madrileño: The Stew That Has Sustained Madrid for 600 Years\nCocido Madrileño is an unbelievably substantial pottage of chickpeas, sausages, and sturdy vegetables unique to Madrid. It's as emblematic of the Spanish capital as the Prado Museum or the Retiro Park, and is so much more than just a stew.\nCocido Madrileño is one of those regional dishes shrouded in mysticism. It has the power to bring friends and family together, and cure everything from colds to hangovers. Its myth has been furthered by Spanish poets and playwrights throughout history, including the great Lope de Vega. Its legend lives on, gently simmered in award-winning restaurants and grandmothers' kitchens.\nIt sounds deceptively simple: chickpeas, meat and fideos (a thin, short pasta noodle) are slow-cooked in a broth sturdy enough to cut through the most unforgiving of winter days. Traditionally, it's then divided and served in three parts or, as Madrilenians call them, vuelcos; broth, chickpeas and vegetables, then the meat.\n\"It is a lot of food. After a good cocido, most people need a siesta,\" warns María Paz Moreno, author of Madrid: A Culinary History. The writer goes on to explain how, in 17th-century Madrid, \"you could show your social status depending on the amount of meat you could afford to have in your cocido.\"\nBecome a Culture Tripper!\nSign up to our newsletter to save up to 500$ on our unique trips.\nThat's not to say the dish was only for the rich. It transcended class boundaries, appealing to royals and peasants alike; a rather surprising fact, considering how fraught with political turmoil its humble origins are. It's thought cocido Madrileño comes from a Jewish lamb and vegetable stew called adafina, which was eaten on Shabbat. \"During the 15th century, Jewish people living in what is now Spain were forced by the Catholic Kings, Ferdinand and Isabella, to convert to Christianity in order to stay in the country,\" Moreno says. \"If they didn't convert, they could be brought to the infamous Inquisition, or be expelled from the Iberian Peninsula. To show that they had, in fact, converted, they would add pork meat to their stew.\"\nOver the centuries, adafina blended elements from other local stews and incorporated new ingredients. \"Potatoes, which are now always part of the dish, and pimentón (paprika), also often added, came from the Americas and are later additions,\" says Moreno. It would be fair to say, then, that cocido Madrileño was shaped by the different cultures that settled in the Iberian Peninsula, just like the capital itself.\n\nQuestion: Is Cocido Madrileño a dish unique to Madrid? Answer: Yes\n\nQuestion: How is Cocido Madrileño traditionally served? Answer: In three parts or 'vuelcos': broth, chickpeas and vegetables, then the meat\n\nQuestion: Which ingredients were added to Cocido Madrileño later?

{"text": "Design your garden layout with easy access and maintenance in mind. Create pathways or walkways that allow you to navigate the garden comfortably and reach all areas easily. Consider leaving enough space between plantings for weeding, watering, and general maintenance tasks. By designing for easy access, you can ensure that your urban garden remains enjoyable and manageable in the long term.\nIncorporate native aesthetics\nWhen planning your garden layout, aim to incorporate native aesthetics that blend harmoniously with the surrounding environment. Use indigenous plants that are commonly found in your region to create a sense of place and celebrate the local flora. Consider integrating natural elements such as rocks, logs, or water features that mimic the local landscape. By incorporating native aesthetics, you can create a unique and visually appealing urban garden that showcases the beauty of indigenous plants.\nPlanting Techniques\nPrepare planting holes\nBefore planting your indigenous plants, prepare the planting holes to ensure optimal growing conditions. Dig each hole slightly wider and deeper than the root ball of the plant. Loosen the soil at the bottom of the hole to encourage root penetration. If the soil is heavy or compacted, add organic matter to improve soil structure and drainage. Properly preparing the planting holes sets the stage for successful plant establishment.\nSpace plants appropriately\nWhen planting indigenous plants, it's important to space them appropriately to allow for proper growth and airflow. Consider the mature size of each plant and provide enough space for it to reach its full potential. Crowding plants can lead to competition for resources and increased susceptibility to pests and diseases. Leave enough room between plants to ensure adequate air circulation and to maintain the health and vitality of each plant.\nWater thoroughly\nAfter planting your indigenous plants, water them thoroughly to help establish their root systems. Provide enough water to penetrate the root zone and encourage deep root growth. This will help the plants establish a strong foundation and become more resilient to drought conditions in the future. Monitor soil moisture levels regularly and adjust watering accordingly to ensure the plants receive the appropriate amount of water.\nMulch around plants\nMulching around your indigenous plants offers several benefits. It helps conserve moisture by reducing evaporation, suppresses weed growth, and regulates soil temperature. Use organic mulch such as wood chips, straw, or shredded leaves, and apply it around the base of each plant, leaving a small space around the stem to prevent rot. A layer of mulch not only enhances the appearance of your urban garden but also contributes to the overall health and vigor of your indigenous plants.\nMaintaining Indigenous Plants\nMonitor for pests and diseases\nRegular monitoring for pests and diseases is crucial in maintaining the health of your indigenous plants. Inspect your plants for any signs of insect damage, such as holes in leaves or discolored foliage. Be on the lookout for symptoms of diseases, such as wilting or unusual spots on leaves. If you identify any issues, take prompt action to address them, using environmentally friendly methods whenever possible to minimize harm to beneficial insects and wildlife.\nManage watering needs\n\nQuestion: How can you incorporate native aesthetics into your garden layout? Answer: Use indigenous plants, integrate natural elements like rocks or water features, and blend the design harmoniously with the surrounding environment.\n\nQuestion: Should you plant indigenous plants too close to each other? Answer: No, you should not. Crowding plants can lead to competition for resources and increased susceptibility to pests and diseases.\n\nQuestion: What should you do if you find signs of pests or diseases on your indigenous plants? Answer: Take prompt action to address them, using environmentally friendly methods whenever possible.", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "8fd0c71d-d719-473c-9b6b-374dff41ef80", "url": "https://balconybloomer.com/using-indigenous-plants-in-urban-gardening-projects/"}
{"text": "Resources\n4 QFocus Ideas to Use in Math\nField(s): Teaching + Learning\nType: Right Question Insights\nSubject(s): Math\nFinding Question Focus prompts to use for a QFT in English or social studies might seem on the surface to be easier than finding them for math. Many teachers pull an interesting quote from a book, use an essay prompt, or share a curious primary source. However, there are many creative and engaging prompts you can craft from your curriculum to spark questions and promote math learning.\nEarlier this year, as part of the National Council for Math Teachers (NCTM) virtual conference, RQI staff member Katy Connolly and high school math teacher Tracy Brown teamed up to present a short, pre-recorded workshop about using the QFT to bring curiosity and joy to math learning. Selecting examples of how the QFT has been applied in math classrooms in preparation for this conference inspired us to think more deeply about what goes into designing a math Question Focus, or QFocus.\nHere are four ideas for creating your own math QFocus prompt, inspired by examples from math teachers that we pulled out of the archives.\nIdea 1: Combine mathematical elements with non-mathematical elements\nTeachers have shown time and again that the QFT can work well in math. In fact, one of the very first QFT examples we often share with teachers is a math example. Deirdre Brotherson, a fourth-grade teacher in Hooksett, New Hampshire, used the following prompt at the start of a unit on variables, the goal being to understand what the students did and didn't already know about the topic:\n🙂+ 🙂+ 🙂= 24\nBrotherson received a range of responses from students, everything from, \"What do the smiley faces mean?\" to, \"Can we replace each smiley face with an 8?\" and, \"Do the numbers have to be the same because the smiley faces are the same?\" While some students clearly approached the topic with more prior knowledge than others, all students were able to engage in some way with the prompt.\nWhat worked about this QFocus is that it combined the familiar with the unfamiliar. It used something students recognized (a smiley face symbol) with a concept they didn't yet understand — variables, or by definition, \"symbols that represent a mathematical object.\" Teachers often attest that new math concepts can be daunting for some students, especially if they are concerned that their lack of background or inability to pick something up \"quickly\" sets them behind other students. The fear of looking unknowledgeable in front of peers can prevent students from speaking up or participating at all.\nIn this lesson, for students who had never worked with variables, the smiley faces in the prompt gave them something to anchor on to. For those who already knew how variables worked, the unsolved equation gave them a window to start speculating about solutions.\n\nQuestion: What was the benefit of using smiley faces in the first QFocus? Answer: The smiley faces in the first QFocus gave students something familiar to anchor on to, making it easier for them to engage with the prompt, especially those who had never worked with variables before.\n\nQuestion: What is the goal of the first math QFocus example mentioned in the text? Answer: The goal of the first math QFocus example is to understand what students already know about variables.\n\nQuestion: What was one of the student's responses to the first QFocus? Answer: \"What do the smiley faces mean?\"", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "6d6daddd-7fdf-43b5-b2d7-111a01aefc1f", "url": "https://rightquestion.org/resources/4-qfocus-ideas-to-use-in-math/"}
{"text": "Practical approaches for outstanding technical provision\n5th October 2017\nOver the last year there has been a lot said about the introduction of T Levels. Since the publication of the Sainsbury Review and the Post-16 Skills Plan the Association of Colleges (AoC) has been working with the Department of Education to get to grips with what they actually are and what they mean to students.\nDespite the rhetoric, there are still a lot of questions: Who are the T Levels for? What does the transition year incorporate and who can access it? How will the work placements be managed? How does all of this fit in with other 16-19 pathways that the majority of the age cohort will access?\nOne of the most important questions is how can the sector prepare itself for the implementation. Since March, AoC has been managing a project, in partnership with emfec and commissioned by the Education and Training Foundation. This has seen a £1.2 million fund available for 21 college and provider-led projects across the country. Each of these has been trialling and testing practical solutions for developing outstanding teaching, learning and assessment for all students on the future technical routes.\nDerby College, for example, is leading a project which explores how a problem-based learning curriculum can be used to develop the behaviours, skills and knowledge of engineering students in line with the requirements of the prospective T Levels. Employer partners play a central role in the development of these problems, adding to their authenticity.\nIn another project, Reaseheath College is expanding the use of the 'lean management' approach in their agricultural curriculum and implementing it on the college farm. Students are working with employers to plan a project to improve farm efficiency and using lean management to monitor and measure the impact of the changes.\nEach of the projects involved have made great strides in understanding effective ways for implementing T Levels. The lessons learnt will be finalised and shared widely across the sector, including at AoC's Annual Conference and Exhibition on 14-15 November in Birmingham. This will showcase two projects; one led by Lakes College with a focus on the nuclear sector, and the other led by South Devon College with a focus on hair and beauty.\nThe introduction of T Levels is an unknown for the sector. This programme has helped to establish how colleges and providers can embrace the new approach. Most importantly, Students and employers will benefit from better teaching, learning and assessment.\nDavid Corke is the Director of Policy for the Association of Colleges\nWe are also organising a final conference on the programme in March 2018.\n\nQuestion: Who is responsible for the introduction of T Levels? Answer: The Department of Education\n\nQuestion: Which college is leading a project that explores problem-based learning for engineering students?

{"text": "The Cezve—alternatively known as ibrik, briki or Turkish coffee pot —is a diminutive, elongated-handled pot crafted from copper or brass, which first made its appearance in the Ottoman Empire. (1) This time-honored brewing technique wielded a formidable impact on the nascent Polish coffee culture and continues to be favored by a sect of ardent coffee aficionados to this day. To conjure up coffee using the venerable cezve, a blend of finely ground coffee beans, sugar, and water is amalgamated, resulting in a lavish and full-bodied concoction.\nThe amalgam is gently heated over a flickering, low flame, permitting the coffee grounds to descend and nestle at the pot's base. As the liquid reaches boiling point, it spawns a dense foam that is meticulously decanted into petite demitasse cups, with the sediment left undisturbed. The outcome is a profoundly aromatic, marginally acrid coffee that encapsulates the essence of the Turkish sway on Poland's coffee culture.\nThe Time-Honored Polish Approach: The Venerable Kawiarka\nThe kawiarka, an emblematic Polish coffee maker, is a cherished household artifact passed down through the annals of familial history. Drawing inspiration from the Italian moka pot, the kawiarka comprises two vertically aligned chambers demarcated by a filter. The bottom chamber is designated for water, while the top chamber cradles the ground coffee.\nTo conjure up coffee using the kawiarka, water within the lower chamber is heated until steam is birthed. The ensuing pressure compels the water to traverse the coffee grounds and ascend into the upper chamber, culminating in a robust, full-bodied brew. The final elixir is smoother and less acerbic compared to its cezve counterpart, rendering it a favored selection for daily coffee consumption among the Polish populace.\nThe Contemporary Flair: Drip Coffee\nAs Poland's coffee culture undergoes metamorphosis and embraces contemporary inclinations, drip coffee has carved a niche among the younger demographic and specialty coffee aficionados. This brewing technique entails the cascading of hot water over medium-coarse coffee grounds nestled within a paper or metal filter. The water leisurely permeates the grounds, extracting the essence and fragrances of the coffee before trickling into a carafe or mug.\nDrip coffee affords enhanced control over brewing parameters, such as water temperature, steeping duration, and coffee-to-water proportion, culminating in a more uniform and harmonious cup. The burgeoning popularity of drip coffee in Poland bears testimony to the nation's receptiveness to innovation and its quest to discover novel methods of relishing its treasured beverage while revering its ancestral foundations.\nHow to Pronounce Various Coffee Terms in Poland\nWhen exploring the coffee culture in Poland, it's important to familiarize yourself with the pronunciation of various coffee terms. Here is a list of common coffee-related phrases and their Polish pronunciation:\nBy learning the pronunciation of these coffee terms, you'll be better equipped to communicate about coffee in Poland and appreciate the rich coffee culture the country has to offer.\nDelving into Distinctive Polish Coffee Concoctions\n\nQuestion: What is the Polish coffee maker called that is inspired by the Italian moka pot?

{"text": "Firstly, the current account deficit affects the balance of payments, which is a record of all economic transactions between a country and the rest of the world. The deficit is reflected as a negative value in the current account section of the balance of payments, indicating that the country is spending more on imports than it is earning from exports. This deficit can lead to a decrease in the country's foreign exchange reserves, which can have implications for its currency stability and overall economic health.\nSecondly, the current account deficit affects the income statement of a country. It represents a net outflow of income from the country to foreign entities. This outflow includes payments for imports, interest payments on foreign debt, and dividends and profits repatriated by foreign investors. These outflows reduce the country's net income and can have a negative impact on its overall economic performance.\nLastly, the current account deficit affects the national income accounts of a country. It reduces the country's gross domestic product (GDP) by the amount of the deficit. This reduction in GDP can indicate a decrease in economic activity and can have implications for employment levels, investment, and overall economic growth.\nAnalyzing the Current Account Deficit\nWhen analyzing the current account deficit, it is important to consider both the structural and cyclical factors that contribute to its formation. The current account deficit is a measure of a country's net trade balance, including both goods and services, as well as income and transfer payments with the rest of the world.\nOne way to analyze the current account deficit is by examining the composition of its components. For example, a large deficit in the trade balance, which measures the difference between a country's exports and imports of goods, can indicate a lack of competitiveness in the domestic economy. This could be due to factors such as high production costs, lack of innovation, or an overvalued currency.\nAnother factor to consider when analyzing the current account deficit is the balance of payments. This includes not only the trade balance, but also the balance of services, income, and transfers. A deficit in any of these components can contribute to an overall current account deficit. For example, a deficit in the balance of services could indicate a lack of competitiveness in the service sector, while a deficit in the balance of income could indicate a high level of foreign ownership of domestic assets.\nIn addition to the composition of the current account deficit, it is also important to consider the underlying structural and cyclical factors that contribute to its formation. Structural factors refer to long-term trends and characteristics of the economy, such as demographics, technological advancements, and institutional factors. Cyclical factors, on the other hand, refer to short-term fluctuations in economic activity, such as business cycles and exchange rate movements.\nStrategies for Managing the Current Account Deficit\nManaging a current account deficit requires a comprehensive approach that addresses both structural and cyclical factors. Here are some strategies that can be implemented to effectively manage the current account deficit:\n1. Promoting Export-Led Growth:\n\nQuestion: Which strategy can be implemented to promote export-led growth and help manage a current account deficit? Answer: Promoting Export-Led Growth\n\nQuestion: Which economic indicator does a current account deficit directly reduce? Answer: Gross domestic product (GDP)\n\nQuestion: What does a current account deficit indicate about a country's spending on imports compared to its earnings from exports? Answer: It indicates that the country is spending more on imports than it is earning from exports.", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "44a89dc8-9821-4588-92b1-e48c8528392a", "url": "https://saxafund.org/current-account-deficit-causes-understanding/"}
{"text": "And this is where the tension occurs: older generations accepted the curtain and we assumed the next generation would naturally do the same. It can seem entitled from our lens when they want explanations. On some level, we expect them to do as we did, accepting those in charge had the right to make the policies and trusting that things were the way they were for a reason.\nAssumptions are made here on the part of younger people as well, specifically, that assumption that their unlimited access to information and explanation should extend into the workplace as well and that, as part of the organization, they should have access to the information they want and need. Perhaps the greatest assumption that is often made is that, just like Google, everyone will be happy to provide information when asked. I've had multiple experiences of assuming my students or my younger colleagues understand that the way they are approaching me or a workplace situation is a deviation from the way it's typically been done, only to learn that they are assuming people have always operated by the same norms they use.\nAdjust the Lens\nNext, we must Adjust our Lens (Gentelligence Practice #2). This is where we focus on understanding the generational perspective that seems counter to our own (be curious, not judgmental).\nOlder generations who put themselves in the shoes of their younger colleagues are likely to better understand that a sudden lack of information and explanation after a lifetime of unlimited answers would be concerning and surprising, almost like being asked to navigate a new place without GPS. From this lens, it makes sense they would be searching for explanations, questioning why things are a certain way, and feel relatively lost when explanations are not clear.\nYounger employees also need to Adjust the Lens, but this can be more difficult. In my work, I've found that often the youngest generation in the workplace is unaware that their norms differ from those who entered the workforce before them. (This becomes apparent soon enough, but usually through unfortunate communications such as \"In my day, we never questioned policy!\"). Helping our younger colleagues adjust the lens might require a bit of conversation (\"It's interesting you asked why we do performance evaluations that way. When I was at your career stage, I would have never been bold enough to ask, so I am surprised when you do\").\nThe key to this practice is remembering that neither norm is right or wrong; they're just different. Once we know our assumptions and think about how our younger (or older) colleagues see the situation, we can move away from frustration and toward a more productive conversation.\nStrengthen Trust\nLast fall, I wrote a piece for Fast Company on performance reviews after multiple managers called me with the same concern: their usual way of giving constructive feedback was falling flat with their youngest employees, leading to disengagement and even turnover. While feedback was being delivered as it always had been, the reaction to it had changed.\nMy advice was to pull back the curtain.\n\nQuestion: What is the third and final section of the text titled?

{"text": "In a collaborative effort between the government of Ethiopia and the international humanitarian community, a comprehensive Humanitarian Response Plan (HRP) has been launched to address the escalating crisis in the country. The plan, issued in February 2024, aims to provide urgent assistance and protection to crisis-affected populations across Ethiopia.\nThe HRP highlights the pressing challenges faced by the nation, including the impact of climate change and ongoing conflicts, which have resulted in a multitude of humanitarian needs. Ethiopia's vulnerability to climate change has been evident for decades, with weather shocks causing significant harm to the most vulnerable communities. After consecutive failed rainy seasons since late 2020, the prolonged drought in southern and southeastern Ethiopia has been particularly devastating. However, the recent belg rains have brought temporary relief by replenishing water sources and rejuvenating pastures.\nFurthermore, the intensifying El Niño-driven drought in northern Ethiopia has compounded the situation, affecting communities already grappling with food insecurity. While partners had temporarily halted food assistance due to aid diversion incidents, the government, private sector, and local communities have come together to provide life-saving support. However, sustained assistance is crucial as recovery efforts continue in the coming years. Additionally, the projected belg season flooding poses another challenge that needs to be addressed proactively to mitigate its impact in 2024.\nThe HRP outlines strategic response priorities that encompass various sectors, including agriculture, education, health, nutrition, protection, and water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH). It emphasizes the importance of operational capacity, access to affected areas, and measures to protect vulnerable populations from sexual exploitation and abuse.\nThe plan also emphasizes the need for strong coordination and collaboration among stakeholders. It acknowledges the vital role of donors and humanitarian agencies in supporting Ethiopia's response efforts and expresses gratitude for their continued partnership. With the requirement of over US$3 billion in funding for this year alone, the government and its partners are calling for enhanced solidarity to address the growing needs and avert the risk of a humanitarian disaster.\nThe Humanitarian Response Plan for Ethiopia serves as a crucial tool to guide the allocation of resources and ensure a well-coordinated and effective response. It is a testament to Ethiopia's commitment to working in partnership with the international community to assist those in dire need.\nAs the crisis in Ethiopia continues to evolve, the success of the HRP will hinge on early action and sustained support from donors.

{"text": "A suite for big band, Afro-Cuban percussion and vocals: Pianist and composer Jesus \"Chucho\" Valdés tells the story of The Creation according to Regla de Ocha, the Afro-Cuban religion known as Santería.\nChucho Valdés made his early mark in Cuban music's history as founder, leader, main composer and arranger of the group Irakere, revolutionizing Latin Jazz with its fusion of rock, jazz and Afro-Cuban music in the 1970s. He had begun his professional career in the orchestra of his father, the pianist and arranger Bebo Valdés.\n\"La Creación represents the accumulation of all my experiences and everything I've learned in music,\" says Valdés, who celebrated his 80th birthday in 2021. If Irakere indicated a turn in his musical quest, leaving large ensembles behind, La Creación represents a return to big-band sonorities – but \"with the experience of the road traveled,\" says Valdés who is winner of six Grammy and three Latin Grammy Awards.\nThematically, in La Creación, Valdés delves into concerns he has explored in works such as Irakere's La Misa Negra (1987), an early milestone in his career, and Canto a Dios (2011), a more recent composition in which he fused jazz with symphonic music. The beliefs of the Catholic religion and the Regla de Ocha have coexisted in Cuba for centuries.

{"text": "\"The President: Part of the challenge is--and I see this in our politics--is a common conversation. It's not so much, I think, that people don't read at all; it's that everybody is reading [in] their niche, and so often, at least in the media, they're reading stuff that reinforces their existing point of view. And so you don't have that phenomenon of here's a set of great books that everybody is familiar with and everybody is talking about. Sometimes you get some TV shows that fill that void, but increasingly now, that's splintered, too, so other than the Super Bowl, we don't have a lot of common reference points. And you can argue that that's part of the reason why our politics has gotten so polarized, is that--when I was growing up, if the president spoke to the country, there were three stations and every city had its own newspaper and they were going to cover that story. And that would last for a couple of weeks, people talking about what the president had talked about. Today, my poor press team, they're tweeting every two minutes because some new thing has happened, which then puts a premium on the sensational and the most outrageous or a conflict as a way of getting attention and breaking through the noise--which then creates, I believe, a pessimism about the country because all those quiet, sturdy voices that we were talking about at the beginning, they're not heard. It's not interesting to hear a story about some good people in some quiet place that did something sensible and figured out how to get along.\n\"Robinson: I think that in our earlier history--the Gettysburg Address or something--there was the conscious sense that democracy was an achievement. It was not simply the most efficient modern system or something. It was something that people collectively made and they understood that they held it together by valuing it. I think that in earlier periods--which is not to say one we will never return to--the president himself was this sort of symbolic achievement of democracy. And there was the human respect that I was talking about before, [that] compounds itself in the respect for the personified achievement of a democratic culture. Which is a hard thing--not many people can pull that together, you know.... So I do think that one of the things that we have to realize and talk about is that we cannot take it for granted. It's a made thing that we make continuously.\"\nThe common sense that we cannot take for granted and that we must continuously make is a central theme of Hannah Arendt's understanding of political action. Action is new, surprising, and shocking. It is the spontaneous surprise of action that gathers people around and initiates the conversations, dialogue, and discourses that gather a plural and diverse group of individuals into a political people. The worry Arendt voices is that in an era of spectacle and statistics, surprising action is rare and easily dismissed as an aberration. Action can be either criminal or heroic. To surprise and shock, action must become ever more extreme, which leads to it increasingly being seen as criminal, or at least irrelevant. The result is the splintering of attention and the loss of a common focus.\n\nQuestion: According to the President, what type of stories are not interesting to hear in today's media? Answer: Stories about good people in quiet places doing sensible things and getting along.\n\nQuestion: What is one of the worries Hannah Arendt voices about political action in an era of spectacle and statistics?

Thanks (Also a friend recommended me the lumix g7 idk about thay)\nI would avoid the M-series line as it would be a dead end. Do check out Canon's R-series which is the future. There is a wide range of price points from the EOS R100 all the way up to the EOS R3. The EOS R100 being the smallest and least expensive (though also the least amout of bells and whistles).\nTo offer you gear advice it would be helpful to know some details about your situation: 1. What is your budget - by which I mean a number value. We need to make suggestions that you can afford. 2. What subjects do you want to take photos of? That helps us decide what lenses you might want to use. 3. What do you want to produce? i.e. social media, digital display, small-medium prints or very large, detailed ones. That has a major impact on the investment you need to make. 4. What are you prepared to carry? Do you need small and compact, or something larger? 5. Do you have any further constraints: e.g. eyesight, injuries, need to travel so want very small/light etc.\nBased on what you have indicated so far, I would not recommend either the M6 versions you mention. As Rick wisely said the M-series are living on borrowed time, but further to that, the M6 bodies do not have a built-in Electronic Viewfinder and although you can add an external one, at some expense, it is not an effective solution. Why do you need an EVF? It's about stability.\nIf you want to shoots sports, you need a long telephoto lens unless you can guarantee you are really close to the participants - such as table tennis. When using a telephoto lens, how you hold the camera is critical and that become more so the longer the lens. Holding it like a cellphone, which is how one normally would use the M6, is not a stable platform. You need three points of contact to your body (like a tripod) to steady the camera, as per the enclosed images. To make that possible you need to be able to bring the camera to your eye, and that demands a viewfinder. The M6 was designed for social work, street etc., where one is likely to use wide-angle (short focal length ) lenses. There are much, much better cameras out there for wildlife work\n\nQuestion: What is the main reason the assistant does not recommend the Canon M6 versions? Answer: They do not have a built-in Electronic Viewfinder (EVF), which is crucial for stability when using telephoto lenses for sports photography.\n\nQuestion: What type of photography was the Canon M6 designed for? Answer: Social work and street photography, where wide-angle lenses are typically used.\n\nQuestion: Which camera models are mentioned in the text?

{"text": "Electricity in Montserrat in 2021\nBased on the data provided, Montserrat's current electricity consumption is significantly below the global average of 410 watts per person. The island country primarily relies on fossil fuels for its energy supply, which contributes to climate change through greenhouse gas emissions. Additionally, the small scale of the electricity generation results in less reliable service, which can negatively influence the local economy and quality of life.\nSuggestions\nTo increase its low-carbon electricity generation, Montserrat could draw inspiration from various countries. For instance, Spain and Brazil have successfully harnessed wind power, generating 61 TWh and 94 TWh respectively. These countries have similar climates to Montserrat, indicating potential for wind energy on the island. Additionally, Montserrat could learn from countries like Japan, which generated a substantial 99 TWh from solar energy. Given Montserrat's tropical climate, solar power could be a feasible and efficient energy source. As solar and wind technologies continue to advance, they possess a viable, low-carbon solution for Montserrat's electricity needs.\nHistory\nData on Montserrat's historical low-carbon electricity generation was not provided, thus it is not possible to accurately describe the history of low-carbon electricity in Montserrat.

Host small business appreciation events: Show small businesses how much they are valued by the community with an appreciation event in their honor. Ask the community to nominate a small business that does amazing things for your area such as sponsoring sports teams, hosting food drives, etc. This not only rewards the business that is supporting the community but shows others how much the business does.

{"text": "Passing a Dictionary to a Custom Operator in Apache Airflow\nIntroduction to the Topic\nIn this comprehensive guide, we will delve into the process of passing a dictionary to a custom operator in Apache Airflow. As you navigate through the world of Airflow, there comes a time when the standard operators fall short, and you need to customize your workflow. This customization often involves passing intricate data structures like dictionaries between tasks.\nWhat You Will Learn\nBy following this tutorial, you will learn how to create a custom operator and effectively pass a dictionary as an argument. This knowledge is crucial for developing advanced workflows that demand dynamic inputs and intricate data handling.\nUnderstanding the Problem and Solution\nThe challenge lies in ensuring that our custom operator not only accepts a dictionary as input but also utilizes it efficiently within its execution logic. The solution entails defining our custom operator to inherit from Airflow's BaseOperator while implementing additional handling for dictionary-type arguments.\nExplanation\nSubsequently, we define MyCustomOperator, where:\n– The __init__ method is defined to accept my_dict as an argument alongside any other args or kwargs.\n– Within the execute method, the dictionary is iterated over to log each key-value pair. This showcases how you can access and utilize your passed data within your task's logic effectively.\nThis example illustrates how dynamic inputs can be seamlessly integrated into your workflows, enhancing their versatility across various scenarios requiring more than static configurations.\nHow do I pass multiple dictionaries to my custom operator?\nYou can modify the constructor (__init__) method signature of your custom operator to accept multiple dictionaries by specifying additional parameters.\nCan I use Jinja templating with my dictionaries?\nYes! Ensure your template fields are correctly defined in your custom operator class. You can then reference variables using Jinja syntax within those dictionaries if needed.\nIs there any limitation on what kind of data my dictionary can hold?\nNot particularly; however, remember that complex objects may need special consideration if they aren't serializable or if they don't play well with Jinja templating (when used).\nHow do I make sure my passed-in dictionary doesn't affect concurrency or parallelism negatively?\nOperational considerations like concurrency depend more on overall DAG design rather than individual task inputs. However ensuring minimal side effects during execution and avoiding global state changes are good practices.\nWhat happens if I pass an empty dictionary?\nYour custom operator should be designed robustly enough to handle such cases gracefully�either by skipping certain operations or providing defaults where applicable.\nConclusion\nMastering the art of creating and utilizing customized operators significantly elevates one�s ability to orchestrate complex workflows using Apache Airflow efficiently. By understanding techniques such as passing dynamic structures like dictionaries between tasks, you gain endless possibilities for tailoring automation pipelines precisely according to specific needs at hand.\n\nQuestion: How can you ensure that passing a dictionary to a custom operator doesn't negatively affect concurrency or parallelism? Answer: Ensure minimal side effects during execution and avoid global state changes, as these are good practices for maintaining concurrency and parallelism.", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "dc46315e-f75a-4abc-8bd7-8db4fac9fe4d", "url": "https://pythonhelpdesk.com/2024/02/25/passing-a-dictionary-to-a-custom-operator-in-apache-airflow/"}

{"text": "Brontë Sisters Facts & Worksheets\nBrontë Sisters and education\nTeaching career\nLiterary career and later years\nKey Facts And Information\nLet's find out more about the Brontë Sisters!\nBorn in the early 19th century in Thornton, Yorkshire, the Brontë sisters were the daughters of Maria Branwell and Patrick Brontë. They all initially started working as teachers or governesses for a few years before embarking on their literary careers. Their first published work was a self-financed collaborative book of poems under male pseudonyms, which they continued to use in their individual published works. Between them, the Brontë sisters published seven novels in 1847-1857, which were contemporaneously successful and have become classics.\nPortrait of Anne, Emily and Charlotte by Branwell Brontë, c.1834\nEarly years and education\nThe Brontë Sisters were the daughters of Maria Branwell and Patrick Brontë. Charlotte was born on 21 April 1816, Emily on 30 July 1818 and Anne on 17 January 1820 all in Thornton, Yorkshire. Their mother, who came from a middle-class family, unfortunately died in 1821, when the sisters were all still very young. Their father, who came from a family of farm workers, was an Anglican clergyman who was appointed as perpetual curate of the village of Haworth, on the Yorkshire moors.\nFollowing Maria Branwell's death in 1821, her unmarried elder sister Elizabeth Branwell moved to the residence of the Brontë family to assist Patrick in looking after the young children.\nThe family had only arrived in Haworth in April 1820 and therefore had no relatives or acquaintances of long-standing to turn to for assistance with the young children.\nThe children called her Aunt Branwell, and she was the one who taught the girls arithmetic, the alphabet, and how to sew, embroider and cross-stitch, skills which were expected of ladies.\nIn 1824, the four sisters, Maria, Elizabeth, Charlotte and Emily, were enrolled in the Clergy Daughters' School at Cowan Bridge, which mainly accommodated the education of children of middle-class clergy. They were among the youngest of the boarders and were accepted as one of the Charity children.\nHistory, geography, grammar, writing, arithmetic, needlework and \"the nicer kinds of household work\" were to be taught at the Clergy Daughters' School. French, drawing and music were also part of the syllabus as extras.\nIn 1825, the two eldest girls developed an advanced case of tuberculosis in the aftermath of a typhoid outbreak and were consequently withdrawn from the school.\nUpon seeing the state of his two daughters, Patrick immediately removed Charlotte and Emily from the school and brought them back to Haworth.\nMaria and Elizabeth did not survive and died in May and June of that year, respectively. The death of the two eldest sisters impacted the surviving sisters, especially Charlotte.\n\nQuestion: Which two subjects were not part of the core curriculum at the Clergy Daughters' School?

{"text": "Are Air Fried Chicken Wings Bad for You?\nAir fryers have become an incredibly popular kitchen appliance in recent years. Using rapid air circulation technology, air fryers can produce crispy, delicious foods like fried chicken wings, but with significantly less oil. This leads many people to believe that air fried chicken wings are a healthier alternative to their deep fried counterparts. But how healthy is air fried chicken really?\nAre Air Fried Chicken Wings Bad for You?\nAir fried chicken wings are not inherently unhealthy or \"bad\" for you in moderation. Compared to deep fried wings, air fried wings are lower in calories, fat, and contain fewer carcinogenic compounds thanks to using little to no oil. However, air fried wings can still be relatively high in fat, sodium, and cholesterol compared to other protein options.\nSome specific pros and cons to consider:\nPROS:\n70-80% less fat and 50-70% fewer calories than deep fried wings. The rapid air circulation mimics deep frying with much less oil.\nMore B vitamins and other nutrients are preserved since the wings are not submerged in hot oil.\nCONS:\nWings have a high baseline fat content, so even air fried they can be high in saturated fat and cholesterol.\nSeasonings and sauces often make wings high in sodium.\nThe high air fryer temperatures (400°F+) can potentially create compounds that are unhealthy if consumed regularly.\nRegular or excessive intake of wings may lead to weight gain and other issues.\nOverall, enjoying air fried wings in moderation as part of a balanced diet is fine for most people. Be mindful of portion sizes, frequency, and what seasonings are used to keep wings as healthy as possible. Those with specific cholesterol or sodium-related conditions may need to be more cautious with air fried wings. But for most, the reduced fat and carcinogens make air fried wings a better choice than deep fried.\nHow Healthy is Air Fried Chicken?\nThere are several key benefits that make air fryer chicken wings a better choice than deep frying:\nLess fat and calories – Air frying slashes fat by up to 70-80% and calories by 50-70% compared to deep frying the same wings. The rapid air flow surrounds the wings to crisp the skin without needing to submerge them in oil.\nRetains moisture – The hot circulated air cooks the wings very fast. This seals in juiciness and prevents the drying out effect of low-moisture oven baking. Air fryer wings come out tender and moist on the inside.\nFewer carcinogens – High heat oil can generate compounds like acrylamide and heterocyclic amines which may be carcinogenic. Air fryers dramatically lower exposure to these cancer-linked compounds. Studies show air fried foods have acrylamide levels 4-5 times lower than deep fried foods.\nMore nutrients preserved – Vitamins and minerals are degraded less in an air fryer because there is less direct oil contact and lower heat exposure. For example, air frying preserves more B vitamins compared to deep frying. This maintains more nutritional value.\n\nQuestion: Are air fried chicken wings completely free of fat and calories? Answer: No, they are not. Air fried chicken wings still contain fat and calories, just fewer than their deep fried counterparts.\n\nQuestion: How much less fat and calories do air fried chicken wings have compared to deep fried ones? Answer: Air fried wings have 70-80% less fat and 50-70% fewer calories than deep fried wings.", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "8da81d37-cbcf-4665-a2dc-713e8b6e816d", "url": "https://askcaraa.com/are-air-fried-chicken-wings-bad-for-you/"}

{"text": "Wooden, upholstered, and outdoor furniture are some of the most valuable items you can flip for profit. However, some of these items might require a bit of work to get the most out of them. Wooden furniture can be re-finished and upholstered furniture can be cleaned or reupholstered. None of these tasks are extremely demanding, but they can result in a nice profit.\n🛌 There are numerous websites and platforms for selling used furniture, but some are simply better than others. Here are the best places to sell used furniture online and locally.\n20. Motorized Items\nDirt bikes, ATVs, snowmobiles, jet skis, golf carts, and other motorized items are great for flipping because many people who aren't using them will sell them for a low price just to get rid of them.\nA great thing about motorized items is that you can always upgrade certain parts, resulting in an even better flip. Nonetheless, flipping motorized vehicles will require a decent starting capital.\nHow Flipping Works\nNow that we've looked at the 20 best items for flipping, let's look at how flipping works. The idea is to purchase items at a low price and sell them at a higher price to earn profit.\nThe essential steps of flipping are:\nStep 1: Know Your Market\nThe key to making flipping profitable is a keen sense of what items are worth in the resale market. If you spot an item in a garage sale, you need to know how much you'll have to put into it and what you can expect to sell it for.\nFlipping works best when you're buying and selling items that you know about and care about. That's also a big part of what makes flipping fun!\nStep 2: Buy\nEvery flipping process starts with investing in an item you wish to flip. Whether you're searching for big tech pieces or antique jewelry, your choices are endless. However, make sure the product is worth more so you don't end up wasting your money. To find the products for flipping, try visiting yard sales, vintage stores, flea markets, and anywhere else that sell items at low prices.\nStep 3: Fix (If Necessary)\nIf you've bought a broken item or an item that could benefit from a makeover, now would be the perfect time to do that. Fixing broken items or giving them a completely new look can drive up the value dramatically and increase your profit.\nStep 4: List\nOnce you purchased an item and possibly made it more valuable, you can list it. Most flippers use popular digital marketplaces to sell their products because it allows them to reach a larger audience. Some go-to marketplaces include eBay, Amazon, Craigslist, OfferUp, and Facebook Marketplace.\nStep 5: Sell\nThe only thing left to do is sell your product. Naturally, the more money you sell your items for, the better. Nevertheless, that doesn't mean you should hold onto your items for a long time just because you believe they might be worth slightly more. It's all about balance.\n\nQuestion: What are some ways to sell used furniture online?

The autophagy probe fluoresces red when inserted in the lipid membranes of autophagosomes and autolysosomes. Results can be read using a flow cytometer.\nFigure 1. The process of autophagy is an intracellular degradation process during which cytosolic organelles and materials are enclosed within an isolation membrane to form an autophagosome. The outer membrane of the autophagosome fuses with the lysosome. The sequestered material is subsequently degraded within the autolysosome.\nSKU: 9156\nAutophagy is a conserved lysosomal recycling process by which cells break down their own components such as proteins, lipids, and carbohydrates. Autophagy plays a critical role in maintaining homeostasis by preventing the accumulation of damaged organelles by disassembling unnecessary or dysfunctional cells and cellular components. Autophagy occurs at low levels in the cell under normal conditions and can be rapidly upregulated during times of starvation or stress. Such degradation activities serve to provide nutrients (amino acids, nucleotides, fatty acids, etc.) and energy during periods of elevated bioenergetic demands. Another function of autophagy is to assist with the detection and destruction of intracellular pathogens (viruses, bacteria, and parasites). Dysregulation of autophagy has been associated with many disease states including cancer, infection, and degenerative diseases.\nAutophagy is a dynamic process typically divided into three stages (Figure 1). During stage one, cytoplasmic components targeted for degradation are sequestered within a double-membrane phagophore (also called the isolation membrane). This results in the formation of double-membrane vesicle called the autophagosome. During stage two, the autophagosome fuses with the lysosome to form the autophagolysosome or autolysosome. Degradation of the autophagosomal contents occurs during stage three.\nOur Autophagy Probe - Red Fluorescent enables researchers to detect and monitor the in vitro development of autophagy in living cells. Autophagy Probe - Red Fluorescent is a cell-permeant aliphatic molecule that fluoresces brightly when inserted in the lipid membranes of autophagosomes and autolysosomes.

I'm smarter than him, faster than him. Shit, I probably got more money than he do. Definitely more handsome than he is. So I'mma figure something out. 'Cause, it don't matter how long it takes, or how many times it takes. One way or another, I'm gettin' home to my f***ing dog.\"\nReview:\nTwo Distant Strangers is a remarkable piece of work that does plenty to tackle the issue of the paranoia Black America endures before law enforcement. In fact, this 30-minute short film does more than many lengthy films or documentaries - it's that good in its compact presentation.\nTDS has the obvious looping plot that begs the question - why do they keep killing us? And, how do we make it stop? Intelligently woven throughout the film is the debunked theory that the two sides just need to hear the other side as the structure overrides the understanding of the two sides. We see this after both Carter and the officer have a discussion in the car, have a civilised conversation on various life topics, just to see him die in the alleyway. The film leaves you with the lesson that this structure allows the brutality of black bodies not because of a lack of willingness to understand, but because well, that's just how the cycle is replayed - or, the country's structure functions.\nI especially love the humanization of Carter - he was in love, and just wanted to get home to his dog. It's another piece we lose the reality of in many of these cases that go public.\nBesides the awesome plot and execution of messaging, some major props must be given to Joey Bada$$ who played the role of Carter so well. Working as his counterpart, Andrew Howard stole the show as the grizzled NYPD officer. Their performances were strong and added to the beauty that is this film.\nI understand TDS may not hit everyone the same - political affiliations included - but, I do think that's also part of why this film is necessary to view...and kind of speaks to the message of the film.\nI highly recommend TDS. It won an Oscar, carries a great message, and gives you ALOT to think about in thirty minutes. Load it up on Netflix as soon as you can\n\nQuestion: In which year was the film released?

{"text": "Blog\nThe Art and Science of Dental Restorations: Navigating Material Choices in the Modern Dental Lab\nThe world of dental restorations has witnessed remarkable advancements with the advent of three-dimensional printing and computer-aided design and manufacturing (CAD/CAM) technology. However, traditional porcelain-fused-to-metal (PFM) restorations continue to hold their ground in modern dental laboratories. In this blog post, we will explore the unique benefits of PFM restorations, the role of dental lab technicians in blending artistry and technical expertise, and the various dental lab material options available, including dental alloy, zirconia block, porcelain powder, and glaze and paste kits.\nThe Enduring Appeal of PFM Restorations\nPFM restorations offer unique advantages that make them a valuable option for specific cases, even in the era of CAD/CAM technology. They can provide a more natural appearance and enhanced durability, particularly in situations where the surrounding teeth are heavily stained or discolored. Complex cases with multiple components, such as bridges with multiple pontics or extensive reconstructions, may be better suited for traditional PFM restorations due to the limitations of CAD/CAM technology.\nThe Role of Dental Lab Technicians: Blending Artistry and Technical Expertise\nDental lab technicians play a crucial role in creating restorations that blend seamlessly with the surrounding teeth. Aesthetic considerations, such as color matching and shading, are vital in this process. A deep understanding of dental anatomy and tooth morphology is also necessary to create restorations that are both functional and visually appealing. By combining artistry and technical skill, dental lab technicians can create restorations that exceed the expectations of patients and dentists alike.\nDental Lab Material Options\nDental Alloys: Dental alloys are used in the fabrication of PFM crowns, bridges, and other restorations. They offer strength and durability, making them suitable for back teeth restorations and patients with bruxism. Common metals used in dental alloys include gold, nickel, and chromium.\nZirconia Blocks: Zirconia blocks are used in CAD/CAM technology to create zirconia crowns and bridges. Zirconia is a biocompatible, strong, and aesthetic material that offers a metal-free alternative to PFM restorations.\nPorcelain Powder: Porcelain powder is used in the fabrication of all-porcelain restorations, such as veneers and crowns. It offers excellent aesthetics and can be layered to create a natural-looking restoration that blends seamlessly with the surrounding teeth.\nGlaze and Paste Kits: Glaze and paste kits are used to enhance the aesthetics of dental restorations. They can be used to add translucency, adjust the color, and create a smooth, glossy surface that resembles natural tooth enamel.\nComparative Table: PFM Crowns vs. Zirconia Crowns\nProperties/Factors\nPorcelain to metal (PFM) Crowns\nZirconia Crowns\nComposition\nMetal base (e.g., gold, nickel, chromium) with porcelain layer\nZirconium oxide\nStrength & Durability\nHigh\nVery high\nAesthetics\n\nQuestion: Which technology has driven remarkable advancements in the world of dental restorations?

{"text": "The global burden of viral infections remains alarmingly high in terms of mortality and morbidity. Viruses primarily enter the body through mucosal sites inhabited by commensal microbiota. Within these sites, viruses interact with the host microbiota, resulting in alterations to the host's immune responses. The gut microbiota actively intervenes in viral infections to maintain the stability and equilibrium of mucosal sites, thus ensuring its own survival. On the other hand, pathogenic viruses have evolved mechanisms to exploit host microbiota to favor viral spread and immune evasion. Several studies indicate that the gut microbiome serves a dual role as both guardian and facilitator in the context of pathogenic viral infections within the gut. Therefore, it is vital to consider the complex interaction between viruses, microbiota, and immune cells within the host tissue microenvironment to understand how they determine disease outcomes.\nIn this review, we discussed studies that have demonstrated that probiotics and their metabolites possess the ability to decrease the risk of viral infections. Additionally, beneficial bacteria in the gut can act as adversaries against viral infections that disrupt gut homeostasis. We highlighted the role of mucosal γδ T cells as a significant immune cell subpopulation involved in both immune responses to viral infections and the regulation of mucosal tolerance and host microbiota composition. Overall, the gut microbiota is linked to viral infections and pathogenesis, and its modulation has excellent therapeutic potential. Future research endeavors should prioritize establishing the causal relationships between viral infections and gut dysbiosis. Moreover, it is crucial to develop standardized gut microbiota patterns among healthy individuals, considering the influence of key factors such as diet, lifestyle, and genetics on the gut microbiome. Also, determining the optimal routes for microbiome modulatory therapies, such as oral ingestion versus infusion via colonoscopy, in relevant preclinical models (including nonhuman primates) is of utmost importance. Likewise, standardizing screening measures to reduce pathobionts, including latent viruses, Enterobacteriaceae, and enterococci, from fecal samples is imperative for the development of microbiota transplantation as a therapeutic approach for viral disease pathogenesis.\nIn conclusion, the interactions between the gut microbiome and mucosal immune cells, including γδ T cells, have important implications for susceptibility and response to viral infections. Advancing our understanding of the complex mechanisms underlying these interactions is crucial, as it can pave the way for exploring the potential of microbiome modulation therapy as an effective strategy against viral pathogenesis. Further research is needed to delve deeper into these areas and uncover novel approaches to combat viral pathogenesis.\nAuthor Contributions\nWriting—original draft preparation: F.F., S.T. and N.R.; review and editing: K.B., W.-K.K., J.R. and D.A.W.

{"text": "rizki1, 22 Feb 2024they sold more than Asus, Sony, HTC combined.I doubt mi 13 ultra sold more than rog 7 pro or 1v.\nAnyone with more than $800 to buy phone in China chooses huawei or apple.\nNo surprise BBK is getting rid of foldables.\nis this pricing for the Chinese model or the global model? If the Chinese model is priced like this then the global model will be more expensive in most countries than the iPhone 15 Pro Max it seems, just like last year. The price could've gone down due to no HUGE change this year apart from the main cam. The battery uplift is welcome though, last year's Ultra needed more juice for some reason. Very interested in seeing how the main cam performs though, I don't think the difference between other 1 inch sensors (f/1.63 on the Xiaomi vs others with f/1.8) is going to make any huge difference, I do think the larger range of the variable aperture is a very nice addition. Just wish it went up to like f/10 or something since this sensor is massive and at that point no one would need to take close up shots with the UW lens. The range of the change in aperture is still less than Huawei and Huawei uses a smaller sensor so it can take sharper shots, idk man Xiaomi should've had a larger range because this phone is like a super super small update. Should've called it the Xiaomi 13S Ultra.\n\"an outrageous 474% more than the Pro.\"\nThat's related to the \"3.2x\" camera. (1.4/1.0)² * (2.8/1.8)² = 4.74 , so not 474% more, but 474% as much (374% more), if the 3.2x camera uses the full sensor area. As the 15 Pro's tele likely has a slightly smaller field of view, it should be also slightly less than 374% more light from an object per exposure time.\nAlso, and I stress I can't say this for certain, but I assume a lot a the future costs of updates etc can be lower on the Chinese one as there is no google play and Xiaomi's app store is defualt, meaning all ad/app revenue covers a lot for Xiaomi in their domestic market. The same revenue in Europe/US goes straight to Google, hence Xiaomi has to bake in more in the sale amount as they have little to no revenue from the devices after point of sale outside of China.\nIn most countries it is fully possible to import from China, but of course this means you don't get the same local warranty, or possibly even any type of warranty, and you have to pay local VAT most likely which will raise the total quickly.\n\nQuestion: Which companies are the main competitors in the high-end smartphone market in China?

Riyue & Daotang River\nThe mountain was known as Chilling Range in ancient China. Legend has it that in the Tang Dynasty, Emperor Taizong granted Princess Wencheng a mirror named the Sun and the Moon before she married King Songtsen Gampo of Tibet. The mirror was said to see Chang'an, then capital, and her relatives. When she passed through Chilling Range, the princess threw the Sun and the Moon onto the mountain. Hence the name. To commemorate Princess Wencheng, the local people built two pavilions named the Sun and the Moon respectively. At the northwestern foot of the mountain a river runs westward. Hence its name.

Money should be a permanently circulating asset, not a stupid debt owed to bankers and their capital holders.\nThe rules of money and politics are man-made but not always arbitrary.

But the FAA (who developed the system) doesn't lay claim to anything better than 7 meters. WAAS satellites aren't as abundant as GPS satellites. There are two of them serving our part of the world - assuming you live somewhere in the Americas. With one WAAS satellite over the Pacific Ocean and another over the Atlantic Ocean, you may not always receive their signals due to conflicts with the horizon. They are in geostationary orbit so they are always over the same position with respect the earth's surface, and buildings, etc. can get between you and the satellite(s).

{"text": "Tom Standage on his Brief History of Motion\nTom Standage is the author of six history books, including A History of the World in 6 Glasses, The Victorian Internet (a history of telegraphy) and An Edible History of Humanity. His latest book, A Brief History of Motion, charts the rise of personal transportation, from the introduction of the wheel (around 3500 BCE) to the 21st century developments of electric cars, autonomous vehicles and services like Uber.\nIn addition to his book writing, Standage, who lives in London, serves as a deputy editor of The Economist. HNN discussed with Standage his views on technology, the writing of history and the global push to switch to electric vehicles.\nQ. Your previous books, including The Victorian Internet and A History of the World in Six Glasses have focused on new technologies as drivers of societal change. Your histories differ from more traditional historical accounts which place greater emphasis on political change (e.g. a new prime minister or president). Do you think that technological change is undervalued in most traditional histories of European and North American nations?\nYes, I think it is undervalued. My specific interest is the social impact of technology, and how people react to it, so this is a form of social history, with a focus on how the adoption of technology can cause bottom-up change. In that sense it's an antidote of sorts to the top-down, \"great man\" view of history. But there's then the danger of falling into the trap of technological determinism: the notion that technology is the only thing that drives societal change. In my work I try to show the interaction between \"technology push\" and \"societal pull\" — between what new technologies can offer, and what people actually want —because new things only take hold if they meet a genuine need or align with a wider societal shift. So I think you need to consider both the technology, and the prevailing social and political environment, rather than focusing on just one or the other.\nQ. Your new book, A Brief History of Motion, begins with the development of the wheel around 3500 B.C.E and continues through contemporary automobiles. You limit your account to \"personal transportation,\" including the horse, carriages and the rise of the automobile. You ignored sea and air transportation. Why did you narrow your focus?\nI'm mostly interested in the impact of the automobile, and the way it reshaped the world during the 20th century. To understand why the automobile was embraced so rapidly, particularly in the United States, it's important to understand the context in which it appeared, and the earlier development of wheeled vehicles such as carriages, steam trains and bicycles. The car promised to combine their best elements: it offered the speed of a train, but could travel on existing roads like a horse-drawn vehicle, but also granted personal freedom for spontaneous travel, like a bicycle. We can only understand what happened with the car, and what might happen next, if we examine those earlier technologies. Hence my focus on wheeled vehicles, and why I ignored sea and air transportation.\n\nQuestion: What is Tom Standage's occupation apart from being an author? Answer: He serves as a deputy editor of The Economist\n\nQuestion: What is one reason why the automobile was rapidly embraced, particularly in the United States? Answer: It combined the best elements of earlier wheeled vehicles\n\nQuestion: Which of the following is NOT a book written by Tom Standage?

We apply the same quality first approach as we would with beer and seek out the finest producers that align with our core values. Apples are one of the UK's richest culinary treasures and we're proud to show them off through these Ciders.

We've sought out the best in the world to provide a genuine beer experience packed full of flavour and a diverse range of options.\nThe history of the meteoric rise and success of craft beer in the USA is dominated by IPA, a style rebirthed in America borne out of disappointment and boredom with the status quo.

In here you'll find everything from crystal clear West Coast pale ales and bitter Belgian pales through to fruited murky New England style IPAs.\nA Belgian oddity that is tricky to simply define. Essentially a truly refreshing, bone dry beer, typically brewed with wheat and other common European cereals such as Spelt. Usually fermented with an array of yeast strains, including Brettanomyces, and in some cases lactobacillus too. In the past these were produced with whatever ignredients were to hand, something modern brewers have taken as a licence to run free with adjunct additions such as herbs and fruits.\nIn a category dominated by a tiny handful of enormous multinational brands we're fiercely proud to champion independent options. These brands are focused on producing delicious sodas and juices from natural ingredients and expanding the flavours available in the category as a whole.\nA unique speciality of the Pajottenland region surrounding Brussels. An incredibly complex style involving a baffling mash schedule that creates cloudy protein rich wort, boiling with aged hops, and cooling in an open coolship to allow inoculation with wild yeasts and bacteria that will eventually develop complex sour flavours in the beer over years of fermentation.

{"text": "Decoding the Language of Healthcare: A Primer on Billing Terminology\nThe healthcare billing and payment environment relies heavily on complex systems of codes, forms, procedures, and specialized terminology. For patients to fully understand their medical bills, communicate effectively with providers and insurers, and advocate for themselves, it is essential to understand key billing and payment terms, processes and forms they will encounter related to health insurance coverage, medical coding, billing workflows and costs.\nNavigating Health Insurance Terminology\nThere is a good deal of complex health insurance terms used on paperwork and in processes that can confuse or intimidate patients. Learning basic insurance terminology makes policies and communications clearer.\nThe \"premium\" refers to the upfront recurring cost of maintaining health insurance coverage, usually paid monthly. A \"copay\" or copayment is the fixed dollar amount defined in the policy that the patient pays per office visit, prescription or other medical service rendered. \"Coinsurance\" refers to the defined percentage of costs for a service that the patient owes, while the insurer covers the remaining portion.\nThe \"deductible\" is the annual dollar amount in out-of-pocket medical expenses the patient must pay themselves before the health insurance coverage will begin contributing payments toward care. \"Out-of-pocket maximums\" refers to annual limits on the total amount a patient must personally pay in deductibles, copays, and coinsurance before the insurance covers 100% of further care that year. \"In-network\" refers to providers who have contracted negotiated rates with the insurer; staying in-network makes care more affordable.\nDemystifying Medical Coding Terminology\nOn the provider side, they use medical billing codes to numerically describe diagnoses and procedures for standardized documentation and billing. \"ICD-10\" codes are an expansive set of alphanumeric codes used specifically for categorizing and documenting medical diagnoses such as asthma, diabetes, pneumonia, etc. \"CPT codes\" are a set of 5-digit codes developed by the American Medical Association that are used to identify and define specific medical services and procedures rendered by providers, including lab tests, office visits, surgeries, therapies, and thousands more.\nThe experts over at Find-A-Code.com explain that \"modifier codes\" are 2-digit extensions to CPT codes used to add further details helpful for accurate billing such as left/right body part or precise treatment approach. Proper matching of diagnosis codes and procedure codes is crucial – billing using inaccurate or outdated codes will lead to claim denials and delays in provider reimbursement. Clinical documentation in the medical chart must support the codes used for billing purposes.\nUnderstanding the Chargemaster and Pricing\nWithin a hospital or healthcare facility, the \"chargemaster\" is essentially an exhaustive list of retail prices set annually for every service, procedure and supply provided, enabling the facility to generate a patient bill and charge for all items used in treatment. However, partly due to negotiated discounts, very few patients actually end up paying chargemaster prices in full. Insurers usually negotiate significantly lower reimbursement rates than the chargemaster listed prices. Uninsured patients can also negotiate prompt-pay cash discounts from chargemaster prices.\nBreaking Down Your EOB Statements\n\nQuestion: What does the term \"premium\" refer to in health insurance?

The sub is based on sharing memes (yep, it's AdviceAnimals if you hadn't noticed yet), so when we found a post that didn't linked to a meme, the post was inmediatly taken down and flagged as spam (if we caught it, sometimes, the spam gets past of guards).\nAn example of that \"spam that gets past our guards\" happened the same week I got promoted: a random user posted something from a random meme maker (I don't remember its name right now) and used bot accounts to upvote it and get it to the front, where everyone who opened reddit at that time would see it. They'd open it (the link wasn't RES-compatible, so they couldn't open it without clicking) check the meme (a rather lame one, btw) and close it. No harm done, right? They didn't knew it got upvoted by bot accounts, so they made no harm? Wrong. Turns out that account was a pretty new one, with just 2 or 3 submissions from imgur (so it would look like a normal account for the mods) and then submitted the submission from that unknown page.\n\nQuestion: What is the main concern of the user in the first paragraph? Answer: The user is concerned about the influx of immature users on Reddit who do not understand or care about blogspam and the impact it has on the platform.", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "1288c8eb-6cf4-41ee-9137-5bb3a7dfca21", "url": "https://hubski.com/pub/100957"}
{"text": "Australia: Excise on Tobacco and Alcohol\nAustralia has some of the highest excise duties on tobacco and alcohol in the world. These taxes are built into the price of these products, making them more expensive for consumers. The government justifies these taxes as a way to reduce consumption and improve public health, but they also generate substantial revenue.\nManaging the Impact of Stealth Taxes\nAwareness and Education\nOne of the most effective ways to manage the impact of stealth taxes is through awareness and education. Understanding how these taxes work and where they are applied can help individuals make informed financial decisions and advocate for greater transparency.\nBudgeting and Financial Planning\nEffective budgeting and financial planning can mitigate the impact of stealth taxes. By tracking expenses and understanding where your money is going, you can adjust your spending habits to accommodate higher costs and maintain financial stability.\nAdvocacy and Policy Change\nAdvocating for policy changes and greater transparency in taxation can help reduce the burden of stealth taxes. Engaging with policymakers and supporting initiatives that promote tax fairness can lead to more equitable taxation systems.\nThe Future of Stealth Taxes\nDigital Economy and Stealth Taxes\nAs the digital economy grows, new forms of stealth taxes are likely to emerge. For example, digital services taxes on tech giants are becoming more common, and these costs are often passed on to consumers indirectly.\nClimate Change and Environmental Taxes\nGovernments are increasingly implementing environmental taxes to combat climate change. These taxes, such as carbon pricing, can act as stealth taxes by raising the cost of goods and services that rely on carbon-intensive processes.\nConclusion\nStealth taxes are an integral part of modern fiscal policy, often flying under the radarwhile significantly impacting personal finances. By understanding how these taxes work and taking proactive steps to manage their effects, individuals can better navigate the financial landscape. Advocacy for greater transparency and fairer tax policies is also crucial in ensuring that the burden of taxation is distributed equitably.\n\nQuestion: True or False: Stealth taxes are not an integral part of modern fiscal policy.

And it's a super confusing kind of discipline and, you know, brand and branding. It's a relatively young discipline and, and it's really hot right now. And I'll talk about why it's really hot, but it's evolving. And so there's a lot of confusion around these words. And for me, you know, the definition of a brand is not your logo. It's not your corporate identity, it's not your product.\nIt's not even a promise, a lot of people say a brand is a promise. And it's certainly not all the impressions that you make across your company or brand. But really, the definition that I like to go by is that it's, it's a gut feeling that someone has about your products or services. And it's a gut feeling because we are crazy, emotional, intuitive creatures as humans, right, like, we are not logical, we like to think that we're logical, but we're not we're emotional. And it becomes a gut feeling. Because also, as business owners, we have this misconception that we control the brand. And we don't, or customers control the brand, it's created by the customers. And so it's created and owned by the customers, not the company, not our brand teams, not agency, not an agency. Like that's a crazy concept to me to think about.\nEven when I like I sit in this every day. And I think about, like what is a brand, the idea that we work on brands that we don't really control it, we do our best to create a brand we do our best to influence what a brand is, but we don't actually control or own it. And in the truest sense, and why brands even exist is because people use brands to simplify buying choices, you know like we're living in this crazy world. And I'll talk about that a little later, where we just have infinite choice. And so we don't know how to categorize all that information. And brands really exist to help us simplify buying choices. And kind of back to the idea of like a brand isn't what you say it is, but what the outward outside world says it is like one of my favorite quotes of all time is from Jeff Bezos, the richest man in the world. So I, I take him as an authority on this topic. And he's super customer-centric.\n\nQuestion: According to Marc Gutman, what do customers control?

If you struggle with drifting off, know that you're not alone—according to the CDC, nearly 15% of adults in the United States report having trouble falling asleep.\nBut there are techniques you can try that may help. That's why we've gathered some of our favorite sleep techniques that may do the trick and have you drifting off to dreamland in no time.\nThe Dream Team: Quality Sleep and You\nGetting good rest isn't just a luxury we hope for…it's a necessity for a happy life and healthy living.\nA lack of quality sleep can lead to a host of problems, from grumpy mornings to more serious health issues. Studies link poor sleep to increased stress, impaired cognitive function, and even a higher risk of chronic conditions.\nAs we sleep, our bodies work to repair themselves and prepare our brains for the next day's learning. And, while each body is different, experts recommend the average adult shoot for 7 – 9 hours of sleep every night.\nTechniques to Help You Fall Asleep\nIf you struggle to fall asleep at night, try one of the following techniques:\nPillow Breath\nYou'll notice many of the techniques shared here use the power of the breath to help you enter a state of relaxation. If you've never practiced regulating your breath, it can feel…well, weird. But you might be surprised how effective these exercises can be.\nThe Pillow Breath technique is great for both beginners and visual learners:\nLie flat on your back in bed with your knees bent and feet flat on your mattress.\nPlace a small pillow over your stomach.\nAs you inhale, focus on moving the pillow upward.\nWhen you exhale, the pillow should lower. Fully empty your lungs.\nRepeat the process 5 – 10 times. You should feel a reduction in stress and increased relaxation.\nAs you get more comfortable with the routine, you can ditch the pillow and use your hand as a guide.\n4-7-8 Breathing\nThis is a simple yet powerful method championed by Dr. Andrew Weil. Here's how it works:\nInhale quietly through your nose for a count of 4.\nHold your breath for a count of 7.\nExhale completely through your mouth for a count of 8.\nThis type of breath regulation is effective for reducing anxiety, slowing the heart rate and clearing the mind.\nMeditation\nMindfulness meditation is like a lullaby for the soul. Find a quiet spot, sit or lie down comfortably, and focus your attention on your breath. Your thoughts will likely wander, but gently bring your focus back to your breath. Meditation not only helps quiet the mind but also reduces stress and anxiety, paving the way for a restful night.\nIf you're new to meditation, consider using a guided meditation video to help.

{"text": "Since September 2015, when the twin detectors of the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) first recorded gravitational waves—a phenomenon predicted by Albert Einstein (1879–1955)—the number of events observed and associated with this distortion of space-time have literally exploded. Most have involved distant binary systems, located between 130 million and 3 billion light-years away from Earth and composed of two massive celestial bodies—usually a pair of black holes or neutron stars. These bodies orbit around a center of gravity, spiraling progressively closer toward a tremendous collision that results in the production of gravitational waves.\nIn an article published in the scientific journal Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society on June 21, a trio of astrophysicists from the University of São Paulo (USP) and the Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte (UFRN) proposed that gravitational waves could be used to discover and study other binary formations—composed of a star similar to the Sun and a giant exoplanet with an ultra-short orbital period—that are much less energetic and closer to Earth, less than a thousand light-years away. These types of exoplanets have masses greater than Jupiter, the most massive planet in our solar system, and are almost \"glued\" to their star, taking about an hour to complete one full orbit around it. Earth takes about 365 days (which we call a year) to completely orbit the Sun.\n\"Earth-based detectors like LIGO do not have the resolution needed to register the weak gravitational waves emitted by this type of planetary system,\" explains USP's José Ademir Sales de Lima, lead author of the study. \"But we did some calculations and found that the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna [LISA] will be able to measure them in some cases.\" Coordinated by the European Space Agency (ESA), LISA will be the first space observatory dedicated to measuring gravitational waves. It is expected to begin operations in the 2030s. Of the approximately 2,800 known planetary systems, just over a dozen are formed of a star and an ultra-short-period exoplanet.\nLima and his colleagues Francisco Edson da Silva and João Vital da Cunha, both from UFRN, calculated the probable level of gravitational waves emitted by 14 such systems, all with exoplanets that orbit their star in less than 80 minutes. In the end, they concluded that only three of them emit enough gravitational waves to be detected by LISA: GP Com b, V396 Hya b, and J1433 b. These exoplanets have masses 18 to 57 times greater than Jupiter and are located between 245 and 737 light-years from Earth. Because they are extremely close to their star, they are too hot to contain liquid water. \"Like any binary system, every exoplanet orbiting around a star generates gravitational waves. However, the vast majority are very weak, so we are unable to detect them,\" explains Vital.\n\nQuestion: What are the two types of celestial bodies usually involved in these binary systems?

{"text": "Our current geopolitical woes are tied to our dependence on fossil fuels. Green energy is a way out\nOur dependence on fossil fuels must be reduced considerably to ensure a world without conflict\n| Photo Credit:\nRick Wilking\nUnderlying the chaos and conflict of our times — be it war or cataclysmic natural disasters linked to climate change – is the dependence on fossil fuels. Climate change is the consequence of overuse of fossil fuels over centuries. And, the urge to control regions rich in these fossil fuels has been one of the primary drivers of war.\nThese wars have periodically driven economies the world over into a tailspin of inflation and growth paralysis. What we are going through today is not dissimilar to earlier episodes of war, disruption and inflation, over the last 80-100 years; territorial control over resource rich regions has been a driving force all along.\nThe fact is that large quantities of fossil fuels are concentrated in tiny geographical pockets. Hence, the urge to control over regions rich in reserves of coal, oil, and natural gas forms the sum and substance of foreign policy worldwide.\nCountries neighbouring these prized regions, as well as others, play all sorts of games to grab them — deploying religion, language, alliances to that end. Conflicts also suddenly start when there is a temporary change in the balance of power, breaking the earlier, often fragile, equations of peace.\nHistorical overview\nControl over fossil fuels has historically been a reason for some of the biggest wars. The centenary of the occupation of the Ruhr (1923-1925) falls next year. The Ruhr region spreads around the Rhine River, which borders France and Germany. French and Belgian troops occupied the minerally and industrially rich Ruhr region, as Germany had stopped sending coal to France as part of the reparation deal struck during World War I. This occupation led to the crash of the German currency and the economy, which eventually led to the start of World War II.\nAlmost 45 years after the end of World War II, ownership of fossil fuel (petroleum) became the focus of another global conflict when Saddam Hussein invaded neighbouring Kuwait.\nA win over Kuwait would have made Iraq world's leading energy power, dominating both the Arab and the Persian Gulf regions, home to the bulk of the planet's oil reserves. The US and its allies could not have accepted this dramatic shift in balance of power, if Iraq were to win.\nFast forward to the present day conflict involving Russia and Ukraine. The Donbas region has rich coal reserves. The other parts including the Dnieper-Donetsk region, and the Black Sea of Azov are a rich source of natural gas, an important input for manufacturing fertilisers.\n\nQuestion: Which two countries have been involved in a conflict over fossil fuel-rich territories in recent times? Answer: Russia and Ukraine.\n\nQuestion: Which conflict in the 1990s was primarily about controlling oil reserves? Answer: The Gulf War (1990-1991) between Iraq and the US-led coalition.\n\nQuestion: Which region was occupied by French and Belgian troops in 1923 due to Germany's failure to send coal as reparations? Answer: The Ruhr region.", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "3a938272-c09b-439f-9900-353ae35ff610", "url": "https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/opinion/green-energy-for-world-peace/article66108513.ece"}
{"text": "During the Middle Ages, two systems of thought competed for primacy. The rationalist-philosophic school endeavored to present all commandments as serving higher moral and ethical purposes, while the mystical tradition, exemplified in Kabbalah, assigned each rite with a role in hidden dimensions of reality. Sheer obedience, derived from faithfulness to one's community and ancestry, was believed sufficient for the common people, while the educated chose one of the two schools. In the modern era, the prestige of both declined, and \"naive faith\" became popular. At a time when contemplation in matters of belief was associated with secularization, luminaries such as Yisrael Meir Kagan stressed the importance of simple, unsophisticated commitment to the precepts passed down from the Beatified Sages.[clarification needed] This became standard in the ultra-Orthodox world.[35]\nJudaism adheres to monotheism, the belief in one God. The basic tenets of Orthodoxy, drawn from ancient sources like the Talmud and later sages, chiefly include the attributes of God in Judaism: one and indivisible, preceding all creation, which God alone brought into being, eternal, omniscient, omnipotent, absolutely incorporeal, and beyond human reason. This basis is evoked in many foundational texts, and is repeated often in daily prayers, such as in Judaism's creed-like Shema Yisrael: \"Hear, O Israel, the Lord is our God, the Lord is One.\"\nMaimonides delineated this understanding of a personal God in his opening six articles. The six concern God's status as the sole creator, his oneness, his impalpability, that he is first and last, that God alone, and no other being, may be worshipped, and that he is omniscient. The supremacy of the God of Israel is even applied to non-Jews. According to most rabbinic opinions, non-Jews are banned from the worship of other deities. However, they are allowed to \"associate\" lower divine beings with their faith in God (mostly to allow contact with Christians, accepting that they were not idolaters with whom business dealings and the like are forbidden.)\nThe utter imperceptibility of God, considered as beyond human reason and only reachable through what he chooses to reveal, was emphasized among others in the ancient ban on making any image of him. Maimonides and virtually all sages in his time and thereafter stressed that the creator is incorporeal, lacking \"any semblance of a body\". While incorporeality has almost been taken for granted since the Middle Ages, Maimonides and his contemporaries reported that anthropomorphic conceptions of God were quite common in their time.\n\nQuestion: What was the common people's belief regarding obedience to religious commandments?

{"text": "Our analysis of the data found that six of the top 10 most banned books in America dealt with race and two others with gender or sexuality. Experts say that robs students who come from marginalized communities of the chance to see themselves reflected in the books they read.\nWhen Kate Taddeo, a librarian at Expeditionary Learning Middle School in Syracuse, shared Angie Thomas's \"The Hate You Give\" with her students, she said the impact was profound. Taddeo recalls reading the book with her students and asking them what they thought about it.\n\"I had a kid look at me and go, 'she looks like me,'\" Taddeo recalled. \"And that hit harder than any of the other big discussions because it was the first time this kid had seen a book where the person on the cover looked like her.\"\nThe fifth most banned book on PEN America's index, Thomas's young adult novel follows a Black girl grappling with the impact of racism after witnessing her best friend being shot by a police officer. In 2018, the book was challenged by the Fraternal Order of Police in Charleston, South Carolina, after the order's president, John Blackmon, stated that the book was \"almost an indoctrination of distrust of police.\"\nBut for some teachers in Syracuse, the frequently challenged book has been a useful tool in helping students cope with heavy topics.\n\"Our students are aware of what's going on in the world,\" said Jennifer Kailer, a librarian at Van Duyn Elementary School. \"Having some sort of book allows them to not only see themselves but also helps them comprehend and open up these conversations so that they feel seen, that they feel safe, that they feel understood.\"\nMinorities make up only a small fraction of published authors in America. In 2020, The New York Times found that 95% of books published from 1950 to 2018 were written by white authors. Yet nearly half the authors on the Top 10 most banned list are people of color, according to the PEN America data.\nTo understand the rise of book bans, it's important to understand how bans are changing. In the past, book bans tended to result from sporadic, local activism. Now, bans are often the result of state legislation, as well as efforts from national groups like No Left Turn in Education and the ironically named Moms forLiberty. Yet despite the more organized efforts, the bans still rarely go through any sort of formal process.\nIn its data, PEN America defines the \"origin of challenge\" for each ban, which indicates whether the challenge to a book was the result of a formal, written challenge, or was initiated by another means, such as a school administrator acting in response to political or parental pressure. In the majority of states with book bans, the challenges originated from an administrator rather than a formal challenge, the data shows. In Texas, the state with the most bans, only 3.5% of bans originated from formal complaints.\n\nQuestion: How many of the top 10 most banned books dealt with race?

Members of Alpha Platoon's Seal Team 7 alarmed by their leader's conduct said they were initially shut down by military chiefs when they first spoke up, and told their own careers would suffer if they continued to talk about it.\nEventually, the Navy Criminal Investigative Service (NCIS) began an inquiry and the platoon members were called to give evidence.\n\"The guy is freaking evil,\" special operator first class Craig Miller, one of the platoon's most experienced members, told investigators in sometimes tearful testimony. \"I think Eddie was proud of it, and that was, like, part of it for him.\"\nMiller said Gallagher, who had the nickname Blade, went on to stage a bizarre \"re-enlistment ceremony\" over the body of the captive. \"I was listening to it and I was just thinking, like, this is the most disgraceful thing I have ever seen in my life,\" he said.\nAt his court martial, the panel heard evidence that Gallagher had emailed a photograph to a friend in the US containing a photograph of him holding up the dead captive's head with the words: \"Good story behind this, got him with my hunting knife.\"\nThese are actions more appropriate to a nightmarish anti-Nazi documentary, yet he's an American, he actually did these things, and he was pardoned by the US president for murdering children and mutilating bodies.

This captivating voyage has reshaped industries, redefined human-computer interaction, and opened up a world of untapped potential.\nLet's embark on a journey through time, exploring the milestones that have shaped the history of machine learning and the pioneers who have made it all possible.\nKey Takeaways\nMachine Learning can be traced back to the 1940s, with early pioneers such as Walter Pitts and Warren McCulloch laying its foundations.\nThe emergence of probability theory in the 1980s revolutionized ML, leading to sophisticated algorithms and applications.\nModern Machine Learning has experienced a series of breakthroughs that have significantly improved its capabilities & presented potential for AI across various industries - from DeepMind's AlphaGo victory in 2016 to GPT-4 & Claude AI today;\nAutoML takes modern machine learning even further, allowing non-developers to operate on large-scale projects. Platforms like Akkio are leading the pack in the upscaling of citizen developers for data analysis.\nThe Birth of Machine Learning: Early Pioneers and Concepts\nA machine learning algorithm visualized by MidJourney AI\nThe roots of machine learning can be traced back to the 1940s, when researchers began to explore very basic pattern recognition and the development of the first neural networks. This early period of ML history was marked by groundbreaking ideas and the relentless pursuit of creating computers that could mimic human thought processes. In 1943, Walter Pitts and Warren McCulloch devised the first mathematical model of a neural network, laying the groundwork for modern neural networks and the development of distributed machine learning toolkits.\nPioneers like Donald Hebb, Alan Turing, and Arthur Samuel, although not the sole originators, significantly contributed to the evolution of machine learning. Hebb's work on neuron communication, Turing's test for artificial intelligence, and Samuel's coining of the term \"machine learning\" all contributed to the burgeoning field of artificial intelligence (AI) and laid the foundation for the myriad of machine learning algorithms we know today.\nThe First Neural Network (1943)\nIn 1943, Walter Pitts and Warren McCulloch took a significant step forward in the history of machine learning by developing the first neural network model to incorporate an electric circuit. Their mathematical model aimed to address a challenge posed by John von Neumann and others: how could computers be enabled to communicate with one another? The result was a groundbreaking moment in the history of machine learning, which would go on to inspire countless researchers to explore the untapped potential of artificial neural networks.\nPitts and McCulloch's contributions served as a foundation for future machine learning developments by showcasing the potential for computers to learn, adapt, and improve when faced with complex tasks. Their pioneering work on neural networks:\nServed as a catalyst for subsequent research and innovation\n\nQuestion: What was the focus of Alan Turing's test for artificial intelligence? Answer: To determine whether a machine could exhibit intelligent behavior equivalent to, or indistinguishable from, that of a human.", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "10a88d29-2767-4866-ae1d-a76380c60faf", "url": "https://www.akkio.com/post/history-of-machine-learning"}
{"text": "Besides, according to TorHoerman Law, some baby formulas can cause fatal gastrointestinal disease in premature babies. Many such cases of necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) in babies were reported by consumers of popular formula manufacturers Similac and Enfamil. Because of these NEC cases, the NEC baby formula lawsuit was filed.\nAs per the latest NEC lawsuit update, the NEC infant formula lawsuit has currently tripled in size since the start of 2023. It started with fewer than 100 cases. Thus, it's evident that baby formulas boast severe health risks and can't be fully trusted, even when it comes to reputed brands.\nBreastfeeding Supports Brain Development\nBreast milk is not just nourishment for the body. As reported by the Nuffield Department of Population Health, it also supports brain and cognitive development. It contains essential fatty acids like DHA (docosahexaenoic acid) and AA (arachidonic acid).\nThese are crucial for the growth and development of the infant's brain and nervous system. These nutrients are essential for cognitive functions, including learning and memory.\nSome baby formulas are enriched with DHA and AA. However, they may not be as readily absorbed or as bioavailable as the natural forms found in breast milk. Breastfeeding provides infants with the best possible source of these essential fatty acids, which can have a lasting positive impact on their cognitive development.\nBreastfeeding Promotes Proper Oral and Facial Development\nThe physical act of breastfeeding involves a unique set of movements that contribute to proper oral and facial development in infants. Babies use their facial muscles differently when breastfeeding compared to bottle-feeding, which can help shape their oral and facial structures correctly. The sucking motion required during breastfeeding supports the development of a strong and well-aligned palate and jaw.\nIn contrast, bottle-feeding, especially with a traditional bottle and nipple design, may not encourage the same natural oral and facial muscle development. Prolonged reliance on baby formula and bottle-feeding may increase the risk of oral issues, such as misalignment of teeth and other dental problems.\nConclusion\nNow that we've established all the facts, it should be evident why breastfeeding is superior to baby formulas. Thus, if you're a soon-to-be mom, don't grow too dependent on baby formulas. They can be used from time to time but never as full substitutes for breastmilk.\n\nQuestion: Are the forms of DHA and AA in baby formulas as readily absorbed as in breast milk? Answer: No, they may not be as readily absorbed or as bioavailable as the natural forms found in breast milk", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "415b7b9c-22f1-41d5-933c-4804e4eb4aee", "url": "https://www.thetalka.org/baby-formula-vs-breastfeeding-why-the-latter-is-better/"}

Sampling is widely used in statistical analysis because analyzing\na subset of data gives similar results to analyzing all of the data.\nIn addition, sampling speeds up processing for reports when the volume\nof data is so large as to slow down report queries.\nIn layman's terms this means that when there is a large amount of data we can take a chunk of that data and analyze based upon that sample. When looking at large data sets it can often be faster to analyse upon a sample rather then the full data set. However one must always take into account that the results will not be 100% the same as if you had done the analysis upon the full data set.\nGoogle Analytics handle's sampling is as follows:\nAnalytics inspects the number of sessions for the specified date range\nat the property level. If the number of sessions in the property over\nthe given date range exceeds 500k sessions (100M for Analytics 360)1,\nAnalytics will employ a sampling algorithm which uses a sample set\nproportional to the distribution of sessions by day for the selected\ndate range.

{"text": "\"The goal of City Limits was not only to get our community talking about these issues but to inspire our listeners to take action,\" says Lee. He wanted the students to see that their reporting could be impactful, could change things, could make the community better. He points to one of many anecdotal pieces of evidence that they did just that. \"Two of our listeners heard a story we did on a ride-to-work program run by Providence Services to help people get better jobs by solving their transportation problems. The listeners were so touched by the story, they purchased used cars and donated them to the individuals featured in the story.\"\nContemplating next steps in the evolution of WAER programming, Lee is focused on making the community a real partner in telling important stories. He's inspired by a model put forth by a consulting firm called Hearken (which means \"listen\") generating public-powered journalism through relevant and original stories.

{"text": "Extreme Value Theory: Looking for the unusual\nWhether we're famous statisticians or just regular people, we look towards the majority. We even have terms for this, like groupthink. Traditionally, statisticians take data and focus their analysis on the majority of the data. But what if we didn't want to look at the majority? What if we wanted to focus on the extremes of a dataset?\nTurns out there's an entire area of statistics dedicated to researching rare occurring events which statisticians aptly named it Extreme Value Theory (EVT). But why would anyone look extreme values? Well, think about rare events like flooding. The picture above (credit to: myself) was taken in York, February 2020, when the River Ouse flooded, disrupting a lot of businesses and causing lots of damage. If you look closely, you can see water coming out of a letterbox, which is not ideal.\nRiver levels fluctuate every day but they don't flood every day. The majority of the data of river levels show the river levels to be quite low, but extreme cases of river levels causes flooding which is detrimental to people's lives and livelihoods.\nRiver level data for the River Ouse between January 2013 to February 2021. Each point is the average river level (in metres) for a day. The red line is the mean of the whole data set.\nThe image above shows a plot of the river levels of the River Ouse across the last 8 years, with each point showing the average river level of a single day. The red line represents the mean (average) river level of the data. The majority of the data, as you can see, lies below 1m. By using the whole data set to calculate the mean, the mean lies drastically lower than the highest river levels, the levels at which flooding occurs. So using this mean estimate on the whole data would be futile when preparing flood defences for future flooding.\nThis is where Extreme Value Theory comes in.\nDistribution of Maxima\nA distribution is a mathematical function that describes how data is, well, distributed (or spread). Statisticians love to fit distributions to data, it's like an addiction. Got some data? Let's model it with some distribution. This is no different with extremes. We want to model the behaviour of outliers in data, like high river levels. However, high river levels are rare so we don't have that much data for it. So what should we do? Should we wait? Well ideally not, the pub and shop owners won't be happy if we wait for 100 years for data before building flood defences to help them.\nWell we know that flooding occurs at high river levels, so instead of using all river level data, let's just take the highest values, or the maxima. The image below shows the maximum river level in each year, highlighted in red.\nRiver level data for the River Ouse. The maximum river level in each year from January 2013 to February 2021 are highlighted in red.\n\nQuestion: What is the main focus of Extreme Value Theory (EVT)?

{"text": "Included are the stories of Rockefeller, Morgan, Vanderbilt, Carnegie, Harriman, Gould and Frick. The book is pretty uneven, some sections are dreadfully dull and endlessly repetitive, while others zip by like lightning. First published in 1934 at the height of the Great Depression, this is a damning look at the men who arose around the Civil War and after and how they basically looted the country with government give-aways of land and tax breaks railroads. Franklin, the historic Yankee, the legendary Self- made Man, owed his success as a printer as much to his strict attention to new machinery studied in London as to his good and prudent business management; just as in journalism he owed his success to enterprise in the current of new ideas. In a fascinating narrative, mixing social, economic, and political history, Josephson shows that under the command of these industry titans, the country progressed from a mainly agrarian-mercantile society to an economy propelled predominantly by mass production. The definitive book on the rise and power of early American capitalists, The Robber Barons examines the careers of such masters of finance and industry as J. The Cultural Front: The Laboring of American Culture in the Twentieth Century.\nRobber baron (industrialist)\nThese robber barons, as were their medieval counterparts, were the dominating figures of an aggressive economic age. Perhaps a new opportunity to right the ship will emerge in this new decade. Completely separately, the dollar values that are set forth on some of the transactions are staggering; particularly if you transform them into today's dollars and realize that a single person was often behind the bulk of the financing. Were these men philanthropists that improved society or monopolists that controlled prices for their benefit? I enjoyed the tremendous depths this book plumbed, but disliked the quick gloss of effects to unions, riots, labor disputes, and just the general effect of the emassing of riches on the everyday man. As in the case of Franklin, so in the other early Self-made Men of the young Republic we may study the naked process of change from the early stages of industrialism to the more advanced. There are fascinating characters here: Daniel Drew, Cornelius Vanderbilt, Jay Gould, Jay Cooke, John D.

{"text": "Why Period Cramps Happen and 5 Things to Do to Relieve Them\nAll across the globe, more than half of women who menstruate experience dysmenorrhea or period pain for about two days every month. Although period pain can also mean general discomfort and headaches, cramps are the worst. Menstrual cramps typically happen when the uterus contracts to shed its lining. This pain can radiate and also cause pain in your lower abdomen, lower back, upper thighs and groin. Just like you need to know how to wear a menstrual cup, you also need to understand why period cramps happen and how you can relieve the pain.\nWhat Causes Period Pain?\nSome women are simply confused about why they are the only woman in their family with chronic cramps or why their painful periods didn't start until their 20s. Whatever your situation is, period cramps can happen due to a multitude of reasons. Let's dive into some of them!\nOne of the first and most typical causes of period cramps is PMS or Premenstrual Syndrome when estrogen and progesterone levels dip and this causes cramps, mood swings and fatigue.\nPMDD or Premenstrual dysphoric disorder is a severe form of PMS that also causes cramps. However, unlike PMS, women with PMDD experience high levels of stress and the cramps are more intense.\nUterine fibroids also cause cramps. They develop in the uterine lining during the childbearing years and shrink or completely vanish after menopause.\nOvarian cysts are harmless sacs of fluids forming in the ovaries during ovulation. Sometimes ovarian cysts can also cause PCOS which causes hormone imbalance and leads to painful and irregular periods.\nEndometriosis is a condition in which the endometrium or the uterine lining grows outside the uterus. This abnormality can cause painful cramps and lead to irritation and inflammation.\nPID or Pelvic Inflammatory disease can also cause cramps. This is a condition when the ovaries and uterus get infected and the infection typically starts with bacteria from an STI.\nHow to Relieve Period Cramps?\nDealing with menstrual cramps can be painful as well as frustrating. The good news is some remedies can work to ease mild and chronic pain. These include the following:\nReduce the bloating by drinking more water as bloating can cause pain and discomfort.\nHerbal teas have antispasmodic and anti-inflammatory properties so drink herbal tea to reduce muscle spasms in the uterus that cause cramping.\nTry eating tomatoes, berries, pineapples and spices like ginger, and turmeric garlic to promote blood flow to the uterus. You can also have leafy green vegetables, walnuts, almonds, and fish like salmon to reduce the inflammation.\nSkip the sugary treats and keep a hot water bag handy to avoid the extra bloating.\nConclusion\n\nQuestion: What is the typical duration of menstrual pain for women who experience it? Answer: About two days every month\n\nQuestion: What are uterine fibroids and when do they typically develop? Answer: Uterine fibroids are growths in the uterine lining that develop during the childbearing years.", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "34cfe167-e5d7-415c-af82-b21ad5f5f1ad", "url": "https://shecup.com/why-period-cramps-happen-and-5-things-to-do-to-relieve-them/"}

These components work together to manage asthma symptoms effectively.\nThe Significance of Seroflo in Asthma Management\nAsthma is a chronic condition characterized by airway inflammation and bronchoconstriction, leading to symptoms such as coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath.\nSeroflo is significant in managing asthma because it addresses both the inflammation and bronchoconstriction that contribute to asthma symptoms.\nBy reducing airway inflammation (Fluticasone) and relaxing the muscles in the airways (Salmeterol), Seroflo helps patients breathe more easily and reduces the frequency and severity of asthma attacks.\nIt's crucial to understand that while Seroflo can provide significant relief, it is not a cure for asthma. Instead, it helps control the condition, improving patients' quality of life and reducing the risk of severe asthma exacerbations.\nKey Components of Seroflo\nSeroflo's effectiveness in asthma treatment is attributed to its active ingredients: Salmeterol and Fluticasone.\nSalmeterol is a long-acting beta-agonist (LABA) that works by relaxing the muscles in the airways, allowing them to open up and making it easier to breathe. It provides 12 hours of bronchodilation, making it suitable for twice-daily dosing.\nFluticasone is a corticosteroid that reduces inflammation in the airways. It helps prevent the swelling and mucus production that contribute to asthma symptoms.\nThe combination of these two ingredients in Seroflo addresses both the bronchoconstriction and inflammation seen in asthma, providing comprehensive symptom management.\nSeroflo Composition and Ingredients\nSeroflo is a medication that plays a vital role in managing asthma, and its effectiveness is closely tied to its composition and ingredients. In this section, we will delve into the details of what makes up Seroflo and how its active components, Salmeterol and Fluticasone, work together to effectively manage asthma symptoms.\nUnderstanding Seroflo's Composition\nSeroflo is a combination medication used for asthma treatment. It belongs to a class of drugs known as combination inhalers, which means it contains multiple active ingredients in a single inhaler device.\nThe primary components of Seroflo are Salmeterol and Fluticasone, which work synergistically to provide comprehensive asthma symptom control.\nActive Ingredients in Seroflo\nSalmeterol:\n\nQuestion: Is Seroflo a quick-relief inhaler? Answer: No, Seroflo is a long-term controller medication.\n\nQuestion: How does Salmeterol help in managing asthma? Answer: Salmeterol is a long-acting beta-agonist that relaxes the muscles in the airways, allowing them to open up and making it easier to breathe.\n\nQuestion: Which class of drugs does Seroflo belong to? Answer: Combination inhalers.", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "18e10c0e-b3cd-4d25-b503-b7e68953a82b", "url": "https://www.agpharmaceuticalsnj.com/navigating-seroflo-for-asthma-treatment-success-ingredients-dosage-administration-and-many-more.html"}

{"text": "Benefits of Being at a Higher Vibration\nHave you heard people talking about reaching a higher vibration? Are you uncertain about what it means or why it's so important? In this article, I'll address both of these questions so that you'll have a clearer understanding and hopefully be inspired to reach for a higher vibration for yourself and your life.\nWe all vibrate at a certain energy frequency. The lower your frequency, the more intense your energy feels and the more problems appear to weigh heavily on you. You may experience physical pain and discomfort in your physical body, as well as heavy emotions and mental confusion. Psychically, your energy becomes denser, and it takes a lot more effort to reach your goals. Generally, your life takes on a negative quality.\nThe higher the frequency of your energy or vibration, the lighter you feel in your physical, emotional, and mental bodies. You experience more personal power, clarity, peace, love, and joy. Any discomfort or pain in your physical body decreases, and your emotions become easily manageable. Your energy is literally filled with light. Your life flows with synchronicity, and you can easily manifest anything you desire. Generally, your life takes on a more positive quality.\nBeing in a higher vibration will become increasingly important for you and the world as you become more aware of the polarities between higher and lower vibrations. You'll start to perceive the great divide between \"dark\" and \"light\" as if you're living in two different worlds at once. You must consciously make a choice between dark and light or between higher and lower vibrations.\nDespair and helplessness caused by difficulties will consume vibrations with low frequency. You need to know that help can be received from people who vibrate at a higher frequency. Naturally, lower and denser energies will aspire to rise around higher and lighter energies. However, this process will cause discomfort for both people carrying lower energies and for a time for those carrying higher energies. It is very important to take care of the person who keeps his vibration high and not to lower it.\nPeople who resonate with a higher vibration can protect it, as long as they do not succumb to the pull of lower vibrations. This pull will come in the form of old programs and patterns that need approval or want to \"conform.\"\nWhen you choose to be at a higher vibration, you become an example. Choosing the light of a higher vibration requires a definite commitment, even when you feel like you no longer fit. Understand that you have the potential to raise the frequencies of those who are vibrating low. Remember that you will have the support you need to keep your light shining bright, you can find people who resonate at a higher frequency.\n\nQuestion: What does it mean to be at a higher vibration? Answer: Being at a higher vibration refers to having a higher energy frequency, which is associated with feeling lighter, more positive, and having more personal power, clarity, and peace.", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "595015c1-beea-4b73-9044-9b229dc7b521", "url": "https://www.spiritueller.org/spirituality/benefits-of-being-at-a-higher-vibration/"}
