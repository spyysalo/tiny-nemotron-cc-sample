{"text": "Rarity of Heathen Prayer in Historical Sources: Prayer is rare in historical sources related to Heathenry (Norse paganism). Only one instance of possible Heathen prayer is found in the 16 sagas of Heimskringla, out of 41 mentions of prayer, which are mostly Christian.\n\nPossible Heathen Prayer in Heimskringla: The one possible instance of Heathen prayer is in Ynglinga Saga, where Odin, near death, dedicates himself all men who die by weapons and says he will go to the Godheims to welcome his friends. After his death, the Swedes resume their belief in Odin and prayers to him.\n\nDebated Prayer in the Poetic Edda: The poem Sigrdrífumál (stanzas 3-4) is often interpreted as a prayer, but its status as such is debated. It includes invocations to gods and goddesses, requests for wisdom, good speech, and healing hands.\n\nOld Saxon Language: The text mentions that in Old Saxon, the noun \"Beda\" for \"prayer\" and the verb \"bedon\" for \"to pray\" occur. However, these words are often used in a Christian context due to the prevalence of commentaries on Psalms and homilies in Old Saxon poetry.\n\nOld Saxon Words for Prayer and Asking: The Old Saxon word for \"to ask\" is \"bidan\", which is also related to the word for \"prayer\". This is reflected in the modern English phrase \"I bid you\".\n\nGoogle Search Challenges: Searching for \"Heathen Prayer\" or \"Viking Prayer\" on Google yields results dominated by modern Asatruar prayers, prayers from TV shows like Vikings (which are Christian), and articles about Christian or Muslim prayer, making it difficult to find historical Heathen prayer information.\n\nPrayer in Beowulf and Ibn Fadlan's Accounts: The text mentions that Beowulf does not contain any prayers, and Ibn Fadlan recorded a prayer among the Rus, but these are not elaborated upon.", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "839744a5-9487-4b03-96d7-04ce8fa4cc4d", "url": "https://www.aldsidu.com/post/heathen-prayer-a-historical-perspective"}
