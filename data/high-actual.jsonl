{"text": "Avoid Frying When Flying: Eliminate Ionizing Radiation When You Travel\n\n(NaturalNews) What do airport back-scatter scanners, Wifi on planes and modern day telecommunications have in common? Ionizing radiation. Radiation is nothing but energy. It is both friend and foe and is a natural phenomenon we couldn't live without. Ionizing radiations are types of waves of electric and magnetic (electromagnetic) energy with the ability to attract electrons from other atoms. This is where the problem lies. When ionizing radiation is absorbed by the human body it has the potential to damage our atoms in our DNA encouraging disease and creating toxins known as free radicals in the process.\n\nConcern about ionizing radiation exposure and flying dates back to NASA astronauts and studies of long haul airline crews. It is something that should concern everyone who steps on a plane for a number of reasons. First is technology; the more technologically driven we are as a society the more stressed we have become. Mobile phones, wireless networks, medical diagnostics and flying make up parts of our lifestyle. Exposure to these sources of ionizing and non ionizing forms of radiation is on the increase and often without our consent. Second, even if you abhor technology chances are that if you switch on a mobile phone it will pick up the networks of people living around you (which means you're being exposed); you have no control over your exposure. This same loss of control is now being suggested as the debate on whether Wifi should be encouraged or discouraged on planes increases. The more sinister problem about ionizing radiation on planes, whether from Wifi or outside the plane, is that our natural protection at sea level is absent on planes.\n\nThere is no \"cure\" for radiation exposure. The best you can do is reduce its impact on your health. The current government advice on radiation basics uses a 3 point model: distancing yourself from the source, reducing the time spent in the environment where ionizing radiation is present and shielding yourself from radiation. The downside to this advice is that as a flier you don't have much control over the first two points. The flight time and altitude are determined by the flight crew and factors of the day. The good news is that the third factor is good advice you can act on using informed dietary choices, supportive technology and lifestyle choices.\n\nFliers should make efforts to add high antioxidant foods to their diet because they mop up the free radicals created by ionizing radiation. If you can't get them from food, supplement. Consider naturally occurring Vitamin C, Active COQ10- Ubiquinol and Glutathione. Supportive technology tools include all types of grounding equipment you can use in and around the house, to lessen the radiation emitted by the gadgets we use daily. Grounding sheets and pads are available for beds and computer work stations respectively. Even simpler to implement is a timer on your wireless router - setting the timer to switch off your router when you are in bed stops you from being bombarded with radiation while you sleep. Lifestyle choices include routinely living a more balanced life. Being out in nature and connecting with nature is the best remedy.\n\nIt is a little known fact that the Earth is covered in an inexhaustible number of negative electrons which are restorative and healing. These same negative electrons are partly what's missing at altitude and cause the air on planes to be dry and stuffy. Adjusting your lifestyle to make sure you absorb as much of these electrons really is the master key to eliminating ionizing radiation from your flying", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "f42b4f0e-eb41-4c0a-b7d3-c615780be0f0", "url": "http://www.naturalnews.com/030425_radiation_flying.html"}

{"text": "\"A War to End All Wars\"\n(1914-1918)\nThe First World War is historically important for its causes and\neffects more so than specific events surrounding actual battles.\nThis page will deal with the long-range and more immediate causes of\nWorld War I, the technological advances created during the war, some\naspects of WWI battles, and the far-reaching effects of the conflict\non Europe and the rest of the world.\n\nEurope as a\nPowder-Keg The fundamental causes of the World War I, or the\nGreat War as it was known at the time, were Imperialism, Militarism,\nAlliance System, and Nationalism.\n\nImperialism and\nnationalism led to increased production of goods and economic stability in\nthese countries, which resulted in an arms race. The aggressive attitude of\nthis policy drove them into producing more weaponry, such as\nstrong navies and armored vehicles.\n\nAlliance System\n\nThe\nalliances of Europe were formed for protection against each\nother. However, the Triple Entente and the\nTriple Alliance\nvery quickly took aggressive postures towards one another.\nThis is due in large part to the lack of any global organization\ndesigned to promote peace among the nations of the world.\n\nNationalism\nwas both a uniting force and a divisive one. It resulted\nin Germany and Italy uniting into strong nations, and also\ncaused the disintegration of the\nOttoman Empire and Austria-Hungary.\n\nAt the turn of the century, war was imminent. As\nnationalism weakened the\nOttoman Empire, the\nSlavic peoples of the Balkan region struggled\nto free themselves from Ottoman control. Serbia\ndeclared independence in 1878, allying themselves to Russia.\nSerbia then wanted to unite with Bosnia and Herzegovina,\nwhich were controlled by Austria-Hungary. Serbia could count\non Russia's support, and Austria-Hungary could count on Germany's.\nBecause of the high tensions in this area, the Balkans became known\nas the \"Powder Keg of Europe.\" All that was\nneeded to ignite the world into war was a spark.\n\nThe Spark In 1914, Austrian\nArchduke Franz Ferdinand\nand his wife were\nvisiting Sarajevo, the capital of Bosnia and Herzegovina.\nGavrilo Princip, of the\nSerbian nationalist group called theBlack Hand, assassinated the Archduke and his wife.\nAustria-Hungary made threats to Serbia, whom they blamed for the\nassassination. Russia supported Serbia, and readied their\nmilitary for war. Germany declared war on Russia, and on\nFrance, Russia's ally. Germany then invaded Belgium as a prelude to\ninvading France. This resulted in Great Britain declaring war\non Germany, which was the start of World War I.\n\nAspects of World War\nI Most of World War I was a stalemate. Entrenched\npositions on both sides were only able to move a few miles in a\nbattle that lasted the better part of a year. The conditions\nof trench warfare were brutal; trench-foot, disease, lice,\nand inadequate supplies made fighting difficult. Advances in technology also played a\nmajor role. The machine gun, the tank, the airplane, the\nsubmarine, and the use of poison gas drastically changed the face of\nmodern war, and resulted in large numbers of casualties.\n\nThe Aftermath and its\nImpact on Subsequent Events Overwhelming odds and weariness forced an end to the fighting\nwith the defeat of the Central Powers. The peace conference\nthat followed was headed by the \"Big Four,\" David Lloyd George of Britain,\nGeorges Clemenceau of France,\nVittorio Orlando of Italy, and\nWoodrow Wilson of the United\nStates. Together, they drafted the Treaty of\nVersailles, signed in 1919, which officially ended the war. Wilson tried\nto institute his 14 Points but was largely rejected.\nHowever, the League of Nations was created as a result and\nattempted to act as the peacekeeper of Europe. Unfortunately,\nit was weak and ineffectual due to the absence of the United States.\n\nThe treaty, however, was more about revenge, than it was about\nforging a lasting peace. Germany was forced to accept total\nresponsibility for the start of the war. They also were forced\nto pay huge reparations, and give over vast amounts of territory.\nThe start of World War II is a direct result of the harsh treatment\nof Germany after World War I.\n\nWorld War II (1939-1945)\nThe\nrise of the fascist\nAdolf Hitler and the formation of German\ntotalitarianism is\ndirectly related to the Versailles Treaty.\nHitler blamed the treaty for Germany's economic trouble and\nmade a call for German patriotism. The Nazi Party quickly came\nto power in the early 1930's and used terror to achieve its goal of\na strong German nation. The most obvious example of this is anti-Semitism, the blaming of the Jewish people for many German\nproblems. Benito Mussolini, the fascist leader\nof Italy, had a similar rise and utilized the same policies.\nWithout the negative influence of the Versailles Treaty, Germans and\nItalians may not\nhave supported the oppressive regimes of Hitler and Mussolini.\n\nCauses of World War\nII World\nWar II was fought for many of the same reasons\nas the First\nWorld War. The Axis Powers, Germany,\nItaly, and Japan, were hungry for territory and resources.\nInstitutions like the League of Nations, and peace treaties\nsuch as the Kellogg-Briand Pact, were weak and ineffectual. The\nimmediate cause of WWII was the policy of\nappeasement adopted\nby the Allied Powers of Europe, and eventually the United States. Germany, as it\nhad previous to WWI, was using nationalism and militarism to\nimperialize surrounding areas. Austria and portions of\nCzechoslovakia were taken by Germany in direct violation of the\ndictations of the Versailles Treaty. Likewise, Italy had taken\nEthiopia, and Japan had imperialized much of China.\n\nUnder the\nleadership of Neville Chamberlain, British Prime Minister, a\nconference was called in Munich in 1938. Appeasement\nbecame the official policy when Hitler was allowed to keep what was\nalready taken if he promised to stop taking territory from that\npoint forward. The futile hopes of appeasement were quickly\ndashed when Hitler annexed the remainder of Czechoslovakia.\nThe worst fears were realized when Hitler invaded Poland in 1939\nusing the blitzkrieg tactic. Blitzkrieg, or Lightening Warfare used\nall available military resources to attack the target\nsimultaneously. The invasion of Poland marks the beginning of\nWorld War II.\n\nAspects of World War\nII WWII is divided into two areas, the European Theater and\nthe Pacific Theater. In Europe, Germany had quickly taken over large\namounts of territory. France fell after\nFrench and British troops were pushed off of the European mainland\nat Dunkirk. Then, Germany failed to win the\nBattle of Britain\nin the skies over England. Italian and German troops gained control of the Mediterranean and the North coast of Africa.\n\nGermany also attacked the Soviet Union, despite the secret\nagreement between Hitler and Josef Stalin, which stated neither would\nattack the other. This proved Germany's undoing as it had\nin World War I, as a two-front war is nearly impossible to win.\nThe Battle of Stalingrad was the turning point of the war in\nEurope. After this Soviet victory, Allied troops retook Africa and then move on to take\nthe Italian peninsula. Mussolini's Italy was considered the\nweak point of Europe. After the daring D-Day\ninvasion of Normandy, and Germany's last-ditch effort in the Battle\nof the Bulge, it was only a matter of time before Berlin\nfell.\n\nHitler committed suicide as Soviet troops took the\ncity in the spring of 1945. The surviving Nazis that were\ncaptured were held accountable for their war crimes in the\nNuremburg Trials. The atrocities of the\nHolocaust would come to light, resulting in the execution of\nNazi Party officials and ending the darkest segment of human\nhistory.", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "99d8d5f1-079c-4779-ac5c-74222491f293", "url": "http://regentsprep.org/Regents/global/themes/conflict/worldwars.cfm"}
{"text": "Main menu\n\nThe story of the glory of God (Part 2)\n\nIn part 2 of Rob Smith's series on glory, we see the story of God's glory brought to a ringing climax in the person and work of Jesus Christ. (Read part 1.)\n\n10 July 2009 marks exactly 500 years since the birth of John Calvin, arguably the greatest Christian mind of the Protestant Reformation. As any of his biographers and his own writings will testify, Calvin was a man obsessed with the glory of God. Indeed, the great Princeton theologian Benjamin Warfield once wrote, \"Into the heart of none more than into his did the vision of the glory of God shine, and no one has been more determined than he not to give the glory of God to another\".1 In his reply to the Roman Catholic cardinal Jacopo Sadoleto, Calvin himself put it like this:\n\nit is not very sound theology to confine a man's thoughts so much to himself, and not to set before him, as the prime motive of his existence, zeal to illustrate the glory of God. For we are born first of all for God, and not for ourselves. As all things flowed from him, and subsist in him, so, says Paul, (Rom xi. 36,) they ought to be referred to him.2\n\nIn Part 1 of this two-part series on the story of God's glory, we began to see that Calvin's concerns are none other than the concerns of God's own self-revelation in Scripture. In an all too brief survey of the Old Testament, we explored a number of the key 'glory connections' and 'glory associations' (in particular, the name of God, the grace of God and the tabernacle/temple of God), and ended by seeing that Israel's hope lay in the building of a new temple that would so be filled with God's glory, it would function as the ultimate place of revelation and reconciliation (e.g. Ezek 40-48). But what was this new temple the Old Testament prophets foresaw? How would their prophecies be fulfilled? Was it destined for literal (brick and mortar) fulfilment in some future millennial age? Or did God have something even more wonderful and permanent in mind?3\n\n1. The glory of God and the Son of God\n\na) The tabernacle incarnate\n\nAccording to the New Testament, the fulfilment of the Old Testament prophecies concerning the new temple is found in the person and work of one who was both son of David and Son of God—the Lord Jesus Christ. This is what John was speaking about when he penned these words in the opening chapter of his Gospel:\n\nAnd the Word became flesh and dwelt among us, and we have seen his glory, glory as of the only Son from the Father, full of grace and truth. (John 1:14).\n\nThe connections with Exodus 33-34 are hard to miss. Not only does John use the language of 'dwelling' or 'tabernacling', he links it with the language of 'glory'. Furthermore, he does so in a context revelatory of God's name and nature (vv. 12, 18)—a revelation that clearly surpasses that given to Moses (v. 17).4 A new tabernacle has arrived.\n\nBut John's statement is even more profound when seen in the wider context of his prologue, for the new tabernacle is none other than the divine, eternal Word of God, by whom all things have been made and in whom is all life and light (vv. 1-5). Indeed, this is the same Word who once expressed his will in the form of laws written on tablets of stone, the symbol of God's revealing and reconciling rule over Israel (v. 17). He has now, however, taken human form and become human flesh. In other words, the new tabernacle/temple is none other than Jesus Christ, God the Son incarnate (v. 14).\n\nb) The new temple builder\n\nJesus, then, is the living, breathing presence of God in our midst—\"God with us\" (Matt 1:23). As the new tent of meeting—the true bridge between heaven and earth (John 1:51)—he is the ultimate place of both revelation and reconciliation (John 1:18, 14:9, 1:29, 19:30). Moreover, as the Christ, he is not only the ultimate expression of God's rule, but as the great son of David, he is also the new temple builder (cf. 2 Sam 7). At first glance, this presents something of a puzzle: how does the new temple build himself?\n\nIn John 2, just after Jesus revealed his \"glory\" through his first sign in Cana (v. 11), John records Jesus' act of cleansing the Jerusalem temple (fulfilling Ps 69:9). The key statement comes when the Jews press him for a sign to prove his authority (v. 18). Jesus says, \"Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up\" (v. 19). The Jews are somewhat bemused by his reply. But Jesus, as John tells us, was referring to \"the temple of his body\" (v. 21)—a fact the disciples only understood once Jesus had been raised from the dead (v. 22). The point, however, is clear: Jesus himself is the promised new temple—the fulfilment and replacement of the old.5\n\nc) Jesus' hour of glory\n\nJesus' statement in John 2:19 also helps us to appreciate something of profound importance. While Jesus was the new temple from the moment of his birth, and genuinely revealed God's glory throughout his ministry, there is a crucial sense in which the temple is not yet 'open for business'. Jesus will only fully function as the new temple of God when he has been 'destroyed' and 'raised up'—or, to use Jesus' language elsewhere in John's Gospel, once he has been \"glorified\" (e.g. 7:39, 12:16, 13:31).\n\nThis is why, for most of his ministry, Jesus made very clear that his full glorification or \"hour\" of glory had \"not yet come\" (e.g. 2:4, 7:6, 8, 30, 39). Its arrival, however, is unambiguously signalled with the following announcement:\n\n\"The hour has come for the Son of Man to be glorified. Truly, truly, I say to you, unless a grain of wheat falls into the earth and dies, it remains alone; but if it dies, it bears much fruit … … (John 12:23-24, 27-28, 30-33)\n\nThe cross, then, is the place where the glory of God fills the new temple and where the name and knowledge of God (the Father and the Son) is most fully manifested (John 17:1-5). It is likewise the place where the love of God is fully demonstrated, as the good shepherd lays down his life for his sheep (John 10:11) in order to take away the sins of the world (John 1:29). In short, the cross is the place where the revelation of God's glory is fully and finally given, and the reconciliation of sinners fully and finally accomplished.\n\nHowever, the full glorification of Jesus is not complete until the new temple has been raised up and then glorified in the Father's presence with the glory that was his \"before the world existed\" (John 17:5). In other words, it's not until Jesus has risen from the dead and has ascended to the Father that the new temple is fully and finally operational.\n\n2. The glory of God and the church of God\n\na) Christ's gift of glory\n\nThis brings us to the next chapter in the 'story of glory'. The plan of God was never to simply display his glory and leave it at that, nor was it to glorify himself at the expense of his creatures. Rather, God's eternal commitment to glorify himself has always been with a view to sharing his glory with those \"vessels of mercy\" whom he \"prepared beforehand for glory\" (Rom 9:23). Put another way, God's eternal purpose to create and redeem a people for \"the praise of his glory\" cannot be rightly understood apart from our participation in that glory (Eph 1:12, 14; Rom 5:2, 8:30). This is both theologically mind-blowing and spiritually stunning. What it means is that Christ's glorification was not only for himself, but also for others.6\n\nBut how is it possible for sinful creatures to so obtain \"the freedom of the glory of the children of God\" that we actually become \"partakers of the divine nature\" (Rom 8:21; 2 Pet 1:4)? The answer is through the gift of the Holy Spirit. For as the victory of the crucified Christ is proclaimed, the now glorified Christ pours out the Spirit (the gift of God's own glorious indwelling presence) on all who believe in him (John 7:38-39). His purpose is that we might know the love that the Father and the Son have for each other from the inside—for the Spirit both \"proceeds from the Father\" and is \"the Spirit of his Son\" (John 15:26; Gal. 4:6). This reality is the denouement of Jesus' prayer: \"The glory that you have given me I have given to them, that they may be one even as we are one\" (John 17:22).\n\nThe Holy Spirit, then, is \"the bond of our union with Christ, the one who comes from his side of the relationship over to ours and enables us to receive and to respond\".7 For this reason, he bears witness with our spirit that we are God's children, authoring and enabling the cry \"Abba! Father!\" (Rom 8:14-16). We thus have divine confirmation that we are \"fellow heirs with Christ\" and that our ultimate destiny is to be \"glorified with him\" (Rom 8:17).\n\nb) Glory in the church\n\nFar from leaving the temple theme behind at this point, the New Testament now develops it in a wonderfully new direction. The same Spirit who joins believers to Christ (the true temple) also unites us together in him, and in so doing, establishes the church (and every local expression of it) as \"the temple of the living God\" (2 Cor 6:16). As Paul says to the Corinthians, \"Do you not know that you are God's temple and that God's Spirit dwells in you? If anyone destroys God's temple, God will destroy him. For God's temple is holy, and you are that temple.\" (1 Cor 3:16-17).8\n\nOf course, it is not as though the church has somehow replaced Christ; that is neither how the theology nor the imagery works. Christ is the \"foundation\" or \"cornerstone\" upon which the temple is being built (1 Cor 3:11; Eph 2:20). It cannot exist apart from him. As David Peterson remarks, \"Christians in union with Christ fulfil the Temple ideal\".9 The Apostle Paul stresses this very point:\n\nin whom [Christ] the whole structure, being joined together, grows into a holy temple in the Lord. In him you also are being built together into a dwelling place for God by the Spirit. (Eph 2:21-22)\n\nThe church, then, is utterly dependent on its union with Christ and the indwelling of his Spirit if it is to be on earth what it is already in \"the heavenly places\" (Eph 1:3, 2:6). For, as Peter O'Brien notes, \"glory can be ascribed to God only within the realm of Christ Jesus\".10 The new temple, then, must remain founded on Christ, the \"cornerstone\", and faithful to the \"truth as it is in Jesus\" (Eph 2:20, 4:21). Filled with the Spirit, its mission is to build itself in love and so function as a witness to and a vehicle of praise to the glory of God in Christ (Eph 5:18, 4:16). This is why Paul prays,Eph 3:20-21)\n\nPeter's way of speaking of the business of the new temple is in terms of the offering of \"spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus Christ\" (1 Pet 2:5). In the context of Peter's first letter, such sacrifices are clearly not confined to the gatherings of believers (although they are not excluded from them either), but must include \"the whole pattern of obedient lifestyle set out in the central section of the letter\" (i.e. 1 Pet 2:11-4:19).11 Otherwise put, our glorification of God is both individual and corporate, public and private, involving our \"social conduct, praise and evangelism\".12\n\nc) The glory to be revealed\n\nAs the new temple, the church exists to magnify and make known the glory of God in Jesus Christ. It has also received glory, for \"we all, with unveiled face, beholding the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from one degree of glory to another\" (2 Cor 3:18). However, the full reality of that glory is presently hidden with Christ in God (Col 3:3). For, like our Lord, we have been called to walk a path of suffering. This is necessary, and a cause for rejoicing, for our being glorified with Christ in the future is on the proviso that \"we suffer with him\" in the present (Rom 5:3-5, 8:17; cf. 2 Tim 2:12). This is why Peter says,\n\nBeloved, do not be surprised at the fiery trial when it comes upon you to test you … Pet 4:12-14; cf. vv. 15-16)\n\nHere is a precious promise for each of us to take to heart: the Spirit of glory not only rests upon you in your sufferings, but \"after you have suffered a little while, the God of all grace, who has called you to his eternal glory in Christ, will himself restore, confirm, strengthen, and establish you\" (1 Pet 5:10). In other words, by God's power, we are being guarded for that day when Christ's glory will be fully revealed and every tongue will confess him as Lord, \"to the glory of God the Father\" (1 Pet 1:5; Phil 2:11).\n\nOn that day, tragically, some will \"suffer the punishment of eternal destruction, away from the presence of the Lord and from the glory of his might\" (2 Thess 1:9). Yet this too will display his glory—the glory of his justice (Rev 19:1-3). But the primary purpose of Christ's return is a saving one: he comes to be \"glorified in his saints, and to be marveled at among all who have believed\" (2 Thess 1:10).\n\nFinally, on that day, not only will our bodies be \"raised in glory\", being conformed to Christ's glorious body (1 Cor 15:43, Phil 3:21), but \"the creation itself will be set free from its bondage to corruption and obtain the freedom of the glory of the children of God\" (Rom 8:21). In that sense, not only will we, God's people, be God's dwelling place, but the whole world will become his glory-filled temple13 (Hab 2:14). This is the future that John speaks of in Revelation 21:\n\nThen I saw a new heaven and a new earth … …\" (Rev 21:1-3, 22-26)\n\nSharing in the story of glory\n\nSo then, how should we, as believers in Christ and joint heirs of his glory, participate in story of glory now? The answer is clear and simple: by being passionate in our pursuit of God's glory and single-minded in our desire that he receive \"the glory due his name\" (Ps 29:2, 96:8). This will mean not seeking glory for ourselves (for God will exult us at the proper time), but rather being jealous that God's glory is not given to lesser things (e.g. trivial goals and petty idols). Our modus operandi is summed up the Apostle Peter:\n\n… whoever speaks, as one who speaks oracles of God; whoever serves, as one who serves by the strength that God supplies—in order that in everything God may be glorified through Jesus Christ. (1 Pet 4:11).\n\nAs the focus of God's glory is \"the immeasurable riches of his grace in kindness toward us in Christ Jesus\" (Eph 2:7), those who are most conscious of this grace will be most conscientious in living for his glory. This certainly explains the self-denying and God-glorifying focus of John Calvin, and why, at the very end of his life in 1564, as part of his last will and testament, he could pen these moving words:\n\nI have lived amidst extraordinary struggles here; I have been saluted in mockery at night, before my door, by fifty or sixty shots from guns … While I am nothing, yet I know that I have prevented many problems that would otherwise have occurred in Geneva … God has given me the power to write, but I have written nothing out of hatred to any one, but I have always faithfully propounded what I esteemed to be for the glory of God.14\n\nCalvin's exhortation to us in the 21st century would, no doubt, simply be that of the Apostle Paul: \"whether you eat or drink, or whatever you do, do all to the glory of God\" (1 Cor 10:31). Soli Deo Gloria (\"to the glory of God alone\"): that must be our motto and the banner under which we march.\n\n3 Those who embrace a system of biblical interpretation known as Premillennial Dispensationalism usually hold that Ezekiel's temple will be rebuilt in Jerusalem during the 1,000-year earthly reign of Christ mentioned in Revelation 20:1-9. The temple (supposedly) will be built very near the site of the original temple. The animal sacrifices (which will again be offered in the new temple) are understood to be memorial, rather than atoning. As we'll see, the New Testament has a very different understanding of how Ezekiel's prophecy has already been fulfilled.\n\n4 See Bill Salier, 'The Temple of God in the Gospel of John' in Heaven on Earth: The Temple in Biblical Theology, edited by TD Alexander and S Gathercole, Paternoster, Carlisle, 2004, pp. 126-127", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "7408779b-2136-410e-89cb-17c20f774113", "url": "http://matthiasmedia.com/briefing/2009/08/the-story-of-the-glory-of-god-part-2/"}

{"text": " We don't have to stand idle while this wave of dementia swells\n\nJean Blake, CEO of the Alzheimer Society of B.C.\n\nPhotograph by: Submitted photo\n, Province files\n\nOne in four Canadians has someone in their family with Alzheimer's disease, a heartbreaking illness that impacts the entire family. Each person with dementia has at least two to three loved ones taking the journey with them. Caregivers for someone with dementia are twice as likely to experience symptoms of depression than those caring for someone with another chronic disease.\n\nThe ripple effect of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias extends beyond the family.\n\nOne third of employed family caregivers report disturbances in their work due to the caregiving responsibilities, twice as frequently as caregivers for persons without dementia. It is estimated the economic strain on the health-care system associated with an increased prevalence of dementia will skyrocket over the next 30 years to a cumulative total of more than $130.2 billion.\n\nWe know it is the second-most-feared disease among Canadian baby boomers.\n\nWe know that on the nearby horizon there is a rising tide of dementia.\n\nWe do not know the causes or the cure; it is irreversible, erodes ability and independence and eventually leads to death.\n\nHowever, we all can be doing more than just waiting on the shoreline watching this groundswell because in the meantime, 15,000 more British Columbians are diagnosed each year with a form of dementia.\n\nCurrently, among the 70,000 British Columbians living with dementia, about 10,000 are under the age of 65. These are individuals in the workforce.\n\nEmployers are in a position to inform employees about the increasing prevalence of dementia and how to access education programs such Brain Health … It's Your Business, which is offered by the Alzheimer Society of B.C. With the rising tide of dementia in the line of sight, employers can also prepare in advance by reviewing their own policies and practices in terms of support for caregiving, assistance with mental-health issues, and wellness programs or possible work accommodation for caregivers or persons in the early stages of dementia.\n\nThere is no known cure for dementia or treatment to prevent it. Policy-makers are tasked with ensuring a sustainable health-care system is in place to meet the needs of our aging population and increased prevalence of dementia. Our government leaders also have a responsibility to take measures that promote healthier lifestyles for better brain health and healthier communities, whether through access to community-based education, information and support, or through meaningful engagement in community activities, until a cure or effective treatment is found.\n\nThe Alzheimer Society of B.C. has had successful partnerships with the government, most recently the expansion of the First Link® program — an early intervention outreach initiative connecting families with support and education programs — to six communities across the province. Response from the first year of the expansion has already demonstrated a need to extend the program to all communities in B.C.\n\nEach individual is also responsible for their own brain health. Some risk factors are controllable, such as having a healthy lifestyle and wellness in body, mind, and spirit. Although the research is still not definitive, a healthy lifestyle has been shown to at least delay onset of dementia.\n\nIf you are already living with dementia, a healthy lifestyle can help you increase your well-being and possibly delay progression of the disease. Making healthy lifestyle choices is a good idea for anyone at any age because after all, what's good for the heart is good for the head. Learning about brain health and knowing the early signs of dementia are great ways to care for your brain.\n\nAfter all, if we're going to turn the rising tide, we first need to face it head on and take action", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "eef63b35-40cc-40d6-b79e-9444e77eed0a", "url": "http://www.theprovince.com/opinion/Essay+have+stand+idle+while+this+wave+dementia+swells/5472904/story.html"}
{"text": "Thursday, September 29, 2005\n\nGulliver's Travels\n\nIn 1937 Walt Disney and RKO released Snow White and the Seven Dwarves. The film was the first feature length American animated film. More than that, it was done in brilliant color with a wonderful story and charming characters. The songs were memorable and the film was a smash hit.\n\nIt shouldn't be too surprising that other studios noticed and 'jumped on the bandwagon.' The head of Paramount was the first of the bandwagon jumpers.\n\nSo, after a delightful ride around El Segundo he tipped the band, paid the wagon drive and hopped in a cab back to Hollywood. Soon after Paramount made a deal with Fleischer studios for their own feature length animated motion picture, Gulliver's Travels.\n\nMax Fleischer was arguably as big a name in the cartoon business as Walt Disney in 1937. Max had such popular stars as Betty Boop, Popeye and Superman in his stable.\n\nIf Gulliver's Travels had been able to duplicate the success of Snow White perhaps today the world would be very different.\n\nPerhaps millions would be vacationing in Max Fleischer World and Max Fleisher Pictures would be releasing mediocre sequels to Gulliver's Travels and other films.\n\nBut, it didn't happen. Gulliver just wasn't as successful as Snow White.\n\nThis isn't to say that it wasn't a success. Reaching theaters in 1939 (just two years after Snow White and BEFORE Disney's next project) Gulliver's Travels WAS a hit with audiences and garnered two Academy Award nominations for Best Original Music Score and Best Song. They lost both awards to The Wizard of Oz.\n\nThe film was made quickly, in less than half the time it took to make Snow White, yet the visuals were very impressive. Still, the story and characters didn't click with audiences the way that Sleepy, Dopey and company did.\n\nPerhaps the most memorable character in Gulliver is Gabby. Gabby is a little guy who looks a bit like Elmer Fudd. His cantankerous and was popular enough to be spin off into his own cartoon series after the show. This version of Gulliver's Travels is not faithful to the book version.\n\nIt tells of a man named Gulliver who washes ashore on an island full of people who are the size of Smurfs. Two kingdoms on the island are feuding over plans for a royal wedding. Gulliver is caught in the middle but uses his wits to help them.\n\nParamount no longer holds the copyright on this film so various different companies have released it. It is pretty easy to find in any bargain bin.\n\nMy copy was picked up at a dollar store and looks pretty good (all things considered.) You may like it too, so I recommending going to the dollar store ASAP and jump on the bandwagon.\n\nAsk the driver to take you by Redondo at night, it's beautiful. Also, ask the band to play a polka! The look they will give you is priceless!\n\n15 comments:\n\nInteresting note about this film: all the characters have 5 fingers! Most toons have 4! Look at the photo of the King above.

Like numbers refer to like elements throughout.\n\nReferring to FIG. 1, a detailed circuit diagram of a fully differential folded cascode CMOS operational amplifier 200 having both a common mode feedback section 160 and a bias circuit 170 according to a first preferred embodiment of the present invention is illustrated. Referring to FIG. 1, the fully differential folded cascode CMOS operational amplifier 200 has a differential input and a differential output. The differential input is comprised of a positive input terminal 10 and a negative input terminal 12, and the differential output is comprised of a positive output terminal 24 and a negative output terminal 26. An input voltage signal VIN is applied across the input terminals 10 and 12. The input voltage VIN includes two single-ended input voltages VINP and VINN applied to input terminals 10 and 12, respectively. An output voltage VOUT signal is established across the output terminals 24 and 26. The output voltage VOUT includes two single-ended output voltages VOUTP and VOUTN applied on output terminals 24 and 26, respectively. The operational amplifier 200, as shown in FIG. 1, comprises an input stage 100 consisting of a P-channel input section 110 and an N-channel input section 120.\n\nThe P-channel input section 110 comprises three P-channel MOS field effect transistors (hereinafter, referred to as PMOS transistors) M100, M101 and M102 constituting a differential amplifier. The PMOS transistor M100 acts as a bias current source for the input PMOS transistors M101 and M102. A positive differential input terminal 10 is connected to a gate of the PMOS transistor M101 for receiving a corresponding input voltage VINP. A negative differential input terminal 12 is connected to a gate of the PMOS transistor M102 for receiving a corresponding input voltage VINN. Sources of the transistors M101 and M102 are connected together to form a common source node N1 that is coupled to the current source. A source of the PMOS transistor M100 is connected to a power supply voltage VDD and a drain thereof is coupled to the common source node N1. Moreover, a gate of the transistor M100 receives a bias voltage BIAS1 through a terminal 14 from a bias circuit 170.\n\nThe N-channel input section 120 is comprised of three N-channel MOS field effect transistors (hereinafter, referred to as NMOS transistors) M103, M104 and M105 constituting a differential amplifier. The NMOS transistor M105 acts as a bias current source for the input NMOS transistors M103 and M104. Gates of the transistors M103 and M104 are connected to the positive and negative differential input terminals 10 and 12, respectively. Sources of the transistors M103 and M104 are commonly coupled to a drain of the transistor M105. A source of the transistor M105 is connected to a ground voltage VSS. The gate of NMOS transistor M105 receives a bias voltage BIAS4 through a terminal 20.\n\nAs shown in FIG. 1, the operational amplifier 200 further includes a folded cascode gain stage 130 composed of a cascode current mirror section 140 having four PMOS transistors M106 to M109 and a cascode current source section 150 having four NMOS transistors M110 to M113. The cascode current mirror 140 comprises two current sources. One of the two current sources is comprised of the transistors M106 and M108 and is connected to the output terminal 24. The other is comprised of the transistors M107 and M109 and is coupled to the output terminal 26. The current sources connected to the terminals 24 and 26 are comprised as mirrors of the input section biasing current source. Current paths of the transistors M106 and M108 are formed in series between the power supply voltage VDD and the output terminal 24. A gate of the transistor M106 is connected to a terminal 14 for receiving a bias voltage BIAS1 from the bias circuit 170, and a gate of the transistor M108 receives a bias voltage BIAS2 from a terminal 16. Current paths of the transistors M107 and M109 are formed in series between both the power supply voltage VDD and the output terminal 26 and their gates are connected to the terminals 14 and 16 in that order. A node T2 between the transistors M107 and M109 is connected to a drain of the NMOS transistor M103, and a node T1 between the transistors M106 and M108 is connected to a drain of the NMOS transistor M104.\n\nThe cascode current source section 150 comprises two current sources. As illustrated in FIG. 1, one of the two current sources is composed of two NMOS transistors M110 and M112 and the other is composed of two NMOS transistors M1 and M113. The one current source is coupled to the output terminal 24 and the other current source is coupled to the output terminal 26. The transistor M110 (a gate of which receives a bias voltage BIAS3 from a terminal 18) has a drain connected to the output terminal 24 and the transistor M112 (a gate of which receives a voltage VCM from a common mode feedback section 160) has a source connected to the ground voltage VSS. A node T3 between the transistor M110 and the transistor M112 is coupled to the common source node N1 through the transistor M102 of the P-channel input section 110. Current paths of the transistors M111 and M113 are formed in series between the output terminal 26 and the ground voltage VSS. A gate of the transistor M111 receives the bias voltage BIAS3, and a gate of the transistor M113 receives a common mode voltage VCM from the common mode feedback section 160. A node T4 between the transistor M1 and the transistor M113 is connected to the common source node N1 through the transistor M110 of the P-channel input section 110. The drains of PMOS transistors M101 and M102 of the P-channel input section 110 serve as a differential output pair. The nodes T3 and T4 of the cascode current source section 150 being connected to the drains of the PMOS transistors M101 and M102, respectively, serve as a differential input pair. Similarly, the drains of the NMOS transistors M103 and M104 serve as a differential input pair, and the nodes T1 and T2 of the cascode current mirror section 140 which are coupled to the drains of the NMOS transistors M103 and M104, respectively, serve as a differential output pair.\n\nThe N-channel input section 120 is an N-channel version of the P-channel input section 110, as is known in the art of analog design. Alternatively, the N-channel input section can be used and the P-channel input section can be omitted. However, the use of both the P-channel input section 110 and the N-channel input section 120 is preferred because it allows the input signal VIN to extend over the entire voltage range of the power supply. The elimination of one of the input sections simply reduces the input voltage range by a transistor threshold voltage.\n\nReferring still to FIG. 1, the bias circuit 170 generates the bias voltages BIAS1, BIAS2, BIAS3, BIAS4 and BIAS5 at levels corresponding to a normal mode of operation when a clock signal CLK is activated at a logic high level (e.g., the power supply voltage VDD). The bias circuit 170 is comprised of seven PMOS transistors M15, M17, M19, M21, M23, M24 and M26, five NMOS transistors M16, M18, M20, M22 and M25, one switch element SW1 controlled by the clock signal CLK and a current source I.sub.BIAS connected as illustrated in FIG. 1B.\n\nWith the circuit configuration as mentioned above in FIG. 1, the operational amplifier 200 is operated during one half cycle of the clock signal CLK and cannot be operated during the other half cycle of the clock signal CLK. Therefore, if there is no current supplied through the PMOS transistor M21, the power consumed by the operational amplifier is reduced by about 50%. Because the PMOS transistor M21 is turned on during the other half cycle of the clock signal CLK and a predetermined amount of current is supplied into the stages 100 and 130, the power saving ratio of the operational amplifier 200 is slightly reduced. This enables the operational amplifier 200 to be operated during a half cycle of the clock signal CLK and conserve power.\n\nReferring now to FIG. 2, there is a circuit diagram showing a fully differential folded cascode CMOS operational amplifier 200' having a common mode feedback section 160 and a bias circuit 170' according to a second preferred embodiment of the present invention. In FIG. 2, the constituent elements that are identical to those in the first embodiment of FIG. 1 are labeled with the same reference numerals. The input stage 100 and the folded cascode gain stage 130 of this embodiment differ from those of FIG. 1 only in that the bias voltage BIAS1 which is supplied to gates of the PMOS transistors M100, M106 and M107 in FIG. 1 is separated into two bias voltages BIAS1 and BIAS6.\n\nThe fully differential folded cascode CMOS operational amplifier 200' shown in FIG. 2 has a dominant pole ω.sub.p1 at an output stage, and has a second pole ω.sub.p2 equal to or approximately equal to the dominant pole at terminals T1, T2, T3 and T4. Because the hole mobility of a PMOS transistor is less than that of an NMOS transistor as well-known to those skilled in the art, a channel width-to-length ratio of the PMOS transistor may be at least twice as large as that of the NMOS transistor. The pole at the terminals T1 and T2 (which have a parasitic capacitance more than that of the terminals T3 and T4) may affect the operation of the operational amplifier. Therefore, considering mainly the pole at the terminals T1 and T2, a phase margin Φ.sub.PM for the unit gain frequency can be expressed as follows: ##EQU1## where g.sub.mn is an input transconductance value corresponding to the sum of transconductances of the P- and N-channel input sections 110 and 120, g.sub.mp is a transconductance value of the PMOS transistor M109 of the cascode current mirror section 140, C.sub.L represents a load capacitance value of the output stage and C.sub.P represents a parasitic capacitance at the terminal T2. In order to obtain a stabilized output voltage VOUT signal, the phase margin Φ.sub.PM of the output stage of the fully differential folded cascode CMOS operational amplifier 200 should be improved. In the equation, it is important that the g.sub.mn value always be maintained less than the g.sub.mp value.\n\nReferring again to FIG. 2, a preferred bias circuit 170' includes nine PMOS transistors M114, M116, M118, M120, M122, M124A, M124B, M126 and M128, seven NMOS transistors M115, M117, M119, M121, M123, M125 and M127, one switch element SW2 controlled by the clock signal CLK and a current source I.sub.BIAS. The current paths of the PMOS transistor M114 and the NMOS transistor M115 are formed in series between the power supply voltage VDD and the ground voltage VSS. A gate of the NMOS transistor M115 is connected to a terminal 32 for outputting a bias voltage (or, a bias current) BIAS5. The bias voltage BIAS5 is supplied to the common mode feedback section 160. The PMOS transistor M116 has a gate which is connected to its drain and a source which is coupled to the power supply voltage VDD. The drain of PMOS transistor M116 is also connected to the terminal 34 for outputting the bias voltage (or, a bias current) BIAS6, which is supplied to the gate of the PMOS transistor M100 in FIG. 2. Gates of the PMOS transistors M118 and M120 are coupled together and to a drain of the PMOS transistor M120. The PMOS transistor M118 has a current path formed between the power supply voltage VDD and the ground voltage VSS through the NMOS transistor M119. A gate of the NMOS transistor M119 is connected together to both a drain thereof and a terminal 36 for outputting a bias voltage BIAS4. The bias voltage BIAS4 is supplied to the gate of the NMOS transistor M105 in the N-channel input section 120. The NMOS transistor M117 has a gate connected to the gate of the NMOS transistor M119 and a current path formed between both the terminal 34 (i.e., the drain of the PMOS transistor M116) and the ground voltage VSS. Moreover, a current path of the PMOS transistor M120 is formed between the power supply voltage VDD and the terminal 28.\n\nDuring an operation of the bias circuit 170', the PMOS transistors M118 and M120 form a current mirror and also the NMOS transistors M117 and M119 form a current mirror. A current mirror is a circuit in which an output current is forced to be equal to an input current. Accordingly, in the current mirror, the output current is a mirror image of the input current.\n\nSources of the PMOS transistors M122, M124A, M124B, M126 and M128 are coupled together and to the power supply voltage VDD and gates thereof are connected commonly to a drain of the PMOS transistor M128. The drain of the PMOS transistor M128 is connected to the ground voltage VSS through the current source I.sub.BIAS. A gate and a drain of the PMOS transistor M122 are connected together to the terminal 30 for outputting a bias voltage BIAS2. The bias voltage BIAS2 is supplied to the gates of the PMOS transistors M108 and M109 in the cascode current mirror section 140. Drains of the NMOS transistors M121, M123 and M125 are connected to drains of corresponding PMOS transistors M120, M122 and M124A, respectively. The sources of NMOS transistors M121, M123 and M125 are connected to the ground voltage VSS and their gates are connected together and to the drain of the NMOS transistor M125. The PMOS transistor M124B has a drain connected to the drain of the NMOS transistor M125 through the switch element SW2, which is switched on/off by a clock signal CLK. Furthermore, the drains of the PMOS transistor M126 and the NMOS transistor M127 are connected together and to a terminal 38 for outputting a bias voltage BIAS3 which is supplied to the gates of the NMOS transistors M110 and M111. The NMOS transistor M127 has a source connected to the ground voltage VSS and a gate connected to the drain thereof. During operation (when the switch element SW2 is switched on by the clock signal CLK) the PMOS transistors M122, M124A, M124B, M126 and M128 and the NMOS transistors M121, M123 and M125 form current mirrors, as described above.\n\nWith the circuit configuration as shown in FIG. 2, the bias circuit 170' generates the bias voltages BIAS1 to BIAS6 when the clock signal CLK is changed from a logic low state (e.g., the ground voltage level VSS) to a logic high state (e.g., the power supply voltage VDD), so that the differential input stage 100 and the folded cascode gain stage 130 may operate normally during one half of a clock cycle (hereinafter, referred to as a normal mode of operation). On the contrary, the bias circuit 170' is inactivated when the clock signal CLK is changed from the logic high state to the logic low state, so that the differential input stage 100 and the folded cascode gain stage 130 do not operate normally during the other half of the clock cycle (hereinafter referred to as a power saving mode of operation). In a case where the operational amplifier 200 or 200' is used in a very large integrated circuit system using the clock signal CLK, bias currents from the bias circuit 170 and 170' are cut-off during one half cycle of the clock signal and are turned on during the other half cycle of the clock signal. Therefore, the operational amplifiers 200 and 200' according to the first and second embodiments consume less power.\n\nIf the bias voltages BIAS3 and BIAS4 are generated prior to the bias voltages BIAS1 and BIAS2 when a mode of the operational amplifier 200 or 200' is changed from the power saving mode of operation to the normal mode of operation, the transconductance g.sub.mn of the input stage 100 becomes more than the transconductance g.sub.mp of the PMOS transistor M109. As illustrated by the above equation, the phase margin (DPM at the output stage of the operational amplifier 200' may deteriorate as the transconductance of the input stage 100 is increased. Such an increase may also make the settling time at the output longer and result in the generation of an unstable output voltage VOUT signal. To limit instability and improve settling time, the g.sub.mn value should be maintained at a lower value than the g.sub.mp value.\n\nHowever, when the clock signal CLK is changed from the logic low state to the logic high state, the bias circuit 170' generates the bias voltages BIAS1 and BIAS2 and then generates the bias voltages BIAS3 and BIAS4, so that the cascode current mirror section 140 is first enabled and then the differential input stage 100 is enabled. Accordingly, the phase margin Φ.sub.PM may be improved (as shown by the above equation) by enlarging the transconductance g.sub.mp prior to the transconductance g.sub.mn. By using this preferred sequential biasing scheme, the pole ω.sub.p2 is pushed to a higher frequency than ω.sub.unity and the phase margin is thereby reduced. This results in a more stable output voltage VOUT signal when the mode of the operational amplifier 200 is in the power saving mode.\n\nIf bias currents (or, bias voltages) supplied from the bias circuit 170' in FIG. 2 are cut off entirely during the power saving mode of operation, it may be difficult to gain rapid operating speed when the mode of the operational amplifier 200 is converted from the power saving mode of operation to the normal mode of operation. However, by enabling a predetermined current to be supplied into the differential input stage 100 and the folded cascode gain stage 130 through the PMOS transistor M124A (which is always turned on regardless of the mode of operation of the operation amplifier 200'), the fully differential folded cascode CMOS operational amplifier 200' can also operate at high speed at the mode conversion time. Here, the bias voltages BIAS3 and BIAS5 are each supplied to the cascode current source section 150 and the common mode feedback section 160 regardless of the mode of operation of the operational amplifier 200', but the generation of these voltages does not significantly impact the overall power consumption of the operational amplifier 200'.\n\nReferring to FIG. 3, a schematic diagram of a sample and hold circuit 300 is shown. This circuit 300 includes a fully differential folded cascode CMOS operational amplifier 200' having a common mode feedback section 160 and the bias circuit 170' illustrated by FIG. 2. Here, the output signal waveform of the sample and hold circuit 300 is depicted in FIG. 4. In FIG. 4, the dotted line L1 represents the output signal waveform during mode conversion when g.sub.mn is greater than g.sub.mp and the solid line L2 represents the output signal waveform when g.sub.mn is less than g.sub.mp. As illustrated by line L1, the output signal overshoots and the settling time is relatively long. However, as illustrated by line L2, the output signal does not overshoot and the settling time is relatively short.\n\nWhen the ratios of the amount of current flowing through the PMOS transistor M124A to the amount of current flowing through the PMOS transistor M124B are changed according to the following ratios 0:120, 40:80, 100:20 and 120:0 during the power saving mode of operation, the output signal waveforms of the sample and hold circuit 300 are as illustrated by FIG. 5. The current ratio of the PMOS transistor M124A should be changed to reduce overall power consumption, but in system applications necessitating a high slew rate of output voltage, such as a high speed image processing system, the ratio should be optimized. A diagram showing the overall power consumption of the sample and hold circuit 300 according to the current ratio is illustrated in FIG. 6. FIG. 6 is depicted as normalized to `1` (a case that the sample and hold circuit 300 operates under the normal mode of operation in which the largest power of 10 mW is consumed). FIG. 7 shows a settling time of the output voltage signal from FIG. 3 according to the current ratios. As illustrated in FIG. 6, as the current is reduced, the settling time is increased. On the contrary, it can be known that an overall power consumption of the sample and hold circuit is reduced by 42%.BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS\n\nFIGS. 1A and 1B are an electrical schematic of a fully differential folded cascode CMOS operational amplifier according to a first embodiment of the present invention.\n\nFIGS. 2A and 2B are an electrical schematic of a fully differential folded cascode CMOS operational amplifier according to a second embodiment of the present invention.\n\nFIG. 3 is an electrical schematic of a sample and hold circuit which includes the operational amplifier of FIG. 2.\n\nFIG. 4 is a graph of output signal waveforms for the sample and hold circuit of FIG. 3 at various transconductance ratios.\n\nFIG. 5 is a graph of output signal waveforms for the sample and hold circuit of FIG. 3 at various current ratios.\n\nFIG. 6 is a graph which illustrates normalized power consumption requirements of the sample and hold circuit of FIG. 3 versus current ratio.\n\nFIG. 7 is a graph which illustrates settling time of the output signal of FIG. 3 versus current ratio.\n\nThe rapidly increasing complexity of functions performed by integrated circuits has resulted in a need to implement complete analog-digital subsystems on a single integrated circuit substrate. For this reason, implementation of certain analog functions in Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor (\"MOS\") technology has become increasingly important. Because operational amplifiers are key elements to most analog subsystems, such as switched capacitor filters or analog-to-digital (A/D) converters, performance of such analog-digital subsystems is strongly influenced by operational amplifier characteristics.\n\nIn designing an operational amplifier, it is important to consider various advantages and drawbacks associated with each of the amplifier configurations such as common emitter (\"CE\"), common base (\"CB\") and common collector (\"CC\"). For instance, a specific property of an amplifier configuration can be enhanced, a certain deficiency can be remedied and/or a special feature can be added by combining two configurations together (e.g., CC-CC, CC-CE, CC-CB, CE-CE and CE-CB).\n\nThe CE-CB configuration, usually referred to as a cascode amplifier, has basically the same input characteristics as the CE amplifier and the same output characteristics as the CB amplifier. In particular, the cascode amplifier has high output resistance which can be useful in achieving a large amount of voltage gain. High frequency feedback is also limited and the Miller capacitance is reduced because the voltage gain of the CE configuration is very low. Therefore, the CE-CB (or cascode) configuration is inherently stable and well suited for high-frequency applications.\n\nIn a system comprising an analog integrated circuit or a very large mixed-mode integrated circuit consisting of analog and digital integrated circuits, one of the integrated circuits consuming a relatively large amount of power may be the operational amplifier. Accordingly, to implement a low power system, it is important to design operational amplifiers which have reduced power consumption requirements\n\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\nIt is therefore an object of the present invention to provide improved operational amplifier integrated circuits.\n\nIt is another object of the present invention to provide operational amplifier integrated circuits having reduced power consumption requirements.\n\nIt is still another object of the present invention to provide operational amplifier integrated circuits having improved phase margin characteristics.\n\nThese and other objects, features and advantages of the present invention are provided by operational amplifier integrated circuits which compriseMoreover, according to a preferred aspect of one embodiment of the present invention, the cascode current mirror is electrically coupled to the differential input stage and also between a differential output and a first reference potential (e.g., Vdd). The cascode current source is also preferably electrically coupled to the differential input stage and between the differential output and a second reference potential (Vss). In addition, the differential input stage comprises first and second differential amplifiers.

The Food Project provides participants with everything they need to get started – including multiple raised garden beds, soil, seeds, transplants, a growing guide, on-site workshops, and assistance throughout the planning and implementation stages of the project. Through this volunteer-fueled initiative, the organization hopes to create a thoughtful and productive community of people from diverse backgrounds who work together to build a sustainable food system.\n\nIn this instance, two local businesses came together to support each other and the community, and the positive effects promise to be long-lasting. Heyes provided product made from a natural, renewable resource that will be used to help residents of Boston and Lynn grow a variety of wholesome, fresh produce at a fraction of the cost. Likewise, The Food Project's patronage of Heyes helps sustain local forest-based businesses that maintain healthy, working forests to create products that are important to us in everyday life. The end result is a mutually beneficial collaboration involving local products that will have a positive impact on local business, our community and the environment.\n\nIn what has become an annual tradition, Heyes supplied CQP-certified Massachusetts white pine lumber for The Food Project's \"Build-a-Garden\" program, which provides Boston-area residents the opportunity to grow their own food successfully and safely in urban neighborhoods through raised bed and container gardening.

Boutique hotels are a lot different from chain hotels, in design, service, ownership and most of all, philosophy. They are operated by individuals or companies with a small collection and usually don't have a large number of rooms. It depends on the location but the number is between a few and 150. Just enough to be unique and create a connection between customers and hotel staff.\n\nHotel Sezz, Paris\n\nDesign is the first and most important determinant when we are talking about boutique hotels. Most attention goes to interior design; furnished in a period style or modern, with different accents. Sometimes every room in a hotel is furnished differently to give a unique look and feel for every guest. It also happens that a particular hotel guest books the same room every time. Except styles, artwork and popular designer pieces, usually 20th century design, makes them so appealing. That's where the term design hotels derived from and became more used than boutique hotels.\n\nThe George Hotel, Hamburg\n\nThey are not only a fancy place to stay in, they have a deeper meaning. Every place, that being a vibrant city hotel or a small resort, is a cultural reflection. As art and architecture, people are trying to distinguish themselves through designing new places; hotels, bars, restaurants and shops. So each of them has a story to tell, a story told in their own, unique way.", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "b25c28c4-1580-4f94-a903-190a648b3c62", "url": "http://europeantravellingadvisor.wordpress.com/2008/12/01/boutique-hotels/"}

{"text": "Yeah, but they don't lie all the time. Mostly when they missed something, and someone else finds it in their data, or do a piss poor job smudging photo's. They collect more data than they have manpower to proof read.\n\nNASA is walking behind the facts en they deliberately let us walk behind them, so everything what comes to the attention of NASA will come to our attention some times later.\n\nNASA is a government company and every press release they make must be approved on forehand by higher hand (white house), so you can be certain that lots of discovery's are not shared with the public and apparently never will.\n\nTake the discovery of water for example. The Asians found that proof before NASA did, but NASA takes the honour and then share their information with the public. (Apparently not all of it of course)\n\nSo the only countries we can truly benefit from is Japan, China and India, because as far as I know, the indeed share their information after they checked it.\n\nSo to get back on topic, this information shared with the public is true and this will happen before the end of the year.\n\nWe will find the second Earth this year and when we do it will be a great discovery for mankind.\n\nWe will find the second Earth this year and when we do it will be a great discovery for mankind.\n\n? why should that be a great discovery for mankind?\n\nOutside our solar system, there is more than only one planet like the earth !\n\nOnly the concept of a \"Twin Earth\" makes it somewhat mysterious.\n\nBut this is rubbish - what do you mean please all \"Twin Earth\"? --- The better our instruments are more planets are found. This has nothing to do with a great discovery for mankind to ...\n\nOke that's your opinion maybe and you and I know there are other \"Earths\" out there, but our instruments haven't found them yet!\n\nKepler has a great change of finding a second Earth and with a second Earth I mean a planet similar to ours, with oxygen levels similar to here on Earth, which means life is to be found on that planet and we have the evidence to proof E.T.\n\nLots and lots of scientists, officials and people still do not believe there might be similar life out there.\n\nIn that way I find it a great discovery.\n\nTo find a similar Earth outside our solar system seems logical to me, because we explored almost all of our solar system already and there is no other planet orbiting in the habitable zone so there is no other planet in our solar system which is similar to Earth.\n\nI do not understand your simplicity?\n\nWe found 400 Exo planets already, but none of them is similar to Earth, so we still don't have the evidence, now do we?\n\nThe only thing I could not understand was, how could one predict the future so exactly saying 'by the end of the year'? Can you say: 'By the end of the year I shall discover a pot of gold in the Mediterranean ?' So sure? Have they already some hints? Have the chemicals been put together and the result will show by the yearend? or, is it yet another 'disclosure' that happened perhaps in november 2009...\n\nOh, now I understand you - your argument is false My argument is absolutely not false, why are you saying that?\n\nYou are looking for evidence of extraterrestrial life - but you only want to search for life on Earth-like planets? I am not looking, the scientists are and they find it most logical to find E.T. in the habitable zone near a similar size Sun as ours.\n\nAnd that also sounds logical to me. Not saying that there is no possibility of other life forms in other areas. The moon Europa for instance may host life beneath its surface, but that would not be life as we no it here on Earth.\n\nI think this is wrong. One again. You're allowed to have you own opinion.\n\nIf the planet orbits in the habitable zone around its sun, it only plays a minor role, the size of the planet or its sun. I do not understand what you are questioning if you are asking me!\n\nThe conditions to find a similar Earth as ours (First of all Earth is just the name we gave it) must be exact the same AS ours as we can see it from science point of view.\n\nSo I think the term Twin Earth, misleading. No not misleading at all. We are exploring space for a planet on which the conditions are exactly the same as here on Earth. When life is found in other conditions then we cannot speak of a twin Earth and that's what this article is about.\n\nIs not our Mars, Venus and our moon habitable? No they are not, only Earth is in the habitable zone. You can look it up if you want, otherwise I can provide you that evidence.\n\nSince the planet hunters can put their blinders on even closer I cannot agree to say Kepler is a blinder, but apparently I miss understood.\n\nSo to find E.T (Second E.T already found us) for us it is the best thing to look for a similar planet like ours; Earth", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "d194ed7d-87aa-4fbb-b30d-469ad77ea697", "url": "http://www.disclose.tv/forum/earth-s-twin-planet-will-be-found-by-the-end-of-the-year-t15050-10.html"}

{"text": "The Three Goodbyes...\n\nThe Three Goodbyes\n\nWith proper planning and support, caregivers can reduce some of the burdens associated with late-stage Alzheimer's.\n\nThe middle goodbye can be the hardest for caregivers to bear.\n\nWe all know we'll face the loss of loved ones in life. That hard truth is difficult enough to accept. Alzheimer's disease, however, adds an especially cruel twist to that expectation, says Valerie Wilson, MD, a geriatrician with Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center's Sticht Center on Aging. \"Alzheimer's is one of the most difficult diseases for caregivers because, in a sense, it causes you to have to say goodbye to your loved more than once,\" she says. \"You lose them when you get that diagnosis of a terminal illness. Then, as the disease progresses, you lose them again when they no longer recognize you. And, you lose them a third time when they actually pass away.\"\n\nIt's that middle goodbye, the one where you become a stranger to your loved one, that's usually the hardest for caregivers to bear. It's also a sign that the disease is entering its final phase—one that comes with a litany of exhausting and challenging demands.\n\nIdentifying Late-Stage Alzheimer's Disease Because diagnostic tools have improved over the years, Alzheimer's is increasingly diagnosed when a person is still in the early stages of the disease. This means many people can live with Alzheimer's for a number of years after diagnosis—although the rate of progression is highly variable.\n\n\"Alzheimer's tends to progress slower in the beginning stages and in the end stages,\" says Dr. Wilson, who is involved in memory assessment at the Sticht Center. \"The middle stages go by a bit faster. Data shows us the life expectancy after diagnosis can be anywhere from five to 18 years. Because it varies so much from person to person, the end stages of Alzheimer's can last for a couple of months or a few years.\"\n\nIn the final stages of Alzheimer's disease a person will decline even more severely, becoming unable to carry on a conversation or control movements, such as sitting without support or even smiling. The person's reflexes, muscle quality and ability to swallow may all become impaired.\n\n\"As a person enters the later stages of the disease, the caregiver really does struggle,\" says Dr. Wilson. \"There are physical strains that come with having to lift and dress your loved one, but the emotional stresses can be much harder than the physical ones.\"\n\nDr. Wilson offers the following suggestions on approaching the final phase of your loved one's disease:\n\nPrepare as early as possible.\n\nFriends and family can provide the emotional support you need during times of grief.\n\nIt's ideal to start making preparations for the final stages of Alzheimer's while your loved one is still in the early stages of the disease. Regardless of the current stage, however, it's important that you act right away. \"Whenever I assess a new patient of any stage, I recommend the family get advanced directives in place—specifically, a living will and healthcare power of attorney,\" says Dr. Wilson. \"To have these tasks and other end-of-life issues addressed beforehand takes a tremendous amount of stress and pressure off the caregiver.\"\n\nAsk for help and don't isolate yourself. Because people with late-stage Alzheimer's must be monitored and cared for 24 hours a day, seven days a week, caregivers face nearly impossible demands on their time and energy. Therefore, it's essential for you to seek help if you're caring for someone in the final stages of the disease. If you have the financial resources, or your loved one has long-term care insurance, contact a home health agency for assistance. If that's not an option, look to resources in your community that can either provide or direct you toward the help you need. These include local Alzheimer's organizations, city and county senior services, hospital-associated support groups, churches and temples, and nonprofits that address aging issues. In addition to caregiving help, there are also many groups that assist with food delivery, grocery shopping and housekeeping.\n\nDon't forget to ask friends and family for help. They, too, can lend a hand in many areas. Plus, they can provide you with added emotional support. \"It's very socially isolating to care for someone with dementia,\" says Dr. Wilson. \"And every caregiver should have some respite each day where he or she can have time to recuperate and refresh. Reaching out to family and friends can be one of the best things for you.\"\n\nConsider hospice care. Alzheimer's disease is a hospice-eligible diagnosis. As the disease advances and your loved one becomes less verbal, less mobile and eats less, it's an option you should consider looking into. Hospice is a way to provide your loved one with comfortable end-of-life care while also removing some of the immense strains you face as a caregiver.\n\nDon't take your loved one's symptoms personally. It's incredibly hurtful to not be recognized or remembered by your loved one. However, internalizing the experience can lead to more emotional pain. \"This is probably the hardest thing to deal with,\" says Dr. Wilson. \"Something that helps is to remember that this is just a symptom of a disease; it's nothing personal. We don't get our feelings hurt when people exhibit physical symptoms they can't control, so we should try to take the same approach to memory-related symptoms. Just because your mom or your dad doesn't recognize you at this moment doesn't mean they didn't love you more than the whole world when their brain was operating normally. You have to remember they can't control this symptom.\"\n\nAdjust medications. As a person with Alzheimer's moves into the final stages of the disease, it may be time to wean him or her off of some medications—with a doctor's guidance, of course. \"Once a person is in the advanced stages of dementia and has lost a lot of functioning, there's not always a whole lot left to preserve,\" says Dr. Wilson. \"Of course there are medications that can be used for symptom management, such as ones that help control agitation. These changes don't mean you're giving up on your loved one; they just mean you're meeting the needs of his or her disease stage.\"\n\nDeal with grief when it appears. Grief is a fact of life for Alzheimer's caregivers. Whether you're at your first, second or final goodbye, it's important to seek help in coping with it. Certified grief counselors are trained to help caregivers handle all forms of grief, including disease related emotional loss and anticipatory grief. Hospice provides grief-counseling services. If your loved one isn't currently in hospice, check with a local support group for a referral to a grief counselor. Your church or temple might also be a good place to go for help. ■ Continue", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "8d9dd776-b137-41ab-a4fb-f93cc72f1a19", "url": "http://www.alzinfo.org/06/pym/feature/the-three-goodbyes"}

Despite intense radiation near Io, the spacecraft completed all its planned activities during the flyby at 6:32 a.m. Pacific Standard Time on Tuesday, Feb. 22, at an altitude of 198 kilometers (124 miles).\n\nRelated Articles\n\nDespite intense radiation near Io, the spacecraft completed all its planned activities during the flyby at 6:32 a.m. Pacific Standard Time on Tuesday, Feb. 22, at an altitude of 198 kilometers (124 miles).\n\nData gathered during the flyby include observations designed to study changes in Io's volcanoes since Galileo's previous flybys of Io in October and November of 1999. There was also a radio science experiment performed while Jupiter was partly blocking the radio path from the spacecraft to Earth. By studying distortions in radio signals in these situations, scientists learn more about Jupiter's atmosphere.\n\nWhile Galileo was approaching Io, radiation did apparently trigger two computer resets, but previously-installed onboard software in essence told the spacecraft they were \"false alarms,\" and the flyby continued unaffected. The resets occurred on Feb. 22 at approximately 1:38 a.m. PST, and again sometime between 5:30 and 6:30 p.m.\n\nNearly two days after the close flyby, a third reset occurred on the spacecraft at 4:45 a.m. PST on Thursday, Feb. 24. This put the spacecraft in \"safing,\" or standby mode, which temporarily stopped all non-essential operations until further commands were received from Earth. Normally, that reset would have been handled by the same onboard software that took care of the first two resets. However, the third reset happened when the spacecraft had already completed its Io flyby and had begun playing back data from its onboard tape recorder. During playback, the software that would prevent safing is disabled. Once the flight team diagnosed the problem, normal operations were restored on the spacecraft later in the day, at 9:30 p.m. Playback of the Io data will resume on Saturday, Feb. 26.\n\nGalileo engineers were somewhat surprised that this third computer reset happened well after the Io flyby, when the spacecraft was quite a distance away from Jupiter (29 Jupiter radii, which is 2.1 million kilometers or 1.3 million miles) and therefore not as close to the most intense radiation. This served as another reminder of the powerful effects of natural radiation in space. Galileo has already survived more than twice the radiation it was designed to withstand, and its experiences will help mission planners design future spacecraft headed for high-radiation environments.\n\nGalileo was launched from the Space Shuttle Atlantis in 1989 and arrived in orbit around Jupiter in December 1995 for a two- year study of the huge planet, its moons, and its magnetic environment. That primary mission was completed successfully, and was followed by a two-year extension, which ended last month. Galileo is now embarking on another extension, called the Galileo Millennium Mission.\n\nNEW GALILEO VIEWS OF IO, EUROPA TO BE AVAILABLE ONLINE\n\nImages of two of Jupiter's moons -- Io and Europa -- taken by NASA's Galileo spacecraft during encounters late last year will be unveiled online Monday, March 6, at 9 a.m. Pacific Daylight Time at  .\n\nThese are the same images being released by the University of Arizona, Tucson, and they show volcanic features on Io and the side of Europa that faces Jupiter. Pictures from the more recent, closest-every flyby of Io on February 22 are currently being transmitted to Earth and will be processed and then released in the near future.\n\nGalileo has been orbiting Jupiter and its moons since December 1995. After its primary mission ended in December 1997, Galileo successfully completed a two-year extended mission, and it is currently embarking on another extension, called the Galileo Millennium Mission", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "d3579a8a-6292-4d94-827a-027fccf0c396", "url": "http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2000/03/000307092606.htm"}

{"text": "Computerized system to prevent SIDS developed by students\n\nA new system using video and computer software to monitor a baby that could be used to prevent Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS), as well as for telemedicine applications, has been developed by two students at Ben-Gurion University of the Negev (BGU).\n\nThe new system called \"BabyBeat\" was developed by students in the BGU Departments of Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences. It uses computer algorithms to convert video footage to pulses that represent a baby's heartbeat and skin tone. In the event that the system detects an abnormal heartbeat, an alarm sounds to awaken the baby, change its breathing pattern and alert the parents.\n\nSIDS is the unexpected, sudden death of a child under age one in which an autopsy does not show an explainable cause of death. No one knows what causes SIDS, but researchers have theorized that a dramatic drop in heart rate occurs just before death. Thousands of babies die from this phenomenon each year in the United States.\n\nTomer Apel and Anava Finesilver developed the program as part of their final research project. While still early in the development process, the software program will work with a basic video camera and home computer, which minimizes cost.\n\n\"Heart pulse affects the skin tone,\" Tomer Apel explains. \"This is such a minor change that it's not visible to the human eye, but it's still there. We have developed algorithms to interpret the discoloration recorded by the camera and translate them into pulses. It's widely assumed that baby's pulses slow down before SIDS, and this system could help prevent this.\"\n\nAfter further testing, if BabyBeat continues to perform as expected, the students will seek to commercially produce and market the innovation.\n\nThe system has other potential applications. It can monitor sleeping babies at daycare, as well as patients online in real time, providing for quality \"telemedicare\" when needed.\n\n\"BGU students were once referred to as 'Israel's oil wells that don't run dry' by New York Times columnist Thomas Friedman.

{"text": "Reflective practice\n\nReflective practice is \"the capacity to reflect on action so as to engage in a process of continuous learning\".[1] According to one definition it involves \"paying critical attention to the practical values and theories which inform everyday actions, by examining practice reflectively and reflexively. This leads to developmental insight\".[2]\n\nReflective practice can be an important tool in practice-based professional learning settings where individuals learning from their own professional experiences, rather than from formal teaching or knowledge transfer, may be the most important source of personal professional development and improvement. Further, it is also an important way to be able to bring together theory and practice; through reflection you are able to see and label schools of thought and theory within the context of your work.[3] What is important about reflection throughout your practice is that you are not just looking back on past actions and events, but rather you are taking a conscious look at the emotions, experiences, actions, and responses, and using that to add to your existing knowledge base to draw out new knowledge, meaning and have a higher level of understanding.[4] As such the notion has achieved wide take-up, particularly in professional development for practitioners in the areas of education and healthcare. The question of how best to learn from experience has wider relevance however, to any organizational learning environment. In particular, people in leadership positions have a tremendous development opportunity if they engage in reflective practice.\n\nReflective Practice was introduced by Donald Schön in his book The Reflective Practitioner in 1983, however, the concepts underlying reflective practice are much older. John Dewey was among the first to write about Reflective Practice with his exploration of experience, interaction and reflection.[5] Other researchers such as Kurt Lewin, Jean Piaget, William James and Carl Jung were developing theories of human learning and development.[6] Marcus Aurelius' Meditations has also been described as an example of reflective practice.[7]\n\nDewey's works inspired writers such as Donald Schön and David Boud to explore the boundaries of reflective practice. Central to the development of reflective theory was interest in the integration of theory and practice, the cyclic pattern of experience and the conscious application of that learning experience. For the last 30 years, there has been a growing literature and focus around experiential learning and the development and application of Reflective Practice. Reflective practice also contributes to learning and expressing our own and others' stories (Ivan, 2012).[full citation needed]\n\nDonald Schön's 1983 book introduces concepts such as 'reflection on action' and 'reflection in-action' where professionals meet the challenges of their work with a kind of improvisation learned in practice. Reflective Practice has now been widely accepted and used as developmental practices for organisations, networks, and individuals. As Boud et al state: \"Reflection is an important human activity in which people recapture their experience, think about it, mull it over and evaluate it. It is this working with experience that is important in learning.\"[8] Reflective Practice can be seen and has been recognised in many teaching and learning scenarios, and the emergence in more recent years of blogging has been seen as another form of reflection on experience in a technological age.[9]\n\nThe concept of Reflective Practice centers around the idea of lifelong learning in which a practitioner analyses experiences in order to learn from them. However it is important to note that events experience and events retold hold their own importance. When experiencing something (reflection-in-action), we are learning, however it can be difficult to put emotions, events, and thoughts into a coherent sequence of events. When retelling/rethinking about events we are better able to categorize events, emotions, idea, etc. and be able to link our intended purpose with the actions that we carried out. Only from here can we remove ourselves and your direct emotional attachment from an action, and look at it from a critical standpoint; when retelling it is as if we are taking ourselves out of the action and are telling a story of a sequence of events.[4] Reflective Practice is used to promote independent professionals who are continuously engaged in the reflection of situations they encounter in their professional worlds. Several models of reflection exist and are used to draw lessons out of experiences.[citation needed]\n\nAdaptation of the single and double loop learning model by Argyris and Schön\n\nAdaptation of the reflective model by Schön\n\nArgyris and Schön pioneered the idea of single loop and double loop learning in 1978. The theory was built around the recognition and amendment of a perceived fault or error.[10] Single loop learning is when a practitioner or organisation, even after an error has occurred and a correction is made, continues to rely on current strategies, techniques or policies when a situation again comes to light. Double loop learning involves the modification of personal objectives, strategies or policies so that when a similar situation arises a new framing system is employed.[11]\n\nBased on the works of John Dewey, Schön derives the notions of \"…reflection-on-action, reflection-in-action, responding to problematic situations, problem framing, problem solving, and the priority of practical knowledge over abstract theory…\" (2010, P. 311, Sharpiro).[full citation needed] Reflection-in-action can be described as the ability of a practitioner to 'think on their feet', otherwise known as 'felt-knowing'.[citation needed] It revolves around the idea that within any given moment, when faced with a professional issue, a practitioner usually connects with their feelings, emotions and prior experiences to attend to the situation directly. Reflection-on-action on the other hand is the idea that after the experience a practitioner analyses their reaction to the situation and explores the reasons around, and the consequences of, their actions. This is usually conducted through a documented reflection of the situation.[citation needed] However, this notion goes beyond just looking back on experiences and exploring the reasoning behind actions. Rather, it brings into action Schön's notion of \"…responding to problematic situations, problem framing, problem solving, and the priority of practical knowledge over abstract theory…\" (2010,Sharpiro, p. 311).[full citation needed] For Schön professional growth really begins when you start to view things with a critical lense, by doubting your actions. By creating doubt, it brings about a way of thinking that has you questioning and creating \"problems\" out of your actions. Then through careful planning and systematic elimination of other possible situations, doubt is settled, and you are able to affirm your knowledge of the situation; you are able to think about possible situations and their outcomes, and deliberate whether you carried out the right actions. In Schön terminology, you are framing your actions into problems (doubting your actions), you are then responding to the problematic situations (you are attending to the doubt that you have just created from your actions), and then you are looking at possible real world solutions that you could have undertaken to solve the problems/doubt that you created.\n\nKolb was highly influenced by the research conducted by Dewey and Piaget in the 1970s. Kolb's reflective model highlights the concept of experiential learning and is centered around the transformation of information into knowledge. This takes place after the situation has occurred and entails a practitioner reflecting on the experience, gaining a general understanding of the concepts encountered during the experience and then testing these general understandings on a new situation. In this way the knowledge that is gained from a situation is continuously applied and reapplied building on a practitioners prior experiences and knowledge.[12]\n\nGraham Gibbs discussed the use of structured debriefing to facilitate the reflection involved in Kolb's \"experiential learning cycle\". He presents the stages of a full structured debriefing as follows:\n\n\"What were your reactions and feelings? Again don't move on to analysing these yet.\"\n\nEvaluation:\n\n\"What was good or bad about the experience? Make value judgements.\"\n\nAnalysis:\n\n\"What sense can you make of the situation? Bring in ideas from outside the experience to help you.\"\n\n\"What was really going on?\"\n\n\"Were different people's experiences similar or different in important ways?\"\n\nConclusions (general):\n\n\"What can be concluded, in a general sense, from these experiences and the analyses you have undertaken?\"\n\nConclusions (specific):\n\n\"What can be concluded about your own specific, unique, personal situation or way of working?\"\n\nPersonal action plans:\n\n\"What are you going to do differently in this type of situation next time?\"\n\n\"What steps are you going to take on the basis of what you have learnt?\"[13][14]\n\nGibbs' suggestions are often cited as Gibbs' reflective cycle or Gibbs' model of reflection (1988), and simplified into the following six distinct stages:Therefore, offering constructive vital questions to assist in structuring reflection of learning experiences (Finlay, 2008).\n\nJohns' model is a structured mode of reflection that provides a practitioner with a guide to gain greater understanding. It is designed to be carried out through the act of sharing with a colleague or mentor, which enables the experience to become learnt knowledge at a faster rate than reflection alone.[15] Johns highlights the importance of experienced knowledge and the ability of a practitioner to access, understand and put into practice information that has been acquired through empirical means. In order for this to be achieved reflection occurs though 'looking in' on ones thoughts and emotions and 'looking out' at the situation experienced. Johns draws on the work of Carper (1978) to expand on the notion of 'looking out' at an experience.[16] Five patterns of knowing are incorporated into the guided reflection, having a practitioner analyse the aesthetic, personal, ethical, empirical and the reflexive elements experienced through the situation. Johns' model is comprehensive and allows for reflection that touches on many important elements.[17]\n\nCritically reflective practitioners constantly research their assumptions by seeing practice through four complementary lenses: the lens of their autobiography of learners of reflective practice, the lens of learners' eyes, the lens of colleagues' perception and the lens of theoretical, philosophical and research literature.[18] Reviewing practice through these lenses makes us more aware of the power dynamics that infuse all practice settings. It also helps us detect hegemonic assumptions - assumptions that we think are in our own best interests, but actually work against us in the long run (BROOKFIELD 1998). To become critically reflective, Brookfield thinks that the four lenses stated above will reflect back to us stark and differently highlighted pictures of who we are and what we do. Lens 1: Our autobiography as a learner is an important source of insight into practice. As we talk to each other about critical events in our practice, we start to realize that individual crises are usually collectively experienced dilemmas. Analysing our autobiographies allows us to draw insight and meanings for practice on a deep visceral emotional level. Lens 2: Our learners' eyes. Seeing ourselves through learners' eyes, we discover that learners are interpreting our actions in the way that we mean them. But often we are surprised by the diversity of meanings people read into our words and actions. A cardinal principle of seeing ourselves through learners' eyes is that of ensuring the anonymity of their critical opinions. You have to make students feel safe. Seeing our practice through learners' eyes helps us teach more responsively. Lens 3: Our colleagues' experiences. Our colleagues serve as critical mirrors reflecting back to us images of our actions. Talking to colleagues about problems and gaining their perspective increases our chance of finding some information that can help our situation. Lens 4: Theoretical literature. Theory can help us \"name\" our practice by illuminating the general elements of what we think are idiosyncratic experiences.\n\nRolfe's reflective model is based around Borton's 1970 developmental model.[19] A simplistic cycle composed of 3 questions which asks the practitioner, What, So What and Now What. Through this analysis a description of the situation is given which then leads into the scrutiny of the situation and the construction of knowledge that has been learnt through the experience. Subsequent to this, ways in which to personally improve and the consequence of ones response to the experience are reflected on.[20]\n\nBased on Schön's theory and writings of Otl Aicher,[21]Christian Gänshirt proposes the concept of the Design Cycle to describe the reflective and repetitive structure of design processes, assuming that this structure is underlying all such processes.[22] The Design Cycle is understood as a circular time structure,[23] which may start with the thinking of an idea, then expressing it by the use of visual and/or verbal means of communication (design tools), the sharing and perceiving of the expressed idea, and starting a new cycle with the critical rethinking of the perceived idea. Anderson points out that this concept emphasizes the importance of the means of expression, which at the same time are means of perception of any design ideas.[24] These means or design tools enable and structure the visual and verbal design thinking. Wortmann argues that Gänshirt's design cycle and Schön's reflection-in-action are descriptive models that integrate designing as a spontaneous act and designing as an explicit process.[25]\n\nReflective Practice has been described as an unstructured approach directing understanding and learning, a self regulated process, commonly used in health and teaching professions, though applicable to all professions.[26][27][28] Reflective practice is a learning process taught to professionals from a variety of disciplines by practitioners, with the aim of enhancing abilities to communicate and making informed/balanced decisions. The practice has historically been applied most in the educational and medical field. When reflection in action and reflection on action described by Donald Schon are utilized in practice and when practitioners are able to identify these actions they become better at reflective practice. Professional Colleges such as the College of Nurses and College of Dental Hygienists are recognizing the importance of reflective practice and require practitioners to prepare reflective portfolios as a requirement to be licensed, and for yearly quality assurance purposes.\n\nIn education, reflective practice refers to the process of the educator studying his or her own teaching methods and determining what works best for the students. It involves the consideration of the ethical consequences of classroom procedures on students.[27]\n\nThe appeal of the use of reflective practice for teachers is that as teaching and learning are complex, and there is not one right approach, reflecting on different versions of teaching, and reshaping past and current experiences will lead to improvement in teaching practices.[29] Schön's reflection-in-action assists teachers in making the professional knowledge that they will gain from their experience in the classroom an explicit part of their decision-making.[30]\n\nAccording to Paterson and Chapman (2013), reflection and learning from experience is key to staying accountable, and maintaining and developing aptitude throughout your practice. Without reflection you as a practitioner are not able to look objectively at your actions or take into account the emotions, experience, or responses from your actions to improve your practice. Through the process of reflection teachers are then held accountable to their teaching practice to students, parents, administration, and all interested state holders; to the standards of practice for teaching (in Ontario)- commitment to students and student learning, professional knowledge, professional practice, leadership in learning communities, and ongoing professional learning. Reflection is a vital process of learning from experience that allow you to evolve as a practitioner; through learning from past experiences, it allows you to develop a more through schema for practice.[4] Through reflective practice, you as a teacher are committing yourself to students and student learning; you are looking back on your practice and reflecting on how you have supported students through treating them \"…equitably and with respect and are sensitive to factors that influence individual student learning\" (2013, Ontario College of Teachers). By this, you are asking yourself, have I to the best of my abilities supported student learning, and provided all of my students with an entry point into learning. Through reflective practice you are reflecting on your professional knowledge and professional practice; you are looking at how you teach and the information and forms of learning you are bring to your students, and taking a critical look at whether or not you are current and if your ways of teaching are having an impact on student learning that they will be able to translate into future endeavors. If this is not the case you are then addressing the standard of ongoing professional learning. Here you are looking at and trying to recognize where you need to enhance your own learning so that it had a bigger benefit to student learning. In addition, teachers are the leaders in their learning communities; it is from their cues and attitudes that their learners develop from. Through reflection, and sharing this with your learner, you are showing strong leadership because it shows that you are willing to learn from your mistakes and improve your practice for all of those affected by it (2013, Ontario College of Teachers).\n\nAs Larrivee argues, Reflective Practice moves teachers from their knowledge base of distinct skills to a stage in their careers where they are able to modify their skills to suit specific contexts and situations, and eventually to invent new strategies.[27] In implementing a process of Reflective Practice teachers will be able to move themselves, and their schools, beyond existing theories in practice.[29] Larrivee concludes that teachers should \"resist establishing a classroom culture of control and become a reflective practitioner, continuously engaging in a critical reflection, consequently remaining fluid in the dynamic environment of the classroom\".[27]\n\nReflective Practice is associated with learning from experience, and is viewed as an important strategy for health professionals who embrace lifelong learning. Due to the ever changing context of healthcare and the continual growth of medical knowledge, there is a high level of demand on healthcare professionals' expertise.[31] Due to this complex and continually changing environment, healthcare professionals could benefit from a program of reflective practice.[32]\n\nPrice (2004[33]) recognizes that there are several reasons why a healthcare practitioner would engage in reflective practice: To further understand yourself, motives, perceptions, attitudes, values and feelings associated with client care; To provide a fresh outlook to practice situations and challenge existing thoughts, feelings as well as actions; To explore how the practice situation may be approached differently.\n\nIn the field of nursing there is concern that actions may run the risk of habitualisation, thus dehumanising patients and their needs.[34] In utilising Reflective Practice, nurses are able to plan their actions and consciously monitor the action to ensure it is beneficial to their patient.[34]\n\nThe act of reflection is seen as a way of promoting the development of autonomous, qualified and self-directed professionals. Engaging in Reflective Practice is associated with the improvement of the quality of care, stimulating personal and professional growth and closing the gap between theory and practice.[35] Activities to promote reflection are now being incorporated into undergraduate, postgrduate and continuing medical education across a variety of health professions[36] Mann (2009) found through her research that in practising professionals the process of reflection appears to be multifactorial and to include different aspects. In addition to reflection both on and during experiences that the anticipation of a challenging situation also stimulated reflection. Practicing professionals vary in their tendency and ability to reflect.\n\nDavies (2012[37]) identifies that there are both benefits as well as limitations to reflective practice:\n\nBenefits to Reflective Practice\n\nIncreased learning from an experience for situation\n\nPromotion of deep learning\n\nIdentification of personal and professional strengths and areas for improvement\n\nThere is some criticism that traditional environmental management which simply focuses on the problem at hand, fails to integrate the wider context in which the environment sits into the decision making.[38] While research and science must inform the process of environmental management, it is up to the practitioner to integrate those results within this wider context.[39] In order to deal with this and to reaffirm the utility of environmental management Bryant and Wilson propose that a \"more reflective approach is required that seeks to rethink the basic premises of environmental management as a process\".[38] This style of approach has been found to be successful in sustainable development projects where participants appreciated and enjoyed the educational aspect of utilising reflective practice throughout, however the authors noted the challenges with melding the \"circularity\" of reflective practice theory with the \"doing\" of sustainability.[40]\n\nReflective Practice provides a tremendous development opportunity for those in leadership positions. Managing a team of people requires a delicate balance between people skills and technical expertise, and success in this type of role does not come easily. Reflective Practice provides leaders with an opportunity to critically review what has been successful in the past and where improvement can be made. To support reflective learning organizations have invested in coaching programs for their emerging and established leaders.[41] Coaching is defined by the International Coaching Federation as partnering with clients in a thought provoking and creative process that inspires them to maximize their personal and professional potential.[42] Leaders frequently engage in self-limiting behaviours because of their over reliance on their preferred ways of reacting and responding.[43] To help support the establishment of new behaviours, coaching is extremely useful as it encourages reflection, critical thinking and transformative learning. Adults have acquired a body of experience throughout their life or frames of reference that define their world.[44] Coaching programs support the process of questioning and potentially rebuilding these pre-determined frames of reference. The goal is for a leader to maximize their professional potential and in order to do this, there must be a process of critical reflection on current assumptions.[45]\n\nReflective Practice can help an individual to develop personally, and is useful for professions other than those discussed above. It allows professionals to continually update their skills and knowledge and consider ways to interact with their colleagues.[46]", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "5cefea31-36ac-4f9e-a8b7-f5cab46ded61", "url": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflective_practice"}

{"text": "FRENCH INDOCHINA (Western Colonialism)\n\nIndochina is a French colony and four protectorates in Southeast Asia established between l860 and 1904, and covering the present-day territories of Cambodia, Vietnam, and Laos. The five colonial components of Indochina became independent in 1954.\n\nBEGINNINGS\n\nFrench imperialism in Southeast Asia began almost accidentally in 1858, when a French fleet bombarded the Vietnamese port of Tourane (present-day Danang) to avenge the execution of Catholic missionaries by the Vietnamese regime. Hoping to gain commercial advantages and military renown, French troops occupied the southern city of Saigon (present-day Ho Chi Minh City) in 1860 and by 1867 France had expanded its colony— which it named Cochinchine (Cochin China)—over six adjoining provinces. The Vietnamese emperor in Hue, who had been taken completely by surprise, acceded reluctantly to these developments, signing a treaty with France in 1862.\n\nIn 1863, in order to protect the western frontiers of Cochin China, the French imposed a protectorate on the kingdom of Cambodia. They did so with the consent of the Cambodian monarch, Norodom (r. 1863-1904), who feared that continuing pressure on his kingdom from Siam would jeopardize his freedom of maneuver. The French were drawn to Cambodia by illusory notions of commercial rewards that might accrue via the unmapped Mekong River. Because King Norodom acquiesced willingly to French protection and accepted what the French called their \"civilizing mission\" (mission civilisatrice), Cambodia soon became one of France's favorite possessions.\n\nBetween 1873 and 1885, the French expanded their empire by imposing separate protectorates over Annam (central Vietnam)—a region that included the imperial capital of Hue—and the northern provinces of Tonkin, where the important cities of Hanoi and Haiphong were located. France broke the Vietnamese empire, which had been unified by the Nguyen Emperor Gia Long (r. 1802-1820), into three pieces. Intentionally or not, they destroyed the old, Confucian-based administrative order, and created opportunities for the Vietnamese elite to imagine and devise new ways of governing their country. \"Vietnam,\" in any case, had disappeared and as late as the 1940s the French forbade local people to use the word.\n\nIn 1904 three principalities east of the Mekong and north of Cambodia that the French named Laos came under French control, following over twenty years of French pressure and diplomatic maneuvering. The Lao princes were happy to exchange the patronage of the Siamese ruler in Bangkok for open-ended, relatively genteel French protection.\n\nIn 1907 France persuaded Siam to relinquish control over two provinces in western Cambodia annexed by Siam in the 1790s. Following the transfer of these provinces, one of which contained the ruins of Cambodia's medieval capital of Angkor, French Indochina assumed the physical dimensions that it retained (save for a brief hiatus in World War II) until the end of the colonial era.\n\nCHARACTERISTICS OF INDOCHINA\n\nFrench policies and administrative styles differed over time and from place to place, responding in part to differences among the components of their empire. Cochin China was a colony and was subject to French law. Its French citizens elected a member to the National Assembly in Paris. The regime encouraged the Vietnamese elite to take up French citizenship. France used hundreds of local people in their administration, with a French governor as the supreme authority. The press was relatively free and people were better educated than elsewhere in Indochina. In the \"protectorates,\" where local rulers supposedly retained authority, French citizenship was harder to obtain, educational institutions developed more slowly, and French controls over the press and political activity were more repressive.\n\nThe component parts of Indochina also differed demographically: the Red River Delta in Tonkin, bordering China, was one of the most densely populated regions in the world, whereas Annam, Cambodia, and Laos housed relatively few people. The parts differed culturally as well, as the name Indochina suggests. The national languages of Laos, Cambodia, and Vietnam were mutually unintelligible. The Lao and Cambodians were Theravada Buddhists with cultures influenced indirectly by India, whereas the Vietnamese were nominally Mahayana Buddhists, and had been deeply influenced by Chinese Confucian culture and administration for over two thousand years. Eating habits, writing systems, clothing styles, and domestic architecture differed between Laos and Cambodia on the one hand and Vietnam on the other. Finally, largely because of nineteenth-century events, the Khmer and the Lao were fearful of Vietnamese expansion, whereas the Vietnamese, in general, looked down on their \"barbarian\" neighbors to the west.\n\nUnder the French Governor General Paul Doumer (1897-1902), administrative distinctions in the region blurred as the overarching entity of \"Indochina\" was imposed onto its component parts. Doumer's reforms brought Indochina's accounts into balance, via the efficient collection of taxes. Government monopolies on the sale of opium, salt, and alcohol provided almost half of the total revenues. Local people (including the Lao, after 1904) were also heavily taxed. They now came under the jurisdiction of a French Governor General, resident in Hanoi. The French maintained the fiction that they governed on behalf of local rulers (except in Cochin China), but gave those rulers no authority.\n\nECONOMICS AND ADMINISTRATION\n\nTo rule over millions of people, the French needed local help. In Vietnam they could count on experienced administrators to collect taxes and to maintain law and order. In Laos and Cambodia, a career civil service was undeveloped but taxes were collected with the help of local elites.\n\nIn economic terms, Cochin China was the most prosperous part of Indochina. The benefits of French law, combined with profitable rice and rubber plantations (the latter controlled by French companies) and the entrepreneurial energy of Chinese and Sino-Vietnamese merchants, made Cochin China the liveliest, most prosperous, and most Francophile component of Indochina. Hundreds of wealthy Cochin Chinese were educated in France, and immigrants from southern China poured into the colony, where most of them engaged in commerce and petty manufacturing. Saigon and its Chinese suburb of Cholon were linked by trading networks to the outside world and functioned as powerful engines of free market capitalism.\n\nBy the 1920s, rich coal deposits in Tonkin and rubber plantations in Cambodia also produced revenue for French investors and spawned the beginnings of a proletariat, later drawn toward the Indo-China Communist Party (or ICP; founded in 1930). Investments in Indochinese public works such as the Hanoi to Saigon railroad, which carried few passengers and very little freight, reaped large profits for shareholders in France, who constituted the Indochina lobby. At the same time, France was reluctant to encourage any manufacturing in Indochina that would compete with imported French goods. Local merchants grew rich in the import-export business and by buying up agricultural harvests, while local rice growers in Cambodia and the Mekong Delta (after the region had been drained by French engineers) became more prosperous as they expanded their subsistence-oriented holdings to produce crops for export. Marketing was assisted by a new network of roads, market towns, and railways in Vietnam and Cambodia. In the 1920s most of Indochina enjoyed an economic boom, spurred by international demands for rubber, rice, and other agricultural products.\n\nTHE MONOLOGUE OF COLONIALISM\n\nThe French expected to stay indefinitely in Indochina. In what the French scholar Paul Mus has called the \"monologue of colonialism,\" they made no sustained effort to prepare local people for self-sufficiency, higher education, free trade, relations with other countries, political participation, or independence. Unlike the British in India, the French had no exit strategy. The process of domination involved infantilizing their colonial proteges. Quarantined in theory (and by the French police) from politics and drastic change, local people were forbidden to grow up, meaning that the civilizing mission could never be complete. In fact, widespread modernization took place throughout Vietnam, especially among the expanding reading public, after the French introduced a Roman alphabet (quoc ngu) for writing Vietnamese, replacing the Chinese ideograms that had been in use for two millennia. Thousands of Vietnamese readers happily absorbed new nonpolitical publications (including women's magazines, self-help manuals, and technical handbooks) as well as new literary forms, such as daily newspapers and the novel. In Laos and Cambodia, where literacy was less widespread and less prestigious, the psychological effects of what Benedict Anderson has called print capitalism, and has linked to nationalism, were much slower. At the same time, roads and railroads, market towns, automobiles, movies and radio, telecommunications, the expansion of education, and the growth of cities—developments in which the French participated but could not control—took place alongside the ongoing political repression that kept local people in check and has preoccupied so many writers.\n\nFrench administrators—who enjoyed lower status at home than their British counterparts in India, and were more numerous—tried to preserve, as if in amber, supposedly \"traditional\" culture, class divisions, and patterns of land ownership. It was pleasing and inexpensive for them to do so. Traditional rulers had similarly sought to control and exploit local people, who had never had a voice in administration. In Cambodia, the French restored the medieval temple complex of Angkor and in effect presented the Khmer with the gift of a history that they had forgotten. The Vietnamese were less happy at being placed in a Confucian time warp, especially after Chinese elements of their culture and traditional government had been so severely undermined. The French made sure, in the meantime, that local people paid the costs of governing Indochina. Until the closing year of World War II, with rare exceptions, the system worked.\n\nRESISTANCE TO THE FRENCH\n\nResistance to the French in Vietnam began in the 1860s and continued sporadically until the 1930s, reemerging during World War II and reaching a climax in September 1945 when the Vietnamese Communist leader Ho Chi Minh (l890—1969) declared Vietnam's independence. There was much less resistance to France in Cambodia and Laos. Because of the intensity of resistance in Vietnam and the eventual victory of anticolonial forces there, it is tempting to read Vietnamese history in terms of continuous and eventually triumphant resistance to foreign control. Many scholars have chosen to do so. Vietnam's victories over France and the United States, following centuries of resistance to China in precolonial times, provide a pleasing structure for Vietnamese historical writing, from the winners' point of view.\n\nMore recently, scholars have argued that multiple readings of the Indochinese past are preferable to unilinear ones. The resistance model, for example, does not clarify the histories of Laos or Cambodia, nor does it explain the thirty-year-long alliance between southern Vietnam and the United States. Scholars have also drawn attention to the complex social history of the region, where developments occurred without reference to the political interplay between the French and the Vietnamese. Print capitalism has been mentioned. Scholars have also singled out the sizeable contributions made by such historical \"losers\" as nonrevolutionary women, Catholics, Francophiles, members of religious sects, ethnic minorities, and the southern Vietnamese allied with the United States.\n\nNonetheless, in an article of this length, resistance has to occupy a prominent position. Without it, after all, the French might have stayed on much longer, or might even still be in command.\n\nIn the 1880s the \"aid the king\" (can vuong) movement mobilized thousands of patriots who sought fruitlessly but with great courage to restore the status quo ante. They were crushed by French military force, but their patriotism inspired many later thinkers, including Ho Chi Minh.\n\nIn the early twentieth century, the prospects for turning the clock back dimmed. Vietnamese patriots like Phan Boi Chau (1867-1940) were impressed by developments in China and Japan, while opponents of France in the 1920s and 1930s, most notably Phan Chu Trinh (1871-1926), drew on European examples—including democracy and Communism—for their ideology. After 1900, few Vietnamese intellectuals sought refuge in the precolonial past.\n\nUntil the late 1940s, French repressive mechanisms in Indochina were sufficient to keep most resistance in check. When armed resistance broke out in 1930 to 1931 in northern and central Vietnam, partly in response to severe economic conditions, it was ruthlessly repressed. Hundreds of rebels were put to death. The ICP (founded by Ho Chi Minh) had been involved in the uprisings, and soon became the best organized of the clandestine groups opposed to French colonialism. As thousands of Vietnamese were arrested for political \"crimes,\" the prisons became training schools for anti-French political cadre, especially Communists, many of whom were released under France's Popular Front government (l936-1939).\n\nThe most substantial resistance to France in Cambodia came in 1884 to 1886, when the French tried to abolish what they called \"slavery\" in the kingdom. Their move struck at the networks of patronage and clientship that allowed Cambodia to function in a premodern fashion. The revolt forced the French to slow down the pace of reform. Until the l940s, Cambodia was at peace. Historians looking for the roots of Cambodian nationalism have found them in the small Cambodian elite educated in the 1930s, and in the Cambodian language newspaper Nagara Vatta (Angkor Wat), which flourished between 1936 and 1942. Resistance to the French in Laos was also insignificant because the Lao population was scattered and apolitical, while the relatively benign Lao elite remained in place, supported by the French.\n\nFRENCH INDOCHINA: THE FINAL PHASES\n\nWorld War II was a turning point in Indochina. When it began in 1939, France was more firmly in control than ever. Six years later, thanks to the Japanese, all the components of Indochina declared their independence, and France had to fight its way back into the region.\n\nFrance's defeat in Europe led Thailand (formerly known as Siam) to attack Cambodia and Laos so as to regain some of the territory that had been taken from it by France. In 1941 Japan reached an agreement with the French in Indochina whereby the Japanese stationed troops in the region while France retained administrative control. The arrangement suited both parties but displeased France's former European allies. Japan launched its invasion of the rest of mainland Southeast Asia from Indochinese bases in December 1941.\n\nBan Me Thoot, May 1950. General Jean de Lattre de Tassigny (right), commander of French troops in Indochina, and Bao Dai, the former emperor of Vietnam, visit in Ban Me Thoot with the Vietnamese Mois people, who were fghting the communist-dominated Vietminh forces.\n\nIn the same year, Ho Chi Minh returned to Vietnam after forty years in exile, and established the Viet Minh (\"Free Viet\") independence movement as a united front (secretly led by the ICP). He was joined in the mountains by new recruits and by members of the ICP. Nationalists in Cambodia and Laos, drawn from the educated elite, also accelerated their anti-French activities, encouraged by Japan and by the Thai, but armed resistance to France failed to develop before 1945.\n\nOn March 9, 1945, fearing an Allied attack, the Japanese moved suddenly to sequester French military and civilian officials throughout Indochina. The French were taken by surprise. The Japanese then urged local rulers, who had been handpicked by the French, to declare independence. For the next few months Cambodia and Laos governed themselves, Vietnam was briefly reunited, and the Viet Minh descended from their strongholds to take control over much of Tonkin. In September 1945 Bao Dai abdicated in favor of Ho Chi Minh, who proclaimed Vietnam's independence in Hanoi a day after Japan surrendered to the Allies.\n\nAfter the surrender, under agreements reached at Potsdam in June 1945, British troops were sent to disarm the Japanese in southern Indochina, while Chinese Nationalist troops performed the same task in the north. British support for French colonialism (opposed by the United States) meant that several hundred French troops were able to reenter Cochin China and reassert control there and in Cambodia. They were unable to do so in the north, where they were forced to negotiate with Ho Chi Minh's new national government, known as the Democratic Republic of Vietnam (RDVN). In November 1946 fighting broke out between French and RDVN forces, first in northern Vietnam and later throughout the country. By 1950 the Vietnamese Communists had also come to dominate the poorly organized Lao and Cambodian independence movements. After the Communist victory in China in 1949, Chinese aid helped the Viet Minh to defeat the French, and all of Indochina became independent in 1954. Vietnam, however, was divided at the seventeenth parallel, and an anticommunist regime in southern Vietnam held out against North Vietnamese military pressure with American assistance until l975, when RDVN forces occupied the south and reunited the country, which they renamed the Socialist Republic of Vietnam.\n\nA BALANCE SHEET\n\nHalf a century after the collapse of the French empire in Indochina, and nearly thirty years after the end of the second Indochina War, we can assess the colonial era more objectively than would have been possible in the 1940s and 1950s, when independence movements throughout Southeast Asia, supported by large sections of global public opinion, swept out their colonial masters. The historian Nicholas Tarling has called colonialism in Southeast Asia a \"fleeting, passing phase\" and certainly France's brief time in Indochina has to be weighed against the thousands of years that came before and the half-century that has elapsed since France departed from the region. It is tempting to say that the colonial era in Indochina was unimportant. Nonetheless, while it is possible to imagine Vietnam modernizing itself without the intrusion of a colonial power, it is unlikely that Laos and Cambodia would have survived as independent states without French protection against their Southeast Asian neighbors.\n\nA legacy of French town planning, official architecture, and design is still visible in Indochina, especially in the larger towns. Museums in Cambodia, Laos, and Vietnam were established by the French and flourish today, while in Cambodia the French still play an important role in the restoration and maintenance of Angkor. The major cities, especially Hanoi and Phnom Penh, still have a French \"feel\" about them, and whereas Vietnam and Laos now have Marxist-Leninist regimes, the government of Cambodia retains many organizational features inherited from the colonial era. Finally, while the many shortcomings of French rule must be firmly kept in mind, it is impossible to blame or praise the French for developments that have occurred in Indochina since the 1970s, after French influence had sharply diminished throughout the region.", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "4450f4a8-e05b-46e0-b9fc-73993820532f", "url": "http://what-when-how.com/western-colonialism/french-indochina-western-colonialism/"}

However, it can do something that other plants cannot do – as biologists at Bielefeld University have confirmed. Credit: Bielefeld University\n\nFlowers need water and light to grow. Even children learn that plants use sunlight to gather energy from earth and water. Members of Professor Dr. Olaf Kruse's biological research team at Bielefeld University have made a groundbreaking discovery that one plant has another way of doing this. They have confirmed for the first time that a plant, the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, not only engages in photosynthesis, but also has an alternative source of energy: it can draw it from other plants. This finding could also have a major impact on the future of bioenergy.\n\nThe research findings have been released on Tuesday 20 November in the online journal Nature Communications published by the renowned journal Nature. Credit: Bielefeld University\n\nUntil now, it was believed that only worms, bacteria, and fungi could digest vegetable cellulose and use it as a source of carbon for their growth and survival. Plants, in contrast, engage in the photosynthesis of carbon dioxide, water, and light. In a series of experiments, Professor Dr. Olaf Kruse and his team cultivated the microscopically small green alga species Chlamydomonas reinhardtii in a low carbon dioxide environment and observed that when faced with such a shortage, these single-cell plants can draw energy from neighbouring vegetable cellulose instead.\n\nThe alga secretes enzymes (so-called cellulose enzymes) that 'digest' the cellulose, breaking it down into smaller sugar components. These are then transported into the cells and transformed into a source of energy: the alga can continue to grow. 'This is the first time that such a behaviour has been confirmed in a vegetable organism', says Professor Kruse. 'That algae can digest cellulose contradicts every previous textbook. To a certain extent, what we are seeing is plants eating plants'. Currently, the scientists are studying whether this mechanism can also be found in other types of alga. Preliminary findings indicate that this is the case.\n\nCarbon dioxide and light: It is easy to grow algae in a bioreactor like that here at Bielefeld University. They then offer an alternative to the controversial use of land plants in bioenergy production. Credit: Bielefeld University\n\nIn the future, this 'new' property of algae could also be of interest for bioenergy production. Breaking down vegetable cellulose biologically is one of the most important tasks in this field. Although vast quantities of waste containing cellulose are available from, for example, field crops, it cannot be transformed into biofuels in this form. Cellulose enzymes first have to break down the material and process it. At present, the necessary cellulose enzymes are extracted from fungi that, in turn, require organic material in order to grow. If, in future, cellulose enzymes can be obtained from algae, there would be no more need for the organic material to feed the fungi. Then even when it is confirmed that algae can use alternative nutrients, water and light suffice for them to grow in normal conditions.\n\nFood versus fuel -- this rivalry is gaining significance against a backdrop of increasingly scarce farmland and a concurrent trend towards the use of bio-fuels.

{"text": "We Don't Need Learning Styles\n\nA MiddleWeb Blog\n\nSo where were you when you first heard the news that the theory of student learning styles doesn't hold up under scientific scrutiny?\n\nHeadlines such as Learning Styles Debunked and Learning Styles Re-evaluatedhit the educational scene back in 2009. I remember going from link to link while my thoughts ranged from intrigue to skepticism. I just couldn't wrap my mind around the attack on the learning style theory that I was trained to believe. Could it really be true that the theory I thought about every day as I considered the needs of my students was a fallacy?\n\nFor quite awhile I just couldn't buy into it. It wasn't until I began to read the work of cognitive psychologist Daniel Willingham that I started to make friends with the idea. And now, nearly five years later, after further study, research and new knowledge gained through my investigation of the Universal Design for Learning, I have put the pieces together.\n\nWith all due respect to the skeptics out there (I understand that many educators really \"own\" this idea), the learning style theory just doesn't play a major role in my thinking as a teacher anymore. Have I shocked anyone? Allow me to connect all the dots…\n\nPerspective shift\n\nAs far back as 2005, cognitive psychologist Dr. Daniel Willingham starting shaking the education tree with articles such as this one making the outrageous claim that learning styles simply do not exist. It caused some stir, but I remember most teachers I knew just blew it off as crazy. It wasn't until I watched this video clip in 2008 that I began to think, Hey, I should really keep an open mind about this. It seemed to connect with some of my own experiences in the classroom. But as I say, until I really started digging into what Willingham was saying, the puzzle pieces didn't all start clicking together.\n\nThe short version: All people learn differently—no one is arguing that. As Willingham explains, some learners are strong visual thinkers and some are better at remembering auditory stimuli. But it's what happens in schools when these differences are \"recognized\" that's all wrong.\n\nThose students who are pegged by teachers as visual or auditory learners have the potential to become limited in their views of themselves as learners. Let me explain. For the learning style theory to be true, an auditory learner would always learn best through hearing the sounds of words, for example. The truth is that sometimes all of us need visual, auditory, or kinesthetic cues.\n\nFor example, one of my students was identified as an auditory learner — it said so on his IEP. To stay consistent with the learning style theory this would mean that when we were learning about the 13 colonies, he would need to hear the sounds of the colonies to guide him to remember the information. But the truth is: for this history lesson it was a visual map that clinched his learning. He was not an auditory learner in this situation.\n\nThe dangers that come from believing in the learning style theory can occur when teachers hear, for example, that a student is a kinesthetic learner, so they make sure to include manipulatives in a lesson. Yet sometimes the manipulatives can distract students from the focus of the lesson. This may result in the teacher saying, \"I don't know why he still doesn't get it, I used manipulatives to meet his needs.\"\n\nIn these examples, it was the context of the particular lesson and/or the particular environment — not learning styles — that needed to be in focus.\n\nRather than adhering to the learning style theory, I have come to see that learning is flexible and teachers can meet the variable needs of students through these principles of a universal design for learning. I mentioned in my last post that I believed that as teachers make the instructional shifts with the Common Core, they must also make what I call the perspective shifts. It doesn't make sense to peg individuals as one type of learner or another. As Willingham states, \"We're really asking students to remember meaning. Most of what we want students to learn isn't sound or visually based…it's meaning based.\"\n\nIs anyone with me during this Aha moment? Do you see the potential for this perspective shift?\n\nThat elephant in the school\n\nSo, the lingering question: If learning styles do not exist then why do most people (including many educators) continue to go along their merry way as if they do?\n\nWillingham claims that the learning style theory seems so right because:\n\n1. A large percentage of people have believed in it for so long.\n\n2. Part of the theory is right — people do learn in different ways. But it's the pegboard way these differences are addressed in the classroom that is wrong.\n\n3. When the belief in the learning style theory is present, a person will continue to interpret future situations (especially ambiguous ones) as consistent with the theory. If you believe something to be true (and decline to consider contradictory evidence), you will have a strong tendency to interpret situations to be consistent with your belief.\n\nI've asked a few learning-style diehards why they believe in the theory. Here's the general response, I know my students, and no one can tell me that they do not have individual learning styles. Here's the catch…they DO.\n\nBut the diehards aren't paying close attention: Willingham and other thought leaders in this area are not denying that students learn differently. They are saying that we need to change our perspective about what \"different\" means for teaching and learning. One thing it doesn't mean is pigeon-holing students into a single learning \"box.\"\n\nThe way I see it\n\nThe learning style theory is not the glue that holds my lessons together. The way I meet the needs of diverse learners is by focusing on learner variability and providing access to the curriculum so that students may construct meaning in every way that works for them.\n\nIt's not about creating lessons for specific learning styles. It's about creating accessible learning environments by removing barriers, including those that cut students off from learning opportunities. Here's a quote that sums it all up for me:\n\nGood teaching is good teaching and teachers don't need to adjust their teaching to individual learning styles.\" ~Daniel Willingham\n\nCheck out this book review for more details about Willingham's ideas for creating meaningful learning experiences.

Learning styles shouldn't be about how we put the information in–input should ALWAYS strive to be multi-sensory. VAK should be making sure that kids have a variety of different mnemonics to file that knowledge and pull it OUT most effectively & efficiently.\n\nThe Pashler, et.al. study did not evaluate was variance between input vs. retrieval in learning styles. His learning theory analysis was based on the idea that learning styles should help teachers better INPUT information. In fact, the study even makes \"a basic distinction between what we call the existence of study preferences and what we call the learning-styles hypothesis.\" (p108) Then, you look at a meta-analysis of 34 studies involving the use of VAK mnemonic strategies with students who have learning disabilities, the overall effect size was a very strong 1.62 (Mastropieri, Sweda, & Scrugs, 2000).\n\nIf a student is struggling, keying into learning style preferences may help a teacher identify mnemonics that could help that student better recall the information–but definitely don't skimp on curriculum design that encompasses all the modalities when teaching new concepts to your students!\n\nJen, thanks for your informative and insightful post. Yes! The way we present the information to students should always be multi-sensory. But I do not like to describe it that way. It's a matter of semantics. But I've noticed that the word \"multi-sensory\" trips teachers back into thinking inside a narrow learning style theory box. Or they gloss over the need to present information through multiple pathways.\n\nAs you say, we should be making sure to present students with a variety, which is why UDL is perfect! It's about providing multiple means of representation, engagement and expression. Students' individual strengths and needs will be addressed while keeping a focus on the meaning of each lesson.\n\nThanks for clarifying that there is a place to supplement students' learning needs through their personal strengths and preferences through mnemonics.\n\nFor those who would like to learn more about the research Jen referenced, check out these links:\n\nWhat about interest and motivation? There may be no barriers in place that prevent learning, but the students aren't interested or motivated by the way in which material is presented. I recall a four year old student to whom I was teaching letter identification while using manipulative cards for pick up when I named the letter. This was certainly more interesting than a worksheet, but still not an enticing activity for him. I gave him a bean bag and asked him to toss it to the letter on the board. He then became very engaged in the activity and began to learn. Was he a kinesthetic learner or was the activity just more interesting and motivating for him because he enjoys moving? If we think about the multiple intelligences in terms of interest and motivation, do they in turn impact student's ability to learn? In order for student learning to take place, they certainly need to be \"engaged\"!\n\nAlso, the three brain networks and UDL principles can help to clarify the role of motivation and interest: \n\nI think that you provided multiple means of representing the letters as well as flexibility in the ways he was able to express his knowledge. He was an active participant in the learning process. He was connected and, therefore, engaged. That's what it's all about!\n\nPart 1: Great post! Thanks for the link to the video. I really hadn't given learning style theory too much thought. Truth be told I was thinking of learning \"styles\" more as a flexible way to support students than as putting them in a box for all time.\n\nI agree with you that addressing learner variability through applying UDL principles would be much more effective than using learning style theory.\n\nPerhaps learning style theory inhibits learning if applied exactly as it is stated but does teacher awareness of learning style theory inhibit or support learning? Was learning style theory what initially got educators thinking about presenting and expressing information differently? Do teachers who use the concepts of learning style theory end up engaging more students?\n\nPart 2 – The underlying question I'm left with is does learning style theory inhibit progress for UDL to become more \"mainstream\"? Do we buy in to it because it is simple to define and apply while UDL isn't? If that is the case, is there a way to more simply define and apply UDL?\n\nIn sections of this post:  I wrote about Denise DeCoste visiting (via Skype) a class that I was taking this summer and speaking to us about a process of implementing UDL that she was involved in. What I liked about it was that they made it simple. They defined 4 essential elements of UDL and then started with the idea of providing choices rather than starting with technology. In fact, they didn't look at technology until the teachers were comfortable with more flexible approaches and then brought it in. On this note, the fact that teachers are familiar with the idea of learning styles (even though they may not be familiar with the full theory behind it) might actually help in making that first step related to choice.\n\nHello @mom2mikey! It was great to chat with you on Twitter yesterday! I am glad you brought our conversation to this forum—it gives others a chance to join in on a great discussion. Readers, please add your voice!\n\n@mom2mikey, I love your stream of questions—it's a great way to push our thinking along.\n\nI think teachers use the term learning styles loosely by giving credit to the idea of learning styles for the success of a lesson when the success of a lesson is due to an accessible curriculum and meaningful learning activities, so students may connect with it.\n\nI think the learning style theory inhibits teachers' views on the way their students think. More importantly, I think the learning style theory inhibits the way we guide our students to view themselves as learners. It then becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy that may limit learning experiences. We should be guiding students to be flexible thinkers—ready to learn, connect, and achieve to their personal best in a variety of situations.", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "ecf88827-cff8-423c-a348-e63b1cb61200", "url": "http://www.middleweb.com/9016/we-dont-need-learning-styles/"}

{"text": "Washington State University researchers have found they can control one of fruit growers' more severe pests, aphids, with a remarkably benign tool: flowers. The discovery is a boon for organic as well as conventional tree fruit growers.\n\nThe researchers recently published their study in the journal Biological Control. They found that plantings of sweet alyssum attracted a host of spiders and predator bugs that in turn preyed on woolly apple aphids, a pest that growers often control with chemical sprays.\n\n\"The results were striking,\" said Lessando Gontijo, who led the research project while a doctoral student in the WSU Department of Entomology. \"After one week, aphid densities were significantly lower on trees adjacent to flowers than on control plots, and these differences were maintained for several weeks.\"\n\nTo select an appropriate flower for the study, the researchers screened six candidates, including marigolds and zinnias. They chose sweet alyssum because it attracted the greatest number of hoverflies, or syrphids, which have larvae that often feed on aphids. Hoverflies and other insects are attracted to flowers because they can find food in the form of pollen and nectar.\n\nResearchers compared plots of apple trees with sweet alyssum to plots without flowers. While the sweet alyssum attracted hoverflies, as desired, Gontijo and colleagues found few hoverfly larvae, showing that the hoverflies had only a marginal effect on the aphid population.\n\nThe mystery of the disappearing aphids seemed solved when the researchers found a diverse community of spiders and predatory insects in the plots with sweet alyssum. But was it really the flowers that attracted aphid predators? The scientists sprayed protein markers on the sweet alyssum and later captured insects and spiders at a distance from the flower plots. Many of the insects and spiders tested positive for the proteins, proving that they had visited the flowers.\n\n\"The woolly apple aphid is surprisingly damaging for an aphid, attacking tree shoots and roots,\" said Betsy Beers, an entomologist based at WSU's Tree Fruit Research and Extension Center in Wenatchee and Gontijo's mentor and co-author on the paper. \"These aphids also secrete a sticky liquid called honeydew, which can coat the apples, causing much annoyance during harvest.\"\n\nThe aphids were previously kept at bay when orchardists sprayed pesticides to control codling moths. Since the phase-out of organophosphate insecticides, though, the woolly apple aphid has been making a comeback in central Washington and elsewhere.\n\nThe researchers state that the use of sweet alyssum for biological control can be easily integrated with standard orchard-management practices and should be especially appealing to organic growers, who have fewer insecticide options.\n\nThe article, \"Flowers promote aphid suppression in apple orchards,\" was published in the July 2013 edition of Biological Control and is available online at  WSU entomologist William Snyder was a co-author.", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "452d3078-86a6-454d-99bd-4c197775d437", "url": "http://westernfarmpress.com/orchard-crops/fight-orchard-aphids-flower-power"}

{"text": "In today's world, Ethernet cable and jacks are installed in commercial buildings for network connectivity almost as much as electrical wires and sockets are installed for electricity. Therefore, it is important to know how to install and connect an Ethernet cable jack in a wall. The following steps describe how this can be done.\n\nAd\n\nSteps\n\n1\n\nTurn off all electricity to electrical circuits that you will be working in close proximity to.\n\nAd\n\n2\n\nReview the networking key map in order to determine a location for your Ethernet cable jack. A popular place for this to be located is on the opposite side of a stud from where an electrical socket is located.\n\n3\n\nUsing a measuring tape and a stud finder mark the location where the Ethernet outlet will be located.\n\n4\n\nUsing a torpedo level, place the wall plate mounting bracket on the wall and trace the inner part of the bracket on the wall.\n\n5\n\nCut a square hole in the wall using a drywall saw and the traced lines from the previous step. Be sure not to cut too big of a hole. If you cut the hole too small you can always go back and cut a little more out using a drywall saw.\n\n6\n\nInstall the wall plate mounting bracket into the wall according to manufacturing directions.\n\n7\n\nIf necessary drill at least a 1\" diameter hole in the top of the wall directly above where your Ethernet outlet will be located.\n\n8\n\nRun a fish tape from the top of the wall to the hole for the Ethernet outlet.\n\n9\n\nAttach a very durable, but small in diameter, rope to the end of the fish tape and pull the fish tape out of the wall while pulling the rope into and out of the top of the wall. Ensure that the rope is long enough to have a foot of extra rope above the top of the wall and at least a foot of rope out of the Ethernet outlet hole.\n\n10\n\nAttach the rope above the wall to the Ethernet cable coming from the main panel box. Ensure that the cable is the correct one for this particular outlet. It is recommended that a combination of a good knot and electrical tape is used to attach the rope to the cable. Pulling the cable down to the outlet opening can be especially difficult if there is insulation in the wall where you are pulling the cable.\n\n11\n\nOnce the cable has been pulled through the outlet opening with about a foot of extra cable, use a wire stripper to remove approximately 2\" of the cable jacket at the end of the cable. Do not nick any of the small wires that are part of the cable when using the wire strippers to remove the cable jacket.\n\n12\n\nUntwist the wires just enough so that the wires can be installed on the RJ45 female jack. Do not twist the wires any more than necessary due to the potential for interference on the wires if the cables are untwisted too far.\n\n13\n\nPlace the wires by hand into the color coded notches on the jack. The wires should be installed into the jack with the ends of the wires going out towards the sides of the jack. The wires will be installed using an A or B type color code. Both color codes are sufficient but should be used uniformly throughout the building.\n\n14\n\nUsing a punch down tool fully seat the wires to the RJ45 jack. Trim off any excess wire from the jack\n\n15\n\nInstall the jack into the wall plate and screw the wall plate to the wall plate mounting bracket. Push any excess cable back in the wall.\n\n16\n\nTest the connection using a cable tester.\n\nAd\n\nWe could really use your help!\n\nCan you tell us about\n\nGenealogy?\n\nYes\n\nNo\n\nCan you tell us about\n\nFive Nights at Freddy's?\n\nYes\n\nNo\n\nCan you tell us about\n\nPowerpoint", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "097ac5bc-5897-4056-9876-736e2f8e59d0", "url": "http://www.wikihow.com/Install-an-Ethernet-Jack-in-a-Wall"}

Flash is the worst thing that has happened to the Internets.\n\nquadratic means they use 4 different geometric equations to govern their sidecut radii. its a progressive sidecut meaning the harder you turn, the harder your board will turn. you will normally only find these kinds of sidecuts on freeride boards. if you sketch a landing in the park with one of these, your board can kinda get away from you, which is why park boards are usually a single, maybe 2, sidecut equations.\n\nOk from what I have read, the quadratic sidecut basically means that the board is cut into three seperate radial cuts as opposed to a single radial cut. This is suppose to give the board more contact points (specifically around the feet)and give the board uninterupted contact with the snow. In other words, the quadratic sidecut has three seperate curves that form the sidecut vs. a single continuous flowing sidecut. Salomon calls this \"Equalizer technology\" and it seems that every company that uses this type of sidecut has there own name for it and a little bit of a design twist to dodge patents. The Burton boards with PDE edges also use this sidecut???\nWouldn't a blending of 3 or more radii be a tri-radial or quad-radial, ect. sidecut?\nA quadratic sidecut, as stated comes from the quadratic equation (which is not the equation for several different circles). It makes a quadratic shape which consists of an infinite amount of blended circles. It essentially does the same thing as a tri-radial sidecut but with smoother transitions between different radii, becuase, well, the whole thing is a transition zone. Check out the shape of the graph: Quadratic equation - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\nAs you can see it has a smaller radius for tighter turns in the center, but not necessarily stable at high speed, and a larger radius at the ends to ease you into turns.\n\nThe similar-but-opposite sidecut would be the elliptical sidecut. It is also an infinite number of blended radii (not continuous) but it has a smaller radius at the tips to get you into turns fast, and larger radius at the middle so it is more stable at speed. Check out the graph: Ellipse - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\nIt is also worth noting that when you tilt an ellipse (like putting a board on edge) it closely resembles a circle(when viewed from perpendicular to the slope) - which leads to those nice perfect c-carves\n\nGot some intelligence here. Yeah, you're right. And I didn't say the elliptical was continuous, just radial. There would definitely be an infinite number of radii. I think what the manufacturers mean by 3 or 4 radii is that they're looking for a specific radius in a specific spot. This also confused me with being different from the tri radial, which is probably 3 radii contected by a tangent line, which would be different than quadratic.\n\nFrom what I've read, I'm almost positive the tri radial and quadratic are different. The quadratic and elliptical should be different in that the change in radius in an elliptical sidecut is much more gradual, allowing you to make those long smooth carves.\n\nAs I said before, there are a lot of quadratic equations for making different curves, and I'll admit I'm no mathematician. If you look up Palmer Project, they use Klothoid (really clothoid) sidecut derived from the cornu spiral which is like quadratic but in reverse. So, like you said, it would be comparable to an elliptical sidecut. Anyhow, they show how different spots have larger or smaller circles.

{"text": "Pneumonia from Inhalation of Foreign Matter in Dogs\n\nAspiration (or inhalation) pneumonia is a condition in which a dog's lungs become inflamed due to the inhalation of foreign matter, from vomiting, or from the regurgitation of gastric acid contents. Aspiration pneumonia can also be a direct result of a neuromuscular disorder, which would cause difficulty with swallowing, as well as problems associated with the esophagus, with possible paralysis of the esophagus.\n\nOther causes for a dysfunction of the lungs may be an obstructed airway, or inhalation of gastric acids, which can cause extensive damage to the internal tissues of the lungs. Bacteria present in the inhaled foreign matter may also bring about infection.\n\nAspiration pneumonia is more prevalent in dogs than cats. If you would like to learn how this disease affects cats, please visit this page in the PetMD health library.\n\nSymptoms and Types\n\nSymptoms of aspiration pneumonia include breathing difficulties, swallowing difficulties, coughing, fever, discharge from the nasal passages, rapid breathing, increased heart rate, a bluish tinge to the skin (cyanosis), and a possible intolerance to exercise due to weakness. An altered mood, vomiting, loss of appetite, and regurgitation may also be present, depending on the underlying reasons for this condition.\n\nCauses\n\nCommon causes associated with aspiration pneumonia include abnormalities associated with the pharynx and neuromuscular disorders, which affect both the nerves and muscles.\n\nAn enlargement of the lower aspect of the dog's esophagus (due to regurgitation of gastric acid), or an incorrectly placed feeding tube can also lead to aspiration pneumonia.\n\nDiagnosis\n\nYour veterinarian will conduct a thorough physical examination using visual and audio diagnostic tools in order to gain a full perspective of the condition of the dog's lungs. Further testing, such as abdominal palpation, chest X-rays, a complete blood profile, including a chemical blood profile, and a complete blood count, may also be called for.\n\nBlood tests will indicate the presence of infection, and chest X-rays will show if aspiration pneumonia is present. Fluid may be taken from the lungs for the purpose of defining whether there are bacteria present, and if so, will help determine which antibiotic will best serve in healing your dog.\n\nIf your pet is suffering from respiratory distress, your veterinarian may suggest a blood gas analysis, which is a test that measures the levels of oxygen and carbon dioxide concentrations in the blood.\n\nYour veterinarian may also order a swallowing study for the purpose of concluding whether or not there is a dysfunction of the esophagus. An internal flourescent video X-ray, called a fluoroscopy, may be considered as well, to further assess the muscles of the esophagus, and their ability to move food down to the stomach.", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "46b26193-1d14-49b7-94ad-2626bd82ea3b", "url": "http://www.petmd.com/dog/conditions/respiratory/c_multi_pneumonia_aspiration"}

{"text": "ormous debt\n\n3.\n• Republic of the Philippines external debt is the amount of money owed by\nthe Filipinos to foreign creditors such as Asian Development Bank (ADB) and\nthe World Bank.\n• In 2010, the total outstanding foreign debt of the country is US$ 60 billion,\nwhich accounts for 31.8% of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of that same\nyear. The external debt portfolio consists mostly of medium to long-term\nloans, used to finance the economic activities and reforms of the government.\n\n4.\nBeginning of Phil. High external debts…\n• Ferdinand Marcos (Dec 1965 - Feb 1986)\n▫ During the years 1966 to 1969, Marcos borrowed a great amount of\nmoney to finance his domestic expansion and reforms. This\nexpansion in the government budget led to increases in the current\naccount deficit and crisis in the balance of payments.\n\n5.\n• Corazon Aquino (Feb 1986 - Jun 1992)\n▫ When Corazon Aquino won the February 1986 presidential elections,\nthe external debt increased to some US$ 28 billion. She aimed to\nmeet debt-service payments and reduce debt size in the long run.\n\n6.\n• Fidel V. Ramos (Jun 1992 - Jun 1998)\n▫ The 12th president of the Philippines, President Fidel Ramos was able\nto uplift the economy of the country through focusing on \"people\nempowerment\" and \"global competitiveness.\" During his time, the\nPhilippines was considered as one of the \"Tiger Cub Economies\" in Asia\nwith its continuous growth and prosperity.\n\n7.\n• Joseph Ejercito Estrada (Jun 1998 - Jan 2001)\n▫ The Estrada administration was not able to follow through on the\nachievements of the previous administration. Plagued with rumors on\ncorrupt and inept actions of the government, the country lost some of the\ntrust of foreign entrepreneurs and investors, thus reducing the source of\nfinances of the administration. This had further caused the country to\nborrow from banks and financing institutions in national and\ninternational levels, which in turn caused the Philippines to be more in\ndebt.\n\n8.\nGloria Macapagal-Arroyo (Jan 2001 - June 2010)\n• During Arroyo administration, foreign debt of the country had\nreached its peak in 2003 with an outstanding of US$ 57.6\nbillion, which is more than the combined borrowings of the last\ntwo governments. This has eventually led to a state of fiscal\ncrisis with huge amount of deficit, as admitted by President\nArroyo in 2004.\n\n10.\nExternal Debt\n• a portion of the total debt of a country that is borrowed from\ncreditors outside the country. These creditors may include foreign\nbanks, private corporations or individuals. These loans are to be\npaid in the currency in which the loan was made thus, the country\nmay export goods to the lending country.\n\n11.\n• Type of Debt\n▫ The external debt remained predominantly medium to long-term (MLT) in nature, with\nthese accounts representing 90.6 percent of the total external debt. MLT accounts are\nthose which are paid more than a year and is distributed over a longer period of time.\n• Borrower\n▫ The Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) is the financial institution that regulates and\napproves the amount of external debt the Philippines. It also controls and makes sure that\nthere is enough money to be paid and there is sustainability in the country's external debt.\n• Institutional Creditors\n▫ The World Bank is a financial institution that aids third-world countries in their\ndevelopment by lending them money. Its main goal is to lessen poverty in the whole world.\n• Country Creditors\n▫ The Philippines does not only borrow from financial institutions but also to foreign\ncountries with high supply of money. Some of these countries are the United States of\nAmerica, Japan, United Kingdom, France, and Germany.\n\n12.\nRisk of External debts to the Philippines\n• The country might focus too much and allot a big part of its budget\nto the payment of the debt and forget the other aspects of the\ncountry that it has to work on.\n• The reputation of a country is also at stake when external debt is\nlooked at and may discourage investments to enter into the\ncountry.\n• High external debt also tends to precipitate crises - if, at some\npoint, investors lose faith in the Philippines' ability to service its\nexternal debt or its ability to roll the debt over, they would be\nexpected to pull capital out of the country.\n\n14.\nHistory:\n• The World Bank was created at Bretton Woods in 1944 to lend\nto European countries to help them rebuild after World War II. It\nwas the world's first multilateral development bank, and was\nfunded through the sale of World Bonds. Its first loans were to\nFrance and other European countries, but soon lent money to\nChile, Mexico and India to build power plants and railways. By\n1975, the Bank also lent money to countries to help with family\nplanning, pollution control and environmentalism.\n• The World Bank comprises two institutions: the International\nBank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) and\nthe International Development Association (IDA).\n\n15.\nPresident\n• Jim Yong Kim\n▫ A naturalised American citizen before taking office. Physician and\nanthropologist, co-founder of Partners in Health and 17th President\nof Dartmouth College. Elected on 16 April 2012.\n\n16.\nPurpose\n• The World Bank has one central purpose: to promote economic\nand social progress in developing countries by helping to raise\nproductivity so that their people may live a better and fuller life.\n\n18.\n• Henry Hazlitt argued that the World Bank along with the monetary system it was designed\nwithin would promote world inflation and \"a world in which international trade is State-\ndominated\" when they were being advocated. Stiglitz argued that the so-called free\nmarket reform policies which the Bank advocates are often harmful to economic\ndevelopment if implemented badly, too quickly (\"shock therapy\"), in the wrong sequence or\nin weak, uncompetitive economies.\n• The other issue of the World Bank has been the way in which it is governed. While the World\nBank represents 188 countries, it is run by a small number of economically powerful\ncountries. These countries (which also provide most of the institution's funding) choose the\nleadership and senior management of the World Bank, and so their interests dominate the\nbank. Titus Alexander argues that the unequal voting power of western countries and the\nWorld Bank's role in developing countries makes it similar to the South African\nDevelopment Bank under apartheid, and therefore a pillar of global apartheid.\n• The United States Senate Committee on Foreign Relations reported the World Bank and\nother international financial institutions for focusing too much \"on issuing loans rather than\non achieving concrete development results within a finite period of time\" and called on the\ninstitution to \"strengthen anti-corruption efforts.\"\n\n19.\n• October Rebellion was the collective name for the series\nof protest events surrounding the fall 2007 meetings of the World\nBank andInternational Monetary Fund on October 19 –\n20, 2007, in Washington, D.C., United States. The events were\norganized by the October Coalition. According to the October\nCoalition's call to action, the group demanded an end to all third world\ndebt using the financial institutions' own resources, the end to\nstructural adjustment policies believed to prioritize profit over the lives\nof individuals, and an end to social and environmental issues caused by\noil and gas production, mining, and certain kinds of infrastructure\ndevelopment.\n\n20.\n• World Bank Oslo 2002 Protests were organized by Oslo 2002, an umbrella organization\nfor about 50 participating organizations including labour unions, political\nparties, environmental organizations, church organizations and ATTAC from Norway,\nSweden and Denmark. While each participant had its own reasons, here were the Oslo 2002\nnetwork mottos:\n▫ \"Our world is not for sale--stop the World Bank's undemocratic market policies!\"\n▫ \"Cancel Third World debt--release the choke hold!!\"\n▫ \"Free trade pollutes!\"\n▫ \"Yes to women and women's rights--no to the World Bank!\"\n▫ \"Stop the World Bank's attack on labour rights!\"\nThe network claimed that the World Bank is an undemocratic institution used by rich\nnations to control poor countries. EinarBraathen and ReidunHeiene of ATTAC Norway and\nthe Oslo 2002 network also criticized the bank for believing too much in market-\nbased solutions.\n\n21.\nAsian Development Bank (ADB)\n• The Asian Development Bank (ADB) is a regional development\nbank established on 22 August 1966 to facilitate economic development of\ncountries in Asia.The bank admits the members of the United Nations\nEconomic and Social Commission for Asia and the\nPacific (UNESCAP, formerly known as the United Nations Economic\nCommission for Asia and the Far East) and non-regional developed\ncountries.\n• From 31 members at its establishment, ADB now has 67 members - of which\n48 are from within Asia and the Pacific and 19 outside. ADB was modeled\nclosely on the World Bank, and has a similar weighted voting system where\nvotes are distributed in proportion with member's capital subscriptions.\n\n22.\n• Central to the ADB's advice is encouraging private companies to\ninvest in and construct power plants. They have argued that\ninvolving the private sector better distributes economic risks\namong those who can best absorb them, and that cash-starved\ngovernment gain benefits at little risk.\n\n23.\n• PURPOSE\n▫ The main purpose of the Asian Development Bank is to provide loans and\ninvestment money to the countries of Asia as a way to assist in their\ndevelopment. In particular the loans are granted to the poorer nations in the\nregion so that they can improve both their economic and social conditions. In\nmost cases the loans are treated as commercial loans and need to be paid back\nwith interest by the borrowing country. However in some cases the loans will\nbe concessional requiring that only part of the money be repaid. This will\ndepend on the borrowing country and what the money is being used for.\n• GOALS\n▫ ADB is committed to achieving the goals of the MillenniumDevelopment Goal's\nin partner countries through its Enhanced Poverty Reduction Strategy. ADB\nsupports investments relevant to achieving the MDGs and supports the\ncollection of statistics to monitor the progress made toward achieving the\nMDGs.\n\n24.\nIssue\nADB and Napocor\n• The National Power Corp. (Napocor) is seeking another waiver\nfrom its multilateral creditors, Asian Development Bank (ADB)\nand the World Bank (WB) for failure to comply with loan\nagreements, government documents showed.\n\n25.\nInternational Monetary Fund (IMF)\n• The IMF works to foster global growth and economic stability. It\nprovides policy advice and financing to members in economic\ndifficulties and also works with developing nations to help them\nachieve macroeconomic stability and reduce poverty.\n\n26.\nPhilippines lend money to IMF\n• The Philippines is lending the International Monetary Fund $1\nbillion to help stabilize the global economy amid the euro zone's\ndebt crisis, the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas said on Wednesday.\n• The $1 billion the Philippines lent the IMF forms part of the $456\nbillion crisis fund that the lender secured from its member-\nnations to help insulate the global economy from any spillover\nfrom the euro zone's financial difficulties.\"\n\n27.\nDifference between IMF and World Bank\nInternational Monetary Fund World Bank\n• oversees the international monetary system\n• promotes exchange stability and orderly\nexchange relations among its member countries\n• assists all members--both industrial and\ndeveloping countries--that find themselves in\ntemporary balance of payments difficulties by\nproviding short- to medium-term credits\n• supplements the currency reserves of its\nmembers through the allocation of SDRs (special\ndrawing rights); to date SDR 21.4 billion has\nbeen issued to member countries in proportion\nto their quotas\n• draws its financial resources principally from the\nquota subscriptions of its member countries\n• has at its disposal fully paid-in quotas now\ntotaling SDR 145 billion (about $215 billion)\n• has a staff of 2,300 drawn from 182 member\ncountries\n• seeks to promote the economic development of\nthe world's poorer countries\n• assists developing countries through long-term\nfinancing of development projects and programs\n• provides to the poorest developing countries\nwhose per capita GNP is less than $865 a year\nspecial financial assistance through the\nInternational Development Association (IDA)\n• encourages private enterprises in developing\ncountries through its affiliate, the International\nFinance Corporation (IFC)\n• acquires most of its financial resources by\nborrowing on the international bond market\n• has an authorized capital of $184 billion, of\nwhich members pay in about 10 percent\n• has a staff of 7,000 drawn from 180 member\ncountries\n\n28.\nFiscal policy is one of those areas where everyone has an opinion but few people can\nagree on any given idea. While reducing debt and stimulating the economy are the general\ngoals of most governments in developed economies, achieving those goals often involves\ntactics that appear to be mutually exclusive and sometimes downright contradictory.\nWAYS TO REDUCE GOVERNMENT EXTERNAL DEBTS:\nBonds\nTake for example the issuance of government debt. Governments often issue bonds to\ngenerate revenue. This enables them to avoid raising taxes and provides money to stimulate\nthe economy, theoretically generating additional tax income from prosperous businesses and\ntaxpayers.\n\n29.\nInterest Rate Manipulation\n• Maintaining low interest rates is another way governments seek to\nstimulate the economy, generate tax revenue and, ultimately,\nreduce the national debt. Low interest rates make it easy for\nindividuals and businesses to borrow money. In turn, the\nborrowers spend that money on goods and services, which creates\njobs and tax revenues. Low interest rates have been employed by\nthe Unites States, the European Union, the United Kingdom and\nother nations with some degree of success. That noted, interest\nrates kept at or near zero for extended periods of time have not\nproved to be a panacea for debt-ridden governments.\n\n30.\n• Spending Cuts\n-the act of reducing spending\n• Raise Taxes\n-tax increases are a common tactic. Despite the frequency of\nthe practice, most nations face large and growing debts. It is likely\nthat this is largely due to the failure to cut spending. When cash\nflows increase and spending continues to rise, the increased\nrevenues make little difference to the overall debt level.", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "110f6ffb-afcc-49c0-abe7-3b9dcdc376db", "url": "http://www.slideshare.net/eliphina/enormous-debt"}

{"text": "Category Archives: Observations about Life\n\nPost navigation\n\nI like the Walking Dead, Longmire, and Man in the High Castle. I couldn't care less about Game of Thrones.\n\nI liked Twilight and 50 Shades of Gray, but I liked The Girl With All the Gifts by MR Carey and Fahrenheit 451 by Ray Bradbury better.\n\nI see judgmental articles online all the time about what it means if someone likes \"trashy\" books like Twilight and 50 Shades. I also see tons of response articles with people saying they won't apologize for their taste.\n\nWhy is this so common? Why is it such a thing for people to pass judgement on other people's choice of entertainment? What in particular does it say about me as a person that I can enjoy the entire spectrum of novels, all the way from the widely criticized to the highly revered?\n\nIn my opinion, the answer is not much.\n\nWhat it says about me is that I have broad tastes and that I enjoy many things. I enjoy things, not because I'm supposed to or they're popular (or unpopular), but simply because they entertain me. I'm all about relishing what entertains me, unapologetically. I don't feel the need to hide fondness for romance, or to brag about it when I'm reading classics. Because while one might expand my knowledge and thinking, the other is something I like. I don't need reasons to enjoy something, just like I don't need to explain why, for me, mint chocolate chip will always win over vanilla.\n\nIf you see me sitting at the coffee shop, and I'm reading a book that you consider awful, think about this: yesterday, I may have been reading a classic or difficult book. And if I am reading that \"difficult book\" while I'm standing in line at the grocery store, don't assume that says anything about me. I'm likely to also have something by Nora Roberts in my purse.\n\nI read a lot, and I don't judge other people for any reading habits, other than when they say, \"I like to read, but I don't have time for it.\" If you don't like to read and don't do it, that's cool. But if you claim you don't have time, I call shenanigans. There's always time for what you like.\n\nAnyway, the point is that judging people based on their taste in entertainment is silly. And if you weren't sneaking peeks at what I'm reading, maybe you'd have time to finish that book that's been sitting on your bedside table for the last six months.\n\nThis is the expression on my face when I watch other people take political discussions personally.\n\nI have my own thoughts on the upcoming US Presidential election, and since this isn't a political blog, I'm not going to talk about them. What I did want to talk about was a trend that's disturbing me among my Facebook friends.\n\nSome people are posting support for one candidate or another in the upcoming elections, and responses to those posts have been varied. But far more often, I've seen people posting opposition to one candidate or another. Instead of saying, \"I support A,\" people are saying, \"You shouldn't support A. They're a (fill in derogatory term).\"\n\nRecently, one of my friends posted something like this, and one of the responses was that this election has been the most polarizing election they remember. My friend, without a trace of irony, said something like, \"Yeah, I've had to unfriend a number of people for their views.\"\n\nPeople… let's agree to disagree on the candidates. There are very few people (I've seen) who are offering unqualified support of either candidate. Most people are choosing what they view as the lesser of two evils. Why are we going to argue about that? Supporting one candidate over another doesn't mean you support racism, sexism, lying, conspiracy theories, or whatever it is the opposition says that candidate is all about. Supporting one candidate over another means you have your reasons, and that's all I need to know.\n\nI have gotten into political debates/ discussions with some people. But only in person, with people I feel safe voicing my opinions with. In a public forum like Facebook, I think there's too much room for misunderstanding and hard feelings. It's unlikely I'm going to change anyone's mind about their choice, so in this particular case, I'm not going to try.\n\nIt's easy and tempting to believe that others aren't as informed or haven't thought it through the way I have. That's probably not true though. Others value some issues more than others, just as I do. And we're all different.\n\nLet's rise above the political candidates and stop the name calling. Let's stop getting angry with people because they disagree on our views. If you must get into a political discussion, please be respectful of the other person's views, even if you don't agree with them. Let's thank others for the lively discussions that may ensue. And above all, let's be grateful that we live in a country where it's okay to publicly criticize candidates, and that others can do so too.\n\nIn Fahrenheit 451, Bradbury discusses how censorship started by certain interest groups demanding that things that offended them be taken out, until there was nothing left. Let's not encourage censorship by demeaning the opinions of others.\n\nI spent the first 24 years of my life in the same house. I lived on campus during my first year of college, but I never really considered it home, and after that first year, I became a commuter. I was never particularly adventurous.\n\nSince then, I've moved four times and had seven jobs. I've met a lot of people. Most of them didn't leave much of a mark on me. I met them, maybe laughed with them, learned some things about them, and moved on. They might give me a passing thought now and then, as I do them, but nothing more.\n\nI sometimes talk about how Facebook and other social media have allowed us to disconnect in some ways, and I still believe that. But I've also been able to connect with other people I'd lost touch with. I stay connected with childhood friends and family. Though I may not follow their daily lives, I can see how they're doing and how they're children are doing. It's a really nice thing that would have been difficult and unlikely in a pre-technology world.\n\nThere are a handful of people who've been important to me, who I've lost contact with for one reason or another. There was a guy I worked with at Wal-mart, and we didn't stay in touch when I moved to a different job. There was a couple who my husband and I hung out with. We moved out of that area abruptly and during a period of transition, lost touch. I don't remember their last names.\n\nI think about them, and others, from time to time and wonder what's happened to them, how they're doing, and where they've been. I'd love to reconnect with some of these people, just to know how they're doing.\n\nWhen I started moving on, leaving people behind, I didn't think of it that way. For the first two decades plus of my life, I'd stayed put, so I didn't think about the effort it takes to stay connected.\n\nI'm grateful for our connected world, but I'm also aware that real connections take effort. And if someone is important, they're worth the effort. Sometimes people get left behind, and that's okay too.\n\nI've been the person that's been left behind, and I have to remind myself that people don't always do it on purpose. There are a lot of reasons to lose touch with someone.\n\nThat's why it's so important to really enjoy the people I'm with, be in the moment with them, without cell phones or distractions. If I lose touch with them, I'll have had those great moments. It's okay to move on, to have different friends or different interests.\n\nNone of us stand still. Or we shouldn't, if we're growing.\n\nHave you had an experience of losing touch with a friend and wishing you could reconnect?\n\nWe weren't friends. I knew her since elementary school because we rode the bus together. I distinctly remember her bullying me a time or two.\n\nIn high school, she left me alone. I don't think we ever had a real conversation.\n\nShe friended me on Facebook, and I accepted. Since then, she's been open about her struggle with depression, which makes sense in light of my memories of her and what I know now about the link between depression and anger in kids.\n\nA few years ago, I posted pictures of a Halloween party I had when I was 10 on Facebook. Recently, this girl commented on the photo that she remembered the party and that she had such a good time.\n\nI am positive that she was not there.\n\nI have no doubt that she remembers being there. It's clear to me that she wants to belong, is seeking out positive memories to help her get through the day. My first thought was to argue with her and let her know that she wasn't there; I like to be \"right\" sometimes too.\n\nBut then I thought about it and wondered why I should spoil a good memory she has, even if she's not correct. She's not a bully anymore. She's a person struggling to live her life as best as she can. So, why should it matter to me if she has good memories of a party she wasn't invited to?\n\nI wasn't a popular kid. I was a weird kid, who was usually too buried in books or my own imagination to notice how not popular I was. The only time I gave it much thought was when people picked on me.\n\nIt makes me wonder, if in some way, this girl wanted to be my friend. Because honestly, I wouldn't have noticed that either. But whether she was someone who picked on me because she was unhappy, or someone who picked on me because she wanted me to notice her, it doesn't much matter to me. It's all long since forgiven.\n\nAs a side note, I've had a few people who bullied me as a kid end up friending me on Facebook. And I find it interesting that all of them struggle with depression. They all talk about not wanting to be judged for their struggles.\n\nKeep that in mind next time you hear about a kid who's bullying someone else. I know that most of us react that we want to slap that bully down and put them in their place. But is that really the best approach for everyone involved?\n\nI'm not scarred from the bullying that happened to me. It also wasn't that bad, overall. Not compared to what you hear about nowadays. And I didn't have to deal with cyberbullying because it didn't exist back then. So I'm not saying that bullying can't be quite bad and scarring. But in my case, I believe that it made me stronger, less reactive. I have thick skin, but I also try to be understanding of people who don't. Because I've been there.\n\nHave you ever been bullied? Have you reconnected with any of your bullies? Did it change your thoughts about them in any way?\n\nActually, even though the title of the post is to buy or not, that's not really the question. The question is whether to keep them once bought.\n\nI'm a little bit of a hoarder. I know people who change out their wardrobes seasonally, and have no trouble getting rid of old clothes, but I figure that if I buy it, I should keep it.\n\nThat's why I have thousands of books. Literally, thousands.\n\nI try not to buy books. I really try. I use my local library for both ebooks and paper books. But when I buy a book, I prefer to have the physical copy.\n\nWhen I was attempting to shelve my huge collection, I started giving a lot of thought to clutter, and how much I hate it. I started to really think about why I own so many books. I haven't read all of them. Some of them were given to me by people who know I like books. Some of them are well-loved books I've read a million times or might read again. So, how do I decide which stay and which ones go? I've made up a few rules.\n\nIf it has sentimental value. My grandfather didn't read many books, but he read and loved Marley and Me. I enjoyed that book too, but even if I didn't, I'd still own a copy. It always makes me think of him. And fairy tales make me think of my grandma.\n\nIf I'm going to re-read it. I've read Watership Down more times than I can count. So much so that I recently had to buy a new copy, as my old one was falling apart. I love books that bear those kinds of marks of how well-loved they are. My copy of Pride and Prejudice has post-it flags stuck in my favorite parts, so if I'm having a bad day, I can visit my favorite parts of the story and get a quick mood boost.\n\nIf it's a classic. I'm working my way through many of the classics, and even the ones I didn't like, I'm keeping on my shelf. I figure that it it's stood up that much over the years, I may want to revisit it at a different point in my life. I tried reading 1984 for the first time a few years ago, and though I recognized that it was a good book and I should like it, I just couldn't stay interested. Two years later, I picked it up and sped through it. What's going on in my life absolutely affects what I read and how I perceive it.\n\nIf it's a \"reference\" book. This is kind of a tricky one. I write speculative fiction, so having books full of ghost stories, myths and legends, on my shelves is good practice. I never know where I might find inspiration.\n\nI haven't read it yet, but I plan to. I'm a sucker for used bookstores. Sometimes I just have to pick something up because it looks good, but then I don't get to it for awhile. I'm okay with that. But there are some books that I'll probably never get to, and I need to learn to let them go.\n\nThese rules are flexible and subject to change. But I've already taken two boxes of books to my local Half-Price books, and it feels good to know I'm reducing some of the clutter.\n\nDo you buy books or get them from the library? How do you decide which to keep and which to get rid of?\n\nI resisted joining Instagram for awhile. Well, to be more accurate, I joined, but I didn't understand it, so I left my account abandoned for a few years.\n\nRecently, I've been trying to be more active on social media and learn more about it. I resurrected my Instagram account and started posting.\n\nI followed a few accounts, mostly people like me who like books, like posting pictures of books, like admiring their bookshelves and browsing through bookstores. From my first post, I started getting likes. It was oddly satisfying, seeing that people saw my photo and took just a second to click the like button. It made me feel validated, somehow.\n\nI asked friends to tell me more about monthly photo challenges, and they directed me to search for #circleofbookishfriends. So I found and joined a bookish photo challenge for October.\n\nGetting likes is encouraging. It makes me want to post more. Just like comments and likes here are reinforcing. (Hint, hint).\n\nIt made me wonder how many behaviors in real life could be reinforced if a virtual thumbs up popped up. I think that giving trophies for participation is a bad thing because it rewards everyone, no matter what their effort or ability. But I do think that people tend to not recognize the good stuff other people do. Or maybe they recognize it, but just don't acknowledge it. Either way, I try to make sure that I notice when people do something I like, and to say something out loud.\n\nIn any case, it's fun to post pictures of books and to see what other people are reading. I enjoy looking at books as art pieces, and taking time to compose a shot and appreciate the aesthetics of my books.\n\nIf you post your Instagram handle in the comments, I'll be sure to follow you. I'm @doreeweller.\n\nFor Banned Books Week this week, I've been reading up on why books get challenged and banned. I made myself a fun little project, where I went through many of the challenged books I have on my shelf and tagged them with Post-its as to why.\n\nFirst off, when we talk about challenged and banned books, we're usually talking about from schools. Mostly middle schools and high schools. There are some extremists who try to get books banned from public libraries or taken off the shelf at bookstores, but those challenges are less common.\n\nWhy do people want to ban books? It seems like the people who want to ban books recognize the power of words, and they're afraid of that power. Words lead to thought, which lead to ideas, which lead to challenging, questioning, and often disagreeing with the status quo.\n\nGive the people contests they win by remembering the words to more popular songs or the names of state capitals or how much corn Iowa grew last year. Cram them full of noncombustible data, chock them so damn full of 'facts' they feel stuffed, but absolutely 'brilliant' with information. Then they'll feel they're thinking, they'll get a sense of motion without moving. And they'll be happy, because facts of that sort don't change. Don't give them any slippery stuff like psychology or sociology to tie things up with.\n\n-From Fahrenheit 451, by Ray Bradbury\n\nSo why don't some people want others (but especially kids) to think? I believe it's for a few reasons.\n\nFirst, book banners believe that they know the \"right\" way to live, and don't want to offer alternatives. Some people believe that the only thing that stops others from making bad choices is prevention from there being a choice. They cloak kids in misinformation and deception, saying it's for their own good. We know it doesn't work. When abstinence is the only option, kids get pregnant. When we lie and say all drugs (even marijuana) will kill you, then we lose our credibility when we say that spice and bath salts are actually really dangerous.\n\nSecond, thinking kids are questioning kids. Teens are already rebellious. They talk back, they annoy, and they think they know it all. Why add fuel to that fire? In my mind, that's the time to add fuel to that particular fire, before it's all burned out and ashes going cold. Teenagers are looking for their place in the world. Help them learn to think before they become mindless adults. They're already worried about the upcoming zombie apocalypse, and in some ways they 're probably aware that it's already here.\n\nThird, denial. If we deny that bad language, sexual behaviors, violence, and racism exist, then it won't. Oh, if only it were that easy! Taxes would have ceased to exist years ago. Along with traffic and those people who take 20 minutes to special order coffee at Starbucks.\n\nDenial doesn't work.\n\nThinking, arguing, discoursing work. Where do you stand on book banning? What's your favorite banned book?", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "99539cb5-363b-429c-bf32-d1b548c8b065", "url": "https://doreeweller.wordpress.com/category/observations-about-life/"}
{"text": "Eid-al-Adha Bakrid\n\nOne of the greatest festival of Islamic religion globally known as Eid al-Adha Bakrid is joyously celebrated all over the world in the remembrance of Abraham's (Ibrahim's) sacrifice. This day is also acknowledged as the \"festival of the sacrifice\" which marks the end of Hajj, the annual Islamic pilgrimage to Mecca undertaken by Muslims all over the world.\n\nBakri Eid is popularly commemorated in the memory of Abraham's willingness to sacrifice his son out of faith in Allah and Allah's mercy on us all.As son was replaced with a sheep, lamb, so these are the traditional thing to eat on Eid al-Adha. Ibrahim later sacrificed a sheep as per God's instructions. The celebration symbolizes Ibrahim's devotion to Allah. Animals like goat, sheep, cow or camel are sacrificed on this day.\n\nOn this auspicious muslim festival people visit the mosque, dressed up in their new clothes, listen to sermons and later offer Sunnah prayer of two rakats in the morning. Since it is a public celebration, Eid prayers are performed as large congregation prayers and attended by men, women and children.\n\nAfter the completion of prayers during Eid al-Adha, sacred Takbir is used to be said. Specifically, seven Takbirs are included in the first Raka'ah and five Takbirs in the second one. Muslims convey their gratefulness to Allah for enabling them to observe the rites successfully in their prayers.\n\nWords of 'Eid Mubarak' are greeted by all Muslims all over the world and offer gifts or money as 'Eidi' to children. People invite their relatives, friends, colleagues and neighbours belong to other communities to be the part of their Eid festivities including offering them their dishes and sweet delicacies. Muslims are duty-bound to share their blessings by feeding the needy and making contributions to mosques.\n\nEid-al-Adha Bakrid\n\nWhen is Eid al-Adha?\n\nTimings set for Eid celebration rely on the lunar cycle, so the festival falls on a different date every year, just as Easter does.\n\nEid-al-Adha Bakrid 2016 is on September 13 Tuesday\n\n2 days to go for the event\n\nFor more details on this festival scroll down the complete page and enjoy the wishes conveyed by our team.

{"text": "Michael Leahy, founder and executive director of Bravehearts ministry on sex addiction, has written three books on the deleterious effects of pornography. Two of his books, \"Porn Work: Exposing the Office's #1 Addiction\" and \"Porn University: What College Students Are Really Saying About Sex on Campus,\" are out this month.\n\nQuestion: The University of Maryland recently allowed a segment of a pornographic film to be shown on campus. Is there a problem here?\n\nAnswer: When institutions green-light things like this, it just continues to create a culture of normalization of pornography. Where it's going to be a real shock treatment is when [college graduates] go to work for employers who have a zero-tolerance policy on pornography. And that's pretty much all of them.\n\nQ: You have surveyed some 26,000 university students about sex. What have you found?\n\nA: We're finding that there is a lot of shame and a lot of unwanted sexual behavior, a lot of hiding of the things they do sexually. One amazing finding is that fully one in five students feels that their sexual behavior is not \"normal.\" But here's the most amazing thing about that: We never define for them what is \"normal\" sexually. So [their responses] are based on their definition of what is normal.\n\nQ: What do you think they are referring to when they say their sexual behavior is not \"normal\"?\n\nA: I don't know specifically because we didn't ask them to elaborate on their answer, but I would imagine it involves sexual behaviors that either instill guilt or a sense of shame or clearly violate their personal standards. Either way you look at it, it's alarming. I think they're coming face to face with the consequences and the hidden dangers of accepting what I call the \"faulty belief system\" that goes along with pornography and a sex-saturated culture.\n\nQ: What do you mean by \"faulty belief system\"?\n\nA: This is something I came face to face with in my recovery from my sexual addiction. A faulty belief system is any assumption or myth or belief that we hold true, but that just isn't true. For instance, there's ones that say, \"Sex is my greatest need\" or \"Porn's only about sex; using porn isn't hurting anyone; it's no big deal because it's just about sex and there's nothing wrong with that.\" Some of that is true when it's healthy sex in the context of healthy relationships, but pornography typically portrays anything but healthy sexuality in relationships. Pornography portrays the idea that … when she says \"no,\" it really means \"yes\"; if you're not satisfied, bring someone else into the marriage bed with you; group sex is perfectly acceptable, assuming it's consensual. As a result, what we're seeing now is a generation of kids who have bought into the lies and been totally desensitized to the negative impact that this will have in their real lives.\n\nQ: What else did your survey of university students show?\n\nA: The survey showed that less than 1 percent of college students are sexually addicted, which does not surprise me.\n\nQ: Why no surprise?\n\nA: It's because sexual addiction takes hold when one of two things happen. One, when you go to work for an employer who doesn't tolerate you sitting there, cruising porn on your lunch hour on the company computer, the company network. And two, when you get into a committed relationship with another person who generally doesn't share your views on pornography. And that almost always happens a couple years out of college [when the man marries or starts having an exclusive relationship with a woman]. This is when men and women both start hiding their guilty pleasures; this one in particular can easily escalate over time into a full-blown addiction.\n\nQ: Is it hard to stop a porn habit?\n\nA: We find that there's a general sense that people believe they can just walk away from this material when they need to or when they want to. But while they've been in college, there's been no impetus for them to stop. So, the key is, when they have to stop, what will they do?\n\nI believe there is a percentage of people who will be able to stop. Another percentage - the majority - won't want to stop and will continue to view it in secret.\n\nAnd then there are those who will develop some real problematic, unwanted sexual behaviors. They won't be able to stop even when they want to, and they will become fully sexually addicted - that's the estimated 6 percent to 8 percent of the general population who is sexually addicted. Most of these people will have invested most of their time with Internet pornography, which we refer to as the \"crack cocaine of sexual addiction\" because it's just not that easy to stop.\n\nQ: You were just in Eastern and Central Europe talking to college students. Europe is much more liberal about pornography and sexual mores. What did you find there?\n\nA: Europe is a few years further down the road than the U.S., as far as their mainstreaming of pornography into the general culture, the mainstreaming of these \"faulty beliefs,\" if you will.\n\nIn general, in the former Eastern Bloc countries I visited, I found that many women tend to dress much more provocatively than women here. The men are much more objectifying, and the women have just accepted it. It's like the worst nightmare of the early feminist movement - where women are totally sexualized, they are only valued based on their sexuality (body shape and size and physicality).\n\nQ: Did the European students differ from American students in their opinions about pornography?\n\nA: I had a lot of women come up and tell me they're in such messed-up relationships. They said the culture basically reinforces the guys' views and the faulty belief systems of porn, which is that it's all about pleasing a man sexually.\n\nSo European students are just as paralyzed in their ability to experience healthy intimacy in relationships as the students over here. But over there, there's more of a feeling of hopelessness, more of a sense of just giving in.\n\nI just find it amazing that American college students continue to bring up this [argument] that \"Porn is more accepted in Europe\" and \"They have more liberated sexual views, so we're just puritanistic; what's wrong with us\" and \"We should be more like Europe, that they have less sexual violence and crime than we do\" - claims that I've never heard a single student back up with evidence.\n\nAnd I say to them, \"You don't want to be more like Europe\" when it comes to relationships.", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "24035024-b8aa-4b7a-9485-dc19e4f0e732", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2009/apr/23/when-students-meet-porn/"}
{"text": "Retinal detachment is a very serious eye condition that happens when the retina separates from the tissue around it. Since the retina can't work properly under these conditions, you could permanently lose vision if the detached retina isn't repaired promptly.\n\nWho's at Risk for a Detached Retina?\n\nRetinal tears -- although different than retinal detachment -- are often the first stage leading to a retinal detachment. If fluid from within the eye passes through a retinal tear, that can separate the retina from its underlying tissue -- and that's retinal detachment. Retinal detachment may happen with no warning, but often there are retinal tear \"warning\" symptoms of flashes and floaters. If treated during the stage of retinal tear and before full detachment, a simple office laser procedure prevents the need for a more serious retinal detachment operation.\n\nIf you are unsure about your risk of retinal detachment, talk to your eye doctor.\n\nWhat Are the Symptoms of a Detached Retina?\n\nIf you notice any of those symptoms, contact your eye doctor immediately.\n\nHow Is a Detached Retina Diagnosed?\n\nYour eye doctor would give you an eye exam, which would include dilating your eyes. That lets them see if your retina is detached.\n\nEarly diagnosis is key to preventing vision loss from a detached retina.\n\nContinued\n\nHow Is a Detached Retina Treated?\n\nThere are many ways to treat a detached retina. These include:\n\nLaser (thermal) or freezing (cryopexy). Both of these approaches can repair a tear in the retina if it is diagnosed early enough. This procedure is often done in the doctor's office.\n\nPneumatic retinopexy. This procedure can be used to treat retinal detachment if the tear is small and easy to close. A small gas bubble is injected into the eye (specifically into the clear, gel-like substance between the lens and the retina), where it then rises and presses against the retina, closing the tear. A laser or cryopexy can then be used to seal the tear.\n\nScleral buckle. This treatment for retinal detachment involves surgically sewing a silicone band (buckle) around the white of the eye (called the sclera) to push the sclera toward the tear until the tear heals. This band is not visible and remains permanently attached. Laser or cryo treatment may then be necessary to seal the tear.\n\nVitrectomy. This surgery for retinal detachment is used for large tears. During a vitrectomy, the doctor removes the vitreous (the clear, gel-like substance between eye's lens and retina) and replaces it with a saline solution.\n\nDepending on the complexity of the retinal detachment, various combinations of vitrectomy, buckle, laser and gas bubble may be used to repair the retina.\n\nCan a Detached Retina Be Prevented?\n\nYes, in some cases. Make sure you see an eye doctor immediately if you develop new floaters, flashing lights or any change in your vision. Early is always better than later in treating retinal tears, detachments and other serious issues.\n\nGetting an eye exam can flag early changes in your eyes that you may not have noticed. Treating those changes can help.\n\nYou should get your eyes checked once a year, or more often if you have conditions such as diabetes that make you more likely to have eye disease. Regular eye exams are also important if you are very nearsighted, as nearsightedness makes retinal detachment more likely.\n\nContinued\n\nNot sure how often you should get your eyes checked? Ask your eye doctor.\n\nYou should also use the appropriate eye protection for certain activities. For instance, you should wear sports goggles with polycarbonate lenses while playing racquetball or certain other sports. You may also need eye protection if you work with machines, chemicals, or tools at work or home.", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "767d0f08-8bb4-479a-8a8d-5547da8eb0ca", "url": "http://www.webmd.com/eye-health/eye-health-retinal-detachment"}

Vaccines hold great promise as potential treatments for all types of ...\n\nCHICAGO Researchers at Northwestern Brain Tumor Institute (NBTI) are seeking to understand if a vaccine made from a patient's own blood cells may slow the growth of a type of brain tumor. The trial is studying the vaccine's effect on glioblastoma multiformes (GBM), the most common and aggressive type of primary brain tumor. The trial is an example of a growing trend in cancer research that seeks to understand if vaccines can be used to turn a person's own immune system into a weapon against cancers by slowing the growth of tumors.\n\nGBMs, which occur in up to 10,000 Americans annually, are typically treated with surgical resection of the tumor followed by chemotherapy and radiation treatment. \"Glioblastomas are complicated to treat because they are aggressive, fast-growing tumors that are often resistant to standard treatment,\" said principal investigator James Chandler, MD, co-director of the NBTI and surgical director of neuro-oncology at Northwestern Memorial Hospital. \"In this trial, a vaccine is made using the person's own white blood cells, which we hope will have the power to stimulate an immune response to kill brain tumor cells.\"\n\nThe vaccine, called ICT-107, is created by collecting the participant's white blood cells through a process called apheresis, which separates the components in the blood. The white blood cells are then treated to recognize the tumor cells turning them into immune cells, which early research indicates may be able to recognize and attack the tumor cells. Patients receive the vaccine in addition to standard treatment.\n\n\"Vaccines hold great promise as potential treatments for all types of cancer,\" said Chandler, who is also a professor of neurological surgery at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine. \"More researchers are looking at this as a way to prompt an immune response to slow tumor growth and fight the cancer.\"\n\nThe phase II trial will examine both safety and efficacy of the ICT-107 vaccine. Researchers seek to enroll approximately 225 participants nationally who are newly diagnosed with a GBM. To be considered for enrollment, a person must be 18 years or older and not have a recurrent disease or any other active malignancy or history of malignancy. They must have undergone surgery to excise the GBM, but have not yet started chemotherapy or radiation. Full inclusion and exclusion criteria can be found on ClinicalTrials.gov.\n\n\"GBMs are a devastating diagnosis and these patients unfortunately are not given a great deal of time,\" said Chandler. \"Our goal at Northwestern Brain Tumor Institute is to provide patients with the best options to treat their cancer in a manner that not only gives them longer lives, but also improved quality of life", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "ed358c4b-31a0-4180-9592-ed0ba7b1df67", "url": "http://www.bio-medicine.org/medicine-news-1/Researchers-study-vaccine-as-potential-weapon-against-aggressive-brain-tumors-92955-1/"}

However, teachers\nunderstanding).\nare lucky to have students on task for\n600hours of acquisition.\nMost language acquisition studies deal\nwith first-language acquisition. A baby\nmay acquire language 10 hours a day for 6\nWe must make every minute count.\nFocus on Fluency\nTo focus on fluency, we teach stories. Fluency comes by:\nStudents focusing on the details of a story.\nStudents not focusing on the language.\nStudents picking up the language unconsciously.\nWhat is TPRS®?\nTPRS® is a method of second-language teaching that uses highly-interactive stories to provide\ncomprehensible input and create immersion in the classroom.\nKey 1: COMPREHENSION\nComprehension is a function of the following:\n1. Using vocabulary students know. Whenwe use a word they don\"t know, we write it on the\nboard with translation.\n2. Speaking slowly enough to allow students to process what we\"re saying.\n3. Continually editing our speech, making sure students know every word we use.\n-1-\n\n2.\nTPRSTORYTELLING®\nKey 2: Repetition\nRepetition is directly linked to comprehension. As we learn to be repetitive, the comprehension of our\nstudents will increase. TPRS®makes the language repetitive in the following ways:\n1. Asking repetitive questions, or \"circling\".\n2. Going back and reviewing storyline. We review by asking questions. As we ask questions, the\nrole of the students is to answer the questions. The review allows the students to process the\nlanguage faster, thus increasing their confidence in understanding the oral language.\n3. Adding details to a sentence one at a time. Once we add a new detail, we review it by asking\nquestions.\n4. Using multiple locations. Multiple locations allow for variety in the storyline. Our goal is to\nlimit the amount of new vocabulary in order increase comprehension (this is especially\nimportant with beginning students).\n5. Using multiple characters. Multiple charactersenhance interest.Multiple characters allow us to\nask a lot of questions by comparing and contrasting one character with the other(s). This\nallows us to practice the same details in creative ways.\n6. Verifying the details to the class and with our actors. To verify a detail means to repeat the\ncorrect answer after the students answer a question. We do the same process of asking\nquestions & verifying details with the student actor(s). This will build confidence in our\nstudents because it will allow them to hear the language more. Verifying the details with the\nactor(s) will also teach the students the other forms of the verbs used correctly and in context.\nKey 3: Interest\nWe make the class interesting by:\n1. Surprise details. We add details to stories by telling the students a new detail or by asking a\nquestion and having them guess. As the students guess, we have the option of taking their\nsuggestions. We encourage them by telling them to try to surprise us with their responses. As\nyou model \"surprise\" details as a teacher, your students will learn to be more creative and will\nin turn contribute surprise details.\n2. Game playing. Since students are trying to surprise us, they are competing to get their surprise\ndetail in the story. This game or competition doesn\"t get old.\n3. Personalization. We personalize our stories based on the culture of our students. We learn\ndetails about our students and inject them into our stories.\n4. Positive exaggeration. We always make our students look good. We add celebrities to our\nstories so we can compare our students to the celebrities. Our students always look better\nthan the celebrities.\n5. Dramatization and dialogue. By acting out storylines and events and adding dialogue, student\ninterest is enhanced. The better the acting, the more interesting it will be.\nTeach to the Eyes\n1. Teach students not curriculum. TPRS® emphasizes that students set the pace of the class not\n-2-\n\n3.\nTPRSTORYTELLING®\nthe curriculum. In TPRS® we practice for mastery instead of covering curriculum.\n2. Look in individual students\" eyes when teaching. Looking in their eyes is a way to connect\nwith students and to assess whether communication is taking place.\n3. Hold students accountable by having them answer by questions.\n4. Always check for understanding. When we see a student who isn\"t answering the questions,\nwe call him/her by name and ask him/her the question individually.\nStory Retells\nHave students frequently retell stories\n1. Have all students retell the story to partners at the end of the story.\n2. Choose a superstar to retell to the class.\n3. Limit retells to 2 or 3 minutes.\n4. Have them retell to an adult at night.\nShelter Vocabulary\nThe average two-year old has a vocabulary of about 300 words and the average three-year old\nhas a vocabulary of about 900 words. Mr. Sandman (answers@yahoo.com) says we only\nneed about 400 to 500 words in everyday speech. Mark Davies in Spanish Frequency\nDictionary said the 50 most common words in Spanish make up 60% of the language and the\ntop 1000 words make up 85% of the language. We therefore limit the vocabulary we teach to\na few hundred words. Limiting vocabulary is the only way we can be repetitive enough for\nour students to learn to speak.\nDon\"t Shelter Grammar\nIn TPRS® we teach grammar as vocabulary. Grammar is taught through meaning by getting\nstudents to feel the grammar. We try not to shelter tenses or structures. We introduce\nwhatever tense or structure is necessary to tell our story.\nWe always start out our beginning classes in the past tense. We also have them do readings in\nthe present tense. This gives our students continual practice in both the present and past\ntenses. We use other tenses when needed for whatever meaning we want to teach.Our\nstudents focus on the details of the story, not the language. Students pick up the structures\nunconsciously.\nLearning the structures by feel is the key to learning how to speak a\nlanguage.\nBarb Watson\"s Study\nBarb Watson did a study where she compared a TPRS® teacher with a textbook teacher. She\nfilmed both teachers for one hour at four different intervals throughout the year. She studied\nthe teachers and saw that the TPRS® teacher asked questions and the other teacher did not.\nShe found the TPRS® teacher asked about 4 questions a minute.\nThe other teacher didn\"t ask questions but did use the vocabulary words. He used them an\naverage of 11 times a class period.\nIn Barb\"s study,TPRS® students scored slightly better on a district final exam, and one\nstandard deviation above the control group. The TPRS® group was at the 86th percentile in\nfluency while the other group was at the 50th percentile.\n-3-\n\n4.\nTPRSTORYTELLING®\nBarb found the TPRS® students were generally not confident they would score well on the\ndistrict test. The control group students in surveys displayed more confidence.It was\nsurprising to see the TPRS® students score better.\nIn TPRS® we try to ask our student 4-8 questions (and statements) per minute. That would\nbe over 400 questions/statements per hour and 50,000 to 80,000 questions/statements per\nyear.\nCL Classroom: Question Words\n16\n14\n12\n10\nNumber of\nQuestions 8\nquestions\n6\n4\n2\n0\n:00 :04 :08 :12 :16 :20 :24 :28 :32 :36 :40 :44 :48\nTime Intervals\nThis is the chart of the TPRS® teacher in Barb\"s study.\nnumber of repeats\nTraditional Classroom:\nVocabulary repetitions\n6\n4\n2\nSeries1\n0\n:00 :04 :08 :12 :16 :20 :24 :28 :32 :36 :40 :44 :48\nTime intervals\nThis is a chart of the control group teacher in Barb\"s study.\n-4-\n\n5.\nBrain Rules by Jon Medina\nBrain Rules\n1. We don\"t pay attention to boring things. 2. We have 30 seconds to repeat something before it\nis forgotten. 3. Students must pay attention in order to learn. We get them to pay attention\nwith novel, distinctive or unpredictable stimuli. We also use emotions. 4. Most of what we\nlearn is visual. Since people usually forget 90% of what they learn in class within 30 days, we\nhave to use long-term memory teaching techniques to get students to remember. To help\nthem remember, we dramatize the story and use props like wigs, fake hats, stuffed animals,\nand cardboard cutouts. 5. The initial learning is important, but we can increase the lifespan of\na memory simply by repeating it in timed intervals.\nThere are two types of memories – declarative and non-declarative.\nDeclarative memory is learning facts. Eg\"Jupiter is a planet\" or \"The shirt is blue.\"\nNon-declarative memory is something learned by feel. Sports, music, art, driving, riding a\nbike, and learning to speak a language are examples of non-declarative memories.\nLearning the rules of language is a declarative memory. Learning to speak a language is a nondeclarative memory. In language teaching, learning about language and learning to speak a language\nare two largely unrelated skills.Information is best remembered when it is elaborate, meaningful and\nin context. Specific details increase the chance of long term memory.\nTPRS® Procedures\nThere are three procedures inTPRS®: The teacher says the following.\nProcedure 1:When I make a statement you will respond with an expression of interest. It\nsounds like this: OHHHHHHHHHH. We give the students a visual cue to remind them to respond\nwith an expression of interest. One possible visual cue is for the teacher to raise his hands. When\nsomething negative happens, we react in a negative way. We may say \"Oh no, oh no, that\"s terrible!\"\nand have the student do the same.\nFor variety, students can also make comments like, \"marvelous\", \"wonderful\", \"fabulous\", \"wow\",\n\"amazing,\" \"How terrible\" or \"I can\"t believe it.\"\nProcedure 2: When I ask a question and the answer is known, your job is to answer out loud\nand in the target language.\nThis is a key procedure in the TPRS class. The primary purpose of asking questions is to get the\nstudents responding chorally. Their responding to our questions is evidence that they understand.\nProcedure 3: When I ask a question and the answer is not known, your job is to guess.These\nare the student rules for guessing:\n-5-\n\n6.\nTPRSTORYTELLING®\na. You must guess in the target language.\nb. You can guess though with English proper nouns if the question allows for a proper noun.\nc. When you guess, surprise me. If you don\"t surprise me, I will surprise you.\nCircling: The Heart of TPRS®\nTPRS® uses repetitive questions. It is our way to practice the language. We circle to build\nconfidence. No one learns with one or two repetitions. We only learn with extensive repetitions.\nThe two primary purposes of circling are: 1) getting the students to respond to our questions\nchorally, & 2) building fluency. If they hear the language enough and it is comprehensible to their\nbrains, speech will emerge.\nBelow is a circling model.\n1.\n2.\n3.\n4.\n5.\n6.\n7.\nMake a statement.\nQuestion with a yes answer. ( Verify)\nAsk either/or questions. (Verify)\nQuestion with a \"no\" answer.\nRestate the negative and restate the positive.\nAsk: who? (Verify)\nAsk: what? where? when? how much? how many? why? how?\n(Use the one that fits.) (Verify)\nWhen you circle:\n1. Circle in any order. Don\"t follow the above order. (Always going in the same order is\npredictable and therefore boring.)\n2. Circle a different part of the sentence, called a variable (i.e. subject, verb, compliment, etc).\nEach variable has many alternatives. Think about several different alternatives with each\nvariable. Mixing up variables and alternatives allows for variety as we ask repetitive\nquestions.\n3. Ask higher level questions, which are those that begin with the question words. These\nquestions may result in slower processing. If they do, we want to slow down our speech\nand/or point to give the students extra time to process the question.\n4. Add a detail. Do this by telling the class the new information or asking them a question and\nletting them guess. Circle the new detail.\n5. Add another character and compare and contrast the two characters.\n6. Do any combination of the above.\n-6-\n\n7.\nTPRSTORYTELLING®\n\"Circling\" Template\nStatement: Mildred started dancing in the park.\nCircle the subject\nAnswer with yes________________________________________________(Verify)\nEither/or______________________________________________________(Verify)\nAnswer with a no________________________(Restate the negative and verify positive)\nQuestion word_________________________________________________(Verify)\nCircle the verb\nAnswer with yes________________________________________________(Verify)\nEither/or______________________________________________________(Verify)\nAnswer with a no________________________(Restate the negative and verify positive)\nQuestion word_________________________________________________(Verify)\nCircle the compliment\nAnswer with yes________________________________________________(Verify)\nEither/or______________________________________________________(Verify)\nAnswer with a no________________________(Restate the negative and verify positive)\nQuestion word_________________________________________________(Verify)\nGet a new statement by asking when\nAnswer with yes________________________________________________(Verify)\nEither/or______________________________________________________(Verify)\nAnswer with a no________________________(Restate the negative and verify positive)\nQuestion word_________________________________________________(Verify)\nAdd a parallel character (Brutus started dancing in school.)\nAnswer with yes________________________________________________(Verify)\nEither/or______________________________________________________(Verify)\nAnswer with a no________________________(Restate the negative and verify positive)\nQuestion word_________________________________________________(Verify)\nHow to start a story\nWhenever we start an oral story, we write some key phrases on the board with translation. These are\nthe structures that we want to practice with several questions. We either ask for a volunteer to be the\nactor or select a good actor. We then start the story. We first introduce a character by making a\nstatement (e.g., Class, there was a girl.). We ask some circling questions about that statement. We add\na detail by telling the class the name of the girl (e.g., The girl was Elena.). We ask circling questions\nto the class with this sentence. In addition to asking questions to the class, we ask questions to the\nstudent actor.\n-7-\n\n8.\nTPRSTORYTELLING®\nThe suggested model is to ask the questions to the class in the past tense and to the student actor in\nthe present tense. Mixing tenses allows student to acquire both tenses and it will happen over time.\nWe focus on the following as we \"ask a story\":\nAdding details one at a time by telling the class the new detail or by asking a question and\nletting the class guess.\nAsking circling questions about the new detail(s) (the role of the student is to answer the\nquestions).\nAs the students answer the questions chorally, we focus on verifying the details.\nAsk the student actor(s) questions in the present tense.\nWe continue this process by adding details one at a time and focusing on the above skills.\nBelow is a sample of the process:\nTeacher speaking to:\nClase\n(PAST)\n(PRESENT)\nClase, Elena era unachica.\nClass, Elena was a girl.\nTeacher speaking to:\nStudent\n¿Eresunachica? (Are you a girl?)\nSí, eresunachica. (Yes, you are a girl.)\nClase, Elena era unachica. (Class, Elena was a girl.)\nClase, ¿dóndeestaba Elena? (Class, where was Elena?)\nElena estaba en ... (Elena was in _________)\n¿Dóndeestás? (Where are you?)\nSí, estás en …. (Yes, you are in __________.)\nClase, Elena estaba en … (Class, Elena was in __________.)\nClase, ¿dóndeestaba Elena en …? (Class, where was Elena in _________?)\n-8-\n\n9.\nTPRSTORYTELLING®\nElena estaba en … , … (Elena was in ____________.)\n¿Dóndeestás en …? (Where are you in _________?)\nSi, estás en … , ...\n(Yes, you are in ___________.)\nClase, Elena estaba en … , …. (Class, Elena was in ____________.)\nClase, ¿dóndeestaba Elena en … , … (Class, where was Elena in ___________?)\nElena estaba en …, … , ... (Elena was in _____________.)\n¿Dóndeestås en … , …? (Where are you in ________?)\nSí, estás en … , … , … (Yes, you are in _________.)\nClase, Elena estaba en … , … , … (Class, Elena was in ________________.)\nClase, Elena era chicanúmerouno. (Class, Elena wa girl number one.)\n¿Ereschicanúmerouno? (Are you girl number one?)\nSí, ereschicanúmerouno. (Yes, you are\ngirl number one.)\nClase, Elena era chicanumerouno. (Class, Elena was girl number one.)\nClase, ¿quién era chicanúmero dos?(Class, who was girl number two?)\n…. era chicanúmero dos. (_____________ was girl number two.)\nAt any point we can add a parallel character. We add a parallel character in the same way that we add\na new detail, either by telling the class the new information or by asking them a question and letting\nthem guess. Once we\"ve added a new character, we can go through the same process of asking\nquestions & verifying details both to the class and with the new character.\n-9-\n\n10.\nTPRSTORYTELLING®\nFirst part of story: Background information\nA story consists of two parts. The first part is background information. The second part is a set\nstoryline that includes a problem, three locations, and a resolution. The background information\ndoesn\"t have to be related to the second part of the story. Background information can include any of\nthe following:\nAny information about the main character. E.g..his/her name, physical description, personality\ntype, likes/dislikes, where he/she lives, what he/she did last week, etc.\nAny additional information about the setting. E.g. time of day, the weather, day of the week,\nholiday, seasons, etc.\nParallel characters and information about them. The parallel characters can include national or\nlocal celebrities, students playing the role of themselves, animals, or even inanimate objects.\nStudents play the role of the parallel characters.\nActing out an \"event\". As we add details to our background information or stories, our goal is\nto show the information by acting it out. We call this extra storyline an event.\nOne purpose of adding background information is to allow the teacher to \"slow down\" and focus on\ngiving the student more repetitions of the basics of the language, rather than adding more storyline.\nBy being more repetitive with the basic structures of the language, the students will build fluency.\nWith beginners, this means that they will learn a lot of the most frequent verbs of the language and be\nable to produce them. It is only by practicing those verbs with a lot of repetitive questions that the\nproduction will emerge.\nFor teachers teaching classes ranging from 30 to 55 minutes, the suggested model is to teach the\nbackground information on the first day and the second part of the story on the next day. For teachers\nteaching longer classes, both parts could take place in the same day.\nSecond part of story: Problem, 3 locations, & resolution\nPart 2: The Problem\nLocation 1: Introduce the problem\nThe problem comes after the background information. For teachers teaching shorter class periods (30\nto 55 minutes), this would take place on day 2. Before introducing the problem, we want to review\nyesterday\"s background information for a few minutes. Once the review ends, the story now focuses\non the main character rather than a parallel character. Every story has a problem. A problem can be\nsomething as simple as a boy or a girl wanting a cat (or something else). We introduce the problem\n- 10 -\n\n11.\nTPRSTORYTELLING®\nin the first location of the story by telling the class what the character wanted or by asking the class\nwhat the character wanted and they guess. If we like a suggestion from the class, then we could take\ntheir answer and it would become the correct answer in the story. We can add additional details about\nthe thing that the character wanted by either telling the students the new information or by asking\nthem questions and having them guess. Whenever we say something that the students do not know,\nwe write it on the board with translation in order to ensure 100% comprehension. We circle these\nnew details by asking questions to the class and to the student actor.\nLocation 2: Unsuccessful attempt to resolve the problem\nThe character goes to a new location. The problem will not be resolved in this location. Since the new\nlocation is a new detail, we add the new location in the same way that we add a new detail, by either\ntelling the class the new detail or by asking them and letting them guess. Once we establish the new\ndetail by saying \"(name of character) went to X\", we have the student actor physically go to a\ndifferent area in our room that represents the new location. Once they\"re in the new location, we want\nto dramatize the storyline in the new location with dialogue. For example, if the story were about a\ngirl who wanted a cat, the dramatization could look like this:\nClass, in Las Vegas, there was a boy. (We then get a boy in the class to play the role of the boy). The\ngirl said to him, \"Hi boy! I want a cat. Do you have an extra cat?\"\nThe boy said to the girl, \"Hi girl. I\"m sorry but I do not have an extra cat.\"\nThe girl was not happy. She cried.\nOur job is to give the student actors their lines and have them repeat them. If there is any doubt as to\nwhether or not the class understands the dialogue, we translate the lines. We coach the actors to be\nmelodramatic and enthusiastic actors. If they are, then the class will be very engaged and entertained.\nLocation 3: Successful attempt to resolve the problem\nThe character goes to a third location (same process as before). The problem will be resolved in this\nlocation. Once he\"s in the new location, we dramatize the storyline in this location with dialogue.\nFor example:\nClass, the girl went to PetSmart in New Orleans. In PetSmart, there was a boy (We get a boy in the\nclass to play the role of this boy.) The girl said to him, \"Hi boy! I want a cat. Do you have an extra\ncat?\"\nThe boy said to the girl, \"Hi girl. I have 3 cats. I have 2 cats for me and an extra cat for you.\"\nThe boy gave the girl the cat. The girl was happy. She held up her cat and yelled, \"I have a cat. I am\nhappy now!\"\n- 11 -\n\n12.\nTPRSTORYTELLING®\nThe story ends when the problem is resolved. If we have extra time, we can do any of the following:\nReview any of the storyline by asking questions. This will give the students extra repetitions.\nAct it out again but this time add one or more surprise details.\nAdd new details to the story by asking or telling.\nAdd one or more parallel character(s) and add contrasting details. Act out the storyline with\nthe parallel character(s).\nAct out an event.\nStudent retells.\nTPRS®Lesson Plan\nPart 1: Background information:\nSelect some fluency structures that your students need to practice. Write these in your lesson plan\n(these will be written on the board): _________________________________________________\nList several questions to establish the background information. Include possible surprise answers. Do\nthe same thing for one or more parallel characters. Plan one or more events.Plan dramatization and\ndialogue for the characters.\nPart 2: Problem, 3 locations, & resolution\nProblem: _____________________________________________________________________\nTwo or three practice structures 1. _______________________2.________________________\nLocation 1.The story now shifts to the main character.

Add the embedded readings\non Wednesday. By then the students are familiar with the new structures.\nFirst embedded reading\nChorally translate the first two embedded readings. Teacher reads a sentence in the target\nlanguage and the students chorally translate it.\nStudents sit in pairs in groups of six or eight. Student one reads the first sentence in the target\nlanguage. Student two translates the first sentence and reads the second sentence in the target\nlanguage. Students alternate reading and translating in this manner to the end of the story.\n(Volleyball translation) Students do volleyball translation for 3 minutes and then change partners.\nStudents change partners 3 or four times. (Students do volleyball translation for about 9 to 12\nminutes with 3 or 4 different partners.)\n- 13 -\n\n14.\nTPRSTORYTELLING®\nDramatize and Discuss the Extended Reading\nOur objective is to spend two class periods (30-55 minutes) on the readings (embedded readings &\nextended reading) or a full block period (90 minutes).\nEvery student has a copy of the extended reading. Our goal is to make the readings more interesting.\nThere are several ways to do so. One option is to add background information before you chorally\ntranslate any of the reading with your students. A second option is to translate some or all of the first\nparagraph and then do any of the following:\nCircling questions\nAdd background information\nAdd surprise details\nAdd one or more parallel characters\nPQA (Personalized questions & answers)\nAct out an event\nDramatize the storyline with student actors. If the story has dialogue, then the student\nactors would say their lines. If there isn't dialogue, you could add dialogue.\nThe process of asking circling questions to the class and student actor(s) is part of this process. Our\nobjective is to identify some fluency structures that the students need to hear more in order to\nimprove their speech. We want to include questions using those key phrases so that students are 1)\nanswering the questions chorally, and 2) building fluency through comprehensible input.\nAs you go through the reading paragraph by paragraph and make the readings more interesting by\ndoing the above skills, your readings will take a lot of time. The last thing we will do with the reading\n(the last 10-15 minutes of the allotted time) is the following:\nChorally translate the entire extended reading and dramatize it with student actors. Then follow\nthe volleyball translation pattern used in the embedded readings with the entire extended reading.\nYou can do this for just the present tense reading or for the reading in the present and in the past.\nIf there is additional time, doa student retell.\nAs we add surprise details to either the oral stories, extended readings, or novels, our goal is to act\nout \"events\". An event is a tool of creativity that can be used anytime.\nEVENT:\nAllows us to \"show it\" rather than just \"talk about it.\" TPRS is a much better product when\n- 14 -\n\n15.\nTPRSTORYTELLING®\nour students are able to \"see\" the stories.\nThis is \"extra information\" that wasn\"t part of the original story. It could be viewed as a \"side\nstory\" or \"tangent\" to the central storyline.\nAn event starts once the teacher decides that s/he has enough \"interesting information\". This\ncould be after one detail, after a few details, or after several details have been added.\nAn event starts by the teacher saying \"One day . . . \" At this point we ask for student actor(s).\nSaying \"One day . . . \" narrows our focus to a specific time period.\nSince the focus of the event is the dramatization, circling plays a minor role. We typically\ncircle less or not at all during an event. Once the event is over, the student actors sit down and\nthen we ask some circling questions.\nGoal is to use 95% of words that they already know.\nAs the event evolves, additional details are added by the teacher telling the new details or\nasking questions and having the class guess.\nDramatize whatever can be dramatized. Add dialogue. Dramatization & dialogue is HIGH\nINTEREST.\nEvents can be planned, improvised, or a combination of the two.\nEvents get more elaborate as students learn more language. They are simpler with beginning\nstudents because they know less language.\nA short event could take as little as 5 minutes. A longer event could take as a half hour or\neven longer.\nA Typical TPRS® Week\nMonday\n1. Talk in Spanish about the students\" weekends.\n2. Use PQA -- personalized questions and answers. Ask students questions about their lives\nusing vocabulary or phrases listed on the board that will be used in the story.\n3. Start the ask-a-story. Establish characters and add whatever background information\nyouwant. Add surprise details and make general details more specific.\nTuesday\n1. Review the background information from yesterday\"s story.Add any other background\ninformation you want. Add other proper nouns and surprise details. Constantly verify the\ndetails with the class and with your actors.\n2. Introduce a problem where the main characters need or want something.\n3. Attempt to solve the problem. Sometimes, change something about the problem so it can\"t be\nsolved.\n4. Finally, solve the problem, which means your actor gets what he/she wanted.\nWednesday\n1. Chorally translate embedded readings one and two. Students write in words they don\"t know.\n2. Volleyball translation in groups of two. Rotate 3 or 4 times.\n3. Add background information and parallel characters. Add lots of surprise details about the\nreading and parallel characters.\n- 15 -\n\n16.\nTPRSTORYTELLING®\n4. Add specific, surprise details and proper nouns to the story.\nThursday\n1. Review all the details from yesterday.\n2. Add more surprise details to the story and about your characters.\n3. Dramatize the rest of the story.\n4. Read and discuss the rest of the story.\n5. Chorally translate the entire extended reading. Students write in words they don\"t know.\n6. Volleyball translation with the either one or two of the extended readings.\n7. If there is time, do a student retell.\nFriday\n1. Do a timed writing.\n2. Follow all of the steps of the extended reading with a novel.\nGRADING\n1. 50% Tests (Unannounced!) Test are vocabulary translation tests. They are cumulative. Test words\nthey know.\n2. 25% - Daily Work. This includes any non-test grade. These include timed writings, quizzes and\nhomework. Homework includes retelling the story to an adult or doing something with the story\nsuch as rewriting the story, writing a new version of the story or drawing out the story.\n(Reading option.(10% of the final grade. Grading is then 40% of final grade.) First and second year\nstudents read a novel every nine weeks. Third year students read a novel every month. Fourth year\nstudents read 2000 words (10 pages) of literature a night. All students turn in double entry journals\nwhere they copy from the chapter and then write a one page reaction about what they wrote or what\nthey were reading.)\n3. 25% - Participation. In order to participate there is:\na. No social talking, writing or sleeping.\nAll students begin with a 100-point nine-week participation grade. They receive a 5-point deduction\ncalled a \"Págame\" (\"Pay Me\") infraction. Your goal is to have perfect follow through. NEVER allow\nstudents to socially talk in your class.\nPágames:\n1. Each student starts with 100 points for a nine-week period.\n2. There is one rule:\na. No social talking, no sleeping and no writing.\n3. Violating this rule causes a student to lose 5 points.\n- 16 -\n\n17.\nTPRSTORYTELLING®\n4. The teacher keeps a list of students\" names on the podium in front of the class so he/she can mark\ndown the infractions.\n5. Students get 4 free makeups. The first 2 are made up by making the teacher a card. (The card can\nsay anything and be in English or the target language. I tell them to write something nice about\nmy class or me.) The second makeup is by giving me a handshake. So they get 4 free (easy to\nmake up) págames.\n6. After the four free ones, students make up págames by writing 100-word essays. Each essay\nmakes up one págame.\n7. Maximum two págames per day. On the 3rdpágame, the student goes to the office or sits in the\nhall.\n8. The teacher should have a pat answer if students talk back: \"Make it up.\" If the teacher needs to\nadd anything else, he/she might add, \"I am not asking you to cut off your hand. It is easy to make\nit up and besides I gave you four free ones.\"\n9. Be sure to get across the idea that this is a positive system, not a negative one. Students get an\neasy way to earn 100% participation. It is available to anyone in the class. It is easy. If anyone\nsuggests the system is negative, remind them it is only negative for the students who don\"t make\nthem up.\n10. Be sure you don\"t use págames for discipline. Págames are not for throwing paper, leaving one\"s\nchair, or other disciplinary infractions. They are only for a lack of participation.\n11. Give págames with a lighthearted voice. \"Juanito, págame.\" Be sure to make your voice go up.\nNever express anger with págames.\nUSING THE STUDENT WORKBOOKS\nstory book and teach all of the mini-stories in\nchapter two.

Now another group of physicists has the answer: a complex interaction between the electric field, the cell container and the liquid causes water to move along the cell wall. Crucially, it moves in opposite directions on opposite sides of the cell and so sets up a circular flow.

{"text": "Biodiesel: Is it worth it? Can we make it worth it?\n\nPosted by :Clay Clark On : October 7, 2013\n\n0\n\nCategory:Uncategorized\n\nGraduate Student Joe Magliocca\n\nAs anybody who drives has noticed, the price of oil has increased continuously (except the major drop in late 2008) over the past 15 years, and almost continuously over the past 40 years. This price increase has increased interest in alternative fuels. Biofuels make up one category of these alternative fuels.\n\nBiofuels are broadly defined as any fuel that is derived from a recently living organism. By this definition, biofuels are not new. People have been burning wood and animal fat for thousands of years. Of course, these are not the biofuels being discussed today–unless someone wants to build a car that runs on wood or lard! Usually, modern biofuels consist of alcohols, derived from sugars, starches, and cellulose, or as fatty acid esters (biodiesel), derived from plant lipids (and occasionally animal lipids–like lard!).\n\nThere are many advantages and disadvantages to using biofuels. They are cleaner, highly renewable, and come from relatively cheap sources. They also do not add carbon to the carbon cycle, although their use does not remove the carbon from the cycle that has been added by 150-200 years of fossil fuel use. On the other hand, biofuel production often increases food prices, and switching to the large scale use of biofuels would initially be costly. Also, the cost of producing the biofuels can equal or even exceed the value of the energy produced.\n\nBiodiesel is usually more cost effective than bioethanol, and it has some unique advantages and disadvantages. Biodiesel is a mixture of esters (check wikipedia if you don't remember your organic chemistry) made from fatty acids and a small alcohol, usually methanol that can be used as fuel for a diesel engine (but NOT a gasoline engine!). Biodiesel is chemically similar to petrodiesel, but it doesn't have as many sulfur containing impurities that cause acid rain. It does have some physical and chemical differences from petrodiesel, including higher density, viscosity, flash point, heat of combustion and cloud point. These can effect engine performance, but these effects can be reduced by blending biodiesel and petrodiesel fuels together. B-20, 20% biodiesel and 80% petrodiesel by volume is commonly sold in Europe.\n\nThe reaction that produces biodiesel from vegetable oil is called transesterification. This reaction requires one of three catalysts to proceed: acid-catalyzed, base-catalyzed, and lipase-catalyzed. Acid-catalyzed transesterification doesn't work very well; it takes a long time and produces many side reactions. Base-catalyzed is currently most commonly used at an industrial scale. It usually is fast and gives a good yield of biodiesel. Unfortunately, very specific amounts of the reagents must be mixed in a very specific way, or a side reaction called saponification will occur. \"Saponification\" roughly means \"soap-making\" in Latin, and a soap-like product (sodium fatty acid anion) is produced. This product will form an emulsion, a milky mixture of biodiesel, glycerol, water, and unreacted vegetable oil that is too difficult to separate to be useful. Lipase-catalyzed transesterification uses lipases, which are enzymes that break down fats and oils into glycerol and fatty acids. This process is safe, fast, and it eliminates the saponification risk, but it has not been optimized for industrial scale production of biodiesel. Isolating enough enzyme and keeping the enzyme functional long enough are factors that must be dealt with to make lipase catalyzed biodiesel production worthwhile.\n\nA team in India tried to deal with the first problem. They tried to indentify soil (i. e. very common) bacteria that can produce enough lipase to carry out the reaction. They began by isolating fifteen strains of bacteria from soil samples in areas where lipolytic bacteria would be likely to thrive, such as an oil mill and a dairy processing plant. The strains were grown on agar media that contained tween 80, an emulsifier composed of oleic acid (a fatty acid) bound to a small sugar. If the bacterial strain produced lipase, this would be broken down, causing the fatty acid to be freed. Three strains produced lipase and one of these was studied further. The lipase was isolated on beads and was used to produce methyl oleate, a major component of most biodiesel.\n\nA group from Spain recently tried to investigate ways to extend the life of lipase. Because these lipases must be exposed to methanol, the researchers hypothesized that methanol may denature the protein, inactivating it. For their experiments, the group used commercial lipases from the fungus Candida antarctica in both free enzyme and bead immobilized forms. They found that upon exposure to methanol, the bead immobilized enzyme became deactivated more quickly. This led them to conclude that methanol adsorbs to the beads, which causes faster deactivation.\n\nIn addition to the variety of catalysts available for biodiesel production, the source of the vegetable oil makes a difference in the utility and cost effectiveness of biodiesel. Frequently, \"neat\" vegetable oil (NVO) is used to make biodiesel. This is relatively easy because so much oil is already produced for food. Unfortunately, using this oil increases the price of food (a lot of our food is fried!), so it is not a cost effective method of fuel production. A much better source of vegetable oil is waste vegetable oil (WVO), oil that has been used for deep frying that has become too old to use.\n\nWVO is not as pure as NVO; it contains semi-combusted fats, free fatty acids, hunks of burnt French fries etc., but it is an environmental hazard in its own right, and restaurants have to pay to have it disposed of. Making WVO into biodiesel is useful and is very cheap (if not messy).\n\nWVO is cheaper than petrodiesel, but is it cleaner? How does engine efficiency compare? These questions were asked by a team of researchers from the New Mexico institute of Mining and Technology. Their methods were simple; they burned biodiesel, petrodiesel, and B-20 in two diesel generators and studied the efficiency and emissions. They found that WVO biodiesel is as efficient or more than petrodiesel, and produces the same amount or less of a variety of pollutants, including carbon monoxide, nitric oxide, and unburned hydrocarbons, which are poisonous, a source of acid rain, and carcinogenic respectively.\n\nSome biodiesel research in recent years has involved in oils derived from algae. Algae grow fast, don't take up much space, aren't used for food, and can produce large amounts of oil. Unfortunately, according to a team of researchers from the Bulgarian Institute of Plant Physiology and Genetics (not affiliated with the American Petroleum Institute) calculated the cost of everything required to grow enough algae to make biodiesel and found that it is about equal to the price of an equal amount of petrodiesel. This means large scale production of algal biodiesel has long way to go to become economically viable.\n\nOverall, WVO biodiesel is the most useful form. It is the cheapest, has the least effect on food prices and is as functional as petrodiesel. The issue is moot if you drive a car with a gasoline engine (as most Americans do), but if you drive a car with a diesel engine, use WVO biodiesel!", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "5e2a2a29-b519-45a6-a2d6-0bc78baefebb", "url": "https://blogs.biochem.ncsu.edu/biodiesel-magliocca/"}
{"text": "Pages\n\nSaturday, May 14, 2011\n\nLately, I've given you tips on ways to be creative and to write, and today we're going to examine how to build characters for your stories. For me, characters have never been a problem to create because I have all sorts of interesting characters who plague my mind all the time, as I have mentioned to you before. And the nice thing about them is, they show me who they are, so it's easy for me to write what I see, but this isn't always an easy thing to do for some writers.\n\nOne thing you must do to be a good writer is to observe all of your surroundings. What may appear to be insignificant to some, is a great deal of importance to me, as a writer. An easy exercise to follow is to sit outside and watch what is going on around you. Make sure you have a notepad or a laptop or electronic tablet with you, so you can write what you see. How are people interacting with each other? From observing their body language, what is it telling you? Are these individuals happy or sad, confused or worried, angry or upset? What type of clothing are they wearing? What do they look like? Are they tall or short? Thin or fat? What kind of features do their face have? What physical ailments do they have, if any? You get the general idea. Just write what you see, and worry about the notes later. Remember, these are your personal notes, so you don't have to make them neat and orderly--all of that will come later. You'd be amazed at what you can learn from just watching people and gain a better understanding of the human element.\n\nWhen you're alone at home, you should open a window and sit, with eyes closed, and listen to what you hear? Are there birds chirping? Do you hear cars driving up and down the street? Can you tell the difference in what type of vehicles you hear? SUV or car, possibly a motorcyle or bike? Is the engine noisy or is it smooth and quiet? Do you hear children? If so, are they yelling, laughing or screaming at one another? Can you tell how they are feeling from what you hear? Do you hear leaves scraping against the ground? Is it raining, and if so, what are the sounds you hear? After you've sat for about five or ten minutes, write down what you heard. Again, these notes will be used later.\n\nAfter you've completed the above exercises, you need to have some kind of idea of what it is you would like to write. If you're not sure, it's okay because this is why you took the notes. When I try to write something and not sure what I'm going to write, my notes are like a Bible to me. I use them to build the characters I plan to create, and the more you use your notes, the better you will become at creating interesting characters for your stories, and the nice perk about that is sometimes it will open your mind and a story will almost create itself without you having to put forth much effort. Before you know it, you have a general outline for the beginnings of a novel.\n\nWhat I just described to you is exactly how I wrote Silent Knight. I had no idea where that story was going or where it planned to take me. I wrote down what my characters showed me, and when I examined my notes, I was lost. I literally sat at my desk, with fingers brushing the keyboard of my laptop, and Silent Knight just fell out of my mind. I was shocked because I really didn't plan to write exactly what I wrote, but again, you get the idea.\n\nI can't tell you how many times when I'm out and about and see things happening between people, my husband will say to me, \"I know that will end up in one of your books one day.\" I usually smile and think to myself, he's absolutely right. Each night that I sat down to write the novel, I would laugh at what my characters were doing. Creativity for writers takes on different forms, and some of what I say to you may sound weird, but it's how I create. Another key element to creating characters is knowing them. I'm sure I may have mentioned this to you before. I know my characters so well that when I slip up and write dialogue that I meant to use for another character, right away I know it's not something that particular character would say. You need to be as intimate with your characters as possible so they come across as believable, and more importantly, your characters will entrust you with the story you are building.\n\nSome of you may be thinking, \"well Kim is talking like these characters are people she personally knows?\" The short answer to that is, some of my characters are based off of people I know, so yes, I do know some of them pretty well. However, on the other hand, just observing people and taking great notes, I get to know them--that is, if they didn't pop up on my silver screen in my mind. As I will state again, and I cannot reiterate enough, practice makes perfect. The more you do these exercises, the better you will be. My mind is like a sponge. I soak up as much information as I can and spill it out on the laptop, as soon as my sponge is full. When I go back over to review the last few chapters I've written, I'm always surprised at what I read. It's like someone else is writing the words, and I'm just a book lover looking in.\n\nThis is why I stress to you always, you must never, ever, ever give up writing, if it's truly something you love doing or are aspiring to become. Writing is not easy to master, even for those of us who have been kissed with the gift of words. Even your well-known authors have to stay on top of their A-game. You can never learn enough, when it comes to writing. Also remember, it's good practice to read lots of books and see how well-established authors write. I don't mean for you to copy their style, but find books you enjoy, and see how their work flows. That, too, will give you great insight on how to develop and find your own writing style.\n\nAs always, stay focused, practice, keep to your writing schedule, research material and do your homework, read, read, and read some more, and when your sponge is full, release it onto your computer and see where your story takes you. Writing is meant to be enjoyable, so most definitely have fun with your characters and storylines! Remember, Peace, Love and Write ON!

{"text": "Buy Article:\n\nAbstract:\n\nABSTRACT Waxed and nonwaxed mature green tomato fruits were stored at 12C (nonchilled) or 5C (chilled) for 5, 10, 15 and 20 days before being transferred to 22C for 3, 6, 9 and 12 days, were evaluated for weight loss, chemical composition, skin color, chilling injury (CI) index and pigment content. Waxed fruits showed a delay in weight loss, color development and ripening. The sensitivity of tomato fruit to CI was reduced in waxed fruits, which showed a delay in the appearance of symptoms. A delay in chlorophyll degradation and lycopene synthesis was observed as a result of the use of wax and low temperature. Waxing of tomato fruits allowed their storage at temperatures below critical reducing CI sensitivity and maintaining quality giving more time for marketing. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS Nowadays, local tomato producers use wax on fruits as an everyday practice to carry postharvest fungicides and to improve brightness. They store tomato fruits at nonchilling temperature (12C) because lower temperatures would cause chilling injury and irregular ripening. In this way, it is interesting that waxing tomato fruits allow reducing their storage temperature, protecting them from chilling injury and maintaining their quality and correct color change and ripening; thereby producers and sellers have more days to position their fruits with no extra cost.", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "59f3727b-301f-40d1-afbf-f3e7ab490b55", "url": "http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/bsc/jfq/2009/00000032/00000006/art00005"}

{"text": "Young soldiers from the Royal Lancers in Tonbridge\nduring the First World War, 1915.\nPhoto: Popperfoto\n\nWilfred Owen\nGuy Cuthbertson Yale University Press, 346pp, £25\n\nListening to the rhetoric of the Secretary of State for Education and his allies, you could be forgiven for thinking that the anti-heroic reading of the First World War began with Joan Littlewood, or even Richard Curtis. The truth is that the culprits are far more deeply entrenched in the cultural and educational world: the rot set in with the eyewitnesses whose records of the war made such an anti-heroic version almost canonical within a few years – the journalists and memoirists and, above all, the poets. Wilfred Owen has far more to answer for than Rowan Atkinson.\n\nThe prevailing reading of the 1914-18 conflict among most thoughtful people – across the class divides – was that it was a nightmare of ineptitude, squalor and waste. Geoffrey Studdert-Kennedy (\"Woodbine Willie\"), the army chaplain whose brave, sometimes nakedly sentimental poems shaped the response of huge numbers during and after the war, famously described the conflict as a \"Waste of Muscle, Waste of Brain, Waste of Patience, Waste of Pain … Waste of Glory, Waste of God.\" In another of his poems he describes his feeling after a week of conducting funerals: \"God! What sorrow and what rain!\" The stubborn affirmation of the dignity and, yes, heroism of individual soldiers is not allowed to obscure the absurdity and offence of the whole enterprise.\n\nBut it's hardly as though these were the first poets to observe the horrors of war. There is Shakespeare's startling prose meditation – tellingly, in the voice of a private soldier – in Henry V (\"the king himself hath a heavy reckoning to make when all those legs and arms and heads, chopped off in a battle, shall join together at the latter day and cry all, We died at such a place\"). Looking back from this, there is Homer; forward, Tolstoy. Why should anyone going into the trenches have had any illusions about war? Was it really such a shock?\n\nPart of the answer is perhaps that the First World War was the first major conflict in which mechanised weaponry made mass killing possible on a scale that must have rendered any individual acts of heroism virtually meaningless. The sheer industrial magnitude of the operation meant that giving significance to the routine atrocity and suffering all around was unprecedentedly hard. The shock was not the physical danger or degradation itself, but the mixture of a protracted stalemate and an uninterrupted production line of technologically crafted killing.\n\nHence, as Guy Cuthbertson rightly notes in this very readable and focused biography, Wilfred Owen's deepest protest is captured in one of the best-known poems, his sonnet \"Anthem for Doomed Youth\", which starts \"What passing-bells for those who die as cattle?\" It is not, says Cuthbertson, a protest against war as such but against a war that seems to silence proper mourning and to blur the distinctive human actions and human faces of the victims. It is a very uneven poem: the octave is full of sharp consonantal blows and images of violent chaos, and the sestet softens into a liquid gentleness – skilfully done, but at the cost of a slightly cloying romanticism (\"The pallor of girls' brows shall be their pall,/Their flowers the tenderness of patient minds\"). Yet the stark opening is justly thought of as one of the iconic statements of the war.\n\nOwen vacillates about the justifiability of armed conflict, although he becomes more convinced a pacifist as time goes on; but here he is not making a point about war so much as underscoring something about the new levels of depersonalisation in modern conflict. It is indeed a religiously haunted poem – though Cuthbertson wrongly thinks that passing-bells are a Roman Catholic convention rather than something any country parish in England would be familiar with – in its search for an appropriate ritual in which to reclaim lost dignities.\n\nThis wobbling of tone between starkness and sentimentality is one of the more challenging things about Owen's poetry. Cuthbertson quotes a fair amount of the pre-war material, much of which is frankly dismal: quite a lot of sub-Tennysonian maundering, medieval stage-setting and just a hint of flirtation with 1890s sensualism, though very much at second hand. Poetry – or rather \"Poesy\" – is presented as a kind of antidote to the risks of physical passion (\"God's soothest answer to all passion's plea\"), a way of conserving imaginative energy through continence.\n\nPassages such as this raise the difficult question of Owen's emotional and sexual life – a very complex matter that Cuthbertson deals with intelligently and unsensationally. On balance, he is inclined to think that Owen consummated no relationships, with men or women; he remained profoundly attached to a mother whom he addresses in quasi-religious terms, and his deepest attachments seem to have been with young teenagers of both sexes – uncomfortable for a modern reader, though not by any means unusual in the period.\n\nHis poems for Arthur Newbolt, a boy he befriended during his stay at the Craiglockhart hospital, are not simple rhapsodies to youthful male beauty: Arthur is (in a striking turn of thought) \"not yet young\", and \"youth\" is what will bring the shutting down of innocence, the arrival of irony (\"wry meanings in our words\"). Once again, there is a real unease about sexual self-awareness: poetry is there to conserve a pre-pubertal clarity and intensity of vision.\n\nCuthbertson offers little encouragement to those who want Owen's identity to be straightforwardly gay but he acknowledges that there is a good deal of vague homo­erotic subtext in much of his mature verse – and that Owen was taken up by the discreet, fastidious and rather solemn group around Oscar Wilde's loyal friend, Robbie Ross. He quotes some hair-raisingly silly and offensive observations by Robert Graves to the effect that Owen and Siegfried Sassoon were shocked by the deaths of soldiers because they were homosexual (that is, they felt the same shock and intensity about male victims of violence that others would feel about \"fields of corpses of women\"; this gets worse the longer you think about it), and that Owen's \"passive homosexual streak\" made him a \"weakling\".\n\nThis tells us a great deal more about Graves than about Owen or Sassoon but at least it reminds us, Cuthbertson notes, of the risks of tidy binary categories in the reading of the literature of this period (Graves himself recognised the imaginative and emotional confusions connected with the conventions of middle- and upper-class education and with the exclusively male environment of the army, and seems to have been troubled by ambivalent memories of his own schooldays, \"honourable and chaste\" as they were).\n\nIn his introduction Cuthbertson quotes Owen's characterisation of the poet as essentially \"childish\" – \"a Child of Nine\" – and the theme recurs, making the war poetry still more poignant: Peter Pan in the trenches, a boy (though Owen was in his mid-twenties when he died) determined not to grow up, yet confronted with unmanageable adult trauma and not turning away from it. No wonder that another of his iconic poems, \"The Parable of the Old Men and the Young\", depicts an Abraham who has no compunction in slaughtering his child, despite God's vain efforts to persuade him otherwise. Cuthbertson rather oddly thinks that this has more to do with Owen's conflicted feelings about his father than with the war, and gives the poem less weight than it deserves; but it is difficult not to see in this a protest about everything – the war above all (why else the reference to \"parapets and trenches\"?) – that spells the doom of childhood perception.\n\nOne of the things that makes Owen still compelling is surely this style of celebrating the child's eye – not in Trahernian or Wordsworthian directness but obliquely, by the furious lament for its violent destruction. It may seem strange to think of the hardened troops in the trenches as childlike, yet we need to remember not only Owen's air of \"innocence\" (the descriptions of his social skills in mixed company make him sound like a schoolboy) but the bare fact that so many of the casualties of the 1914-18 war were virtually children. Only now, after all, are we slowly waking up to the truth that sending adolescents into battle has a few moral questions around it.\n\nCuthbertson's judgements can be a bit uneven and some of his occasional identifications of literary or other echoes do not quite persuade. I cannot see that the wry \"I am the enemy you killed, my friend\" in \"Strange Meeting\" has anything to do with Wilde's \"Each man kills the thing he loves\", for instance. For Owen, what is happening is the ironic discovery only on the far side of death of a solidarity that has been there all along; not Wilde's insight at all. His touch is also rather unsure on the obscure question of Owen's religious sensibility: he tends in some passages to assimilate a rather autopilot medievalism to specifically Catholic promptings or interests (as with the passing-bells, and as with \"The city lights across the waterside\", which is mostly standard and rather lifeless antiquarian stage-setting).\n\nOwen had some passing interest in Catholic culture, not surprisingly, given his long sojourn in France, but his religious feeling was always difficult and independent. His evocation of the impact of war-shattered roadside crucifixes and ruined churches is powerful. But the most interesting thing Owen does with this is to suggest that the violence of the war has somehow stripped away the comfortable veneer of familiarity from the worn images of unspeakable suffering that litter churches. As for Studdert-Kennedy in his more unsophisticated verse, there is something about the trenches that makes for both the most extreme and angry protest about religious confidence (\"Near Calvary strolls many a priest\") and the most intense sense of a real but helpless divinity (like the God who fails to stop Abraham's sacrifice).\n\nThere seems to have been a conscious decision not to spend too much time comparing Owen with other war poets. Graves features a little, Sassoon a bit more, but Ivor Gurney rates only a couple of mentions, and David Jones – admittedly a rather special case – does not appear at all. It is an intelligible choice; but there might have been some allusion to the way in which the Jones of \"In Parenthesis\" tries, with brilliant effect, to \"rescue\" the archaic language of a heroic age for the unheroic casualties of the trenches and to clothe them with a mythology, religious and secular, appropriate to their human richness. And – though this may not be wholly fair – it is a bit surprising to find no use made of Pat Barker's wonderful recreation of Craiglockhart and its inmates, especially her absorbing account of the process of Owen revising \"Anthem for Doomed Youth\" under Sassoon's guidance.\n\nThis book does not aim to replace Jon Stallworthy's definitive biography, or to be a comprehensive critical survey; but it is a vigorous, well-documented narrative, with fresh light to cast on some central themes. It is excellent on the Shropshire background, on Owen's educational career, including his long-lived nostalgia for the Oxford he had never attended, and on the curious life he led as an émigré in France. It offers too some intelligent analysis of Owen's growing technical accomplishment as a poet (it is tempting to connect his skilful use of chiming consonantal groups and vocalic half-rhymes with some Welsh genetic imprint from the classical form of cynghanedd). Quite properly, it does not try to explain the process by which a rather immature flâneur, writing mostly imitative and slack verse, comes to be not only such an emotionally raw and unsparing writer but one, increasingly, of hard-nosed technical proficiency.\n\nExactly what hurts anyone \"into poetry\" is not easily charted. But it would be sad if, in the confused noise currently surrounding the commemoration of the 1914-18 conflict, we domesticated the hurt or persuaded ourselves that \"Dulce et decorum est pro patria mori\" was any more innocent a slogan than Owen thought it was.\n\nRowan Williams, the former Archbishop of Canterbury, has joined the New Statesman as a lead book reviewer.

{"text": "Step 4: Finish and Decorate.\n\nRamen noodle soup is a delicious staple for poor college students (and those feeling nostalgic), but have you looked at the nutrition facts lately? Ramen usually contains such delightful ingredients as MSG, oodles of salt, fat, empty carbs, and not a vitiman in sight.\n\nBut it's so delicious you say? (I have one word for you, Scurvy).\n\nSo here's how to make your ramen (relatively) healthy while simultaneously not bankrupting yourself.\n\nStep 1: Gather the Necessary Goods\n\nThis meal has the advantage of being fast, dirt cheap, vegetarian and reasonably nutritionally sound.\n\nYou will need:\n-One package of Ramen noodles (either standard or organic varieties will do).\nIf you are a vegetarian the \"Oriental\" flavor of ramen sometimes contains no animal ingredients, it depends on the brand (Oriental Ramen is not vegan but the Thai Kitchen brand in the picture usually is!).\n-About a rounded 1/2 cup of a variety of frozen vegetables.\nSome I have used in the past include: chopped spinach, green beans, peas, chopped carrots, corn, edamame. If you have fresh veggies on hand, those work even better.\n-Soy sauce and/or miso\n-an egg\n\nStep 2: Quick, Go Boil Some Water!\n\nI probably don't need to say this, but you never know: open your package and find the little seasoning package and pull it out *before* you dump the noodles in. Seems self evident, but fishing a melting seasoning packet out of boiling water is not fun. So look before you dump.\n\nHere's the unconventional part:\n\nOnce your noodles are a little over halfway cooked, (still al-dente) dump the cooking water out and drain the noodles. Put another 2 cups of water on the stove.\n\n(Hey you just discarded a lot of gross starch and a fair amount of fat!)\n\nStep 4: Finish and Decorate.\n\nPour your delicious ramen noodles into a bowl! Since you only used a bit of the flavoring packet, your noodles might need a little something. Add some miso paste, tamari sauce, chili sauce, sesame oil, green onions, or other healthy flavoring.\n\nNow eat them!\n\n<p>Thanks for this instructable. You have given me many new ideas in the &quot;Ramen World&quot;!</p><p>I always make ramen with veggies like peas and such, and add an egg. ANd I don't usually use the seasoning packet, or if I do I use about 1/3rd of it. Great used with spices ice cumin, turmeric and a little ginger and/or curry powder</p>\n\n<p>Ewwww cooking the noodles with the water messes it up. You boil the water, and then pour it over the noodles in a bowl cover let sit for a couple minutes and eat before the noodles go soft. cooking the noodles softens them to much, and that is not how Ramen is meant to be eaten. This kills the taste. Buy ramen with no MSG.</p>\n\n<p>Just testing this: add a bit of potato to the broth to absorb more salt. I'm still uncertain in how long to let it sit before eating - dont want it mushy.</p>\n\nBack in my college days, I would add some refried beans to the ramen, making sort of a bean soup with noodles. You had to eat it fast, if it cooled off and sat, it got kinda gnarly.<br><br>Another thing I still like to do, is to add some peanut butter and some cayenne pepper, and then try to stir the PB in as much as possible, then add some veggies. You get this sort of psuedo Thai thing going on.\n\n<p>Before finished reading this comment my mouth watered thinking of Pad thai! this is a must try!</p>\n\n<p>Yum. PB in noodles is da bomb.</p>\n\ngross.\n\n<p>This is such an easy dish thanks for including it! * When adding the veggies (frozen or not) place them in the hot water before the ramen so the ramen does not over cook before the veggies are done.</p>\n\nWhat I do to get a vitamen or two in my ramen-put the water the package calls for in your pot. I peel and chop one carrot, add it, and dump in some fozen peas. (I guess you could just add frozen veggies, instead). Sometimes a drained can of mushrooms, whatever&nbsp;I have. THEN, turn the burner on, and follow the package directions. The veggies will be perfectly cooked.<br /> Your version sounds tasty, true. But this is an easy and fast way to add a little something to your ramen to make it a smigeon healthier.\n\nI just usually just leave out the packet seasoning completely. to much salt. drain all water. top with tuna and light soy sauce. may not be healthy, but I like it.\n\n<p>Sounds good</p>\n\n<p>I was curious, so I did a little research, and learned that while the original ramen noodles where fried in palm oil, but supposedly, most western brands are air dried, not fried, (air drying seems to increase the shelf life actually) which means most of the fat content comes from the animal fat in the flavor (seasoning) packets. On that note, the 'Top Ramen' brand oriental and chili varieties are vegetarian friendly, and all of the 'Pot Noodle' flavors (a UK brand) are vegetarian. I looked around for solid info on the air drying, but could mostly only find people ranting about how bad ramen is for you.</p>\n\nWhy not leave out the ramen altogether and replace them with a regular noodle? If you're buying all the vegetables it's not much of an extra expense.Then you would have a healthy meal.\n\nYummy! It looks delish\n\nYou do realize the majority of the fat is in the noodles, probably even some MSG.\nEver handle the noodles before? they are greasy.\n\nThere is no MSG in the noodles that I have, but there is a ton of fat!\nThat's why you dump the water when you boil the noodles. When you boil them, a lot of the fat floats to the top of the soup and you can just pour it out before you add the seasoning and more water.\n\nWhats so bad about MSG? As long as you don't grow a 11th toe from having a bit, its fine. There's actually a lot of it in tomatoes.\n\nyes, there is MSG naturally in tomatoes, and indeed in the brain, but that is not precessed free glutamic acid- the MSG used in food, and the bad kind. Glutamate is the main neurotransmitter in the brain, and this particular ingredient is known as an \"excitotoxin,\" because it swamps the brain with neurotransmitter and causes massive neuron death in the basil nuclei. no, the blood- brain barrier doesnt protect you from this, especially not when blood sugar is low (which is when you are hungry). MSG has been known to cause not only retinal damage, but also brain lesions, and has been connected with parkinson's and alzheimer's.\nthat's what is bad about it.\n\n<sup> It's true, we always check packages of food to see if it has MSG, if it has MSG, my mom won't buy it. What's also crazy is you can buy it as a spice at the grocery store. As said, it messes up your brain, and we all want to keep that, don't we?</sup><br/>\n\nwhat happened to my text, it's tiny!?\n\n<p>It means you are becoming smaller and less visible... A good thing...</p>\n\nToo much can cause eye damage(At least in lab rats). Some people get sick from a slight amount.\nSo if you're not one of those that get sick, and don't get too much, there really is nothing wrong with it.\n\nI was exaggerating when I said \"As long as you don't grow a 11th toe from having a bit\", instead of \"getting sick\", but yeah. As long as you aren't eating a pound of it a week, its not bad.\n\n<p>This brings back memories of the old dorm days.... Double plus good...</p>\n\n<p>btw if you use another some left over sauce like curry sauce or rendang sauce, it will taste better. try it :)</p>\n\nYou mention here \"Since you only used a bit of the flavoring packet\" - but I can't find anywhere there tells you to use any of it...??\n\nThey say it right after adding the egg\n\nOops!\nYou're right, my bad, edited.\n-R\n\nYou seem very biased about Ramen on this part of the instructions. I know it's unhealthy, but the way you write these instructions kinda makes a person feel like they're not eating right and it seems intended to scold a person for eating something that they only have enough money to afford for a while (mostly college kids). The parentheses parts definitely seems biased. The directions are great, but they shouldn't be intended to make someone feel bad for eating something and trying to make it healthier.\n\nIf you're vegan you'll be leaving out the *egg* as well (tofu works nicely, though. I usually saute mine beforehand with a bit of garlic and onion). Also, the Top Ramen brand Oriental and Chili flavors appear to be vegan.<br/>\n\nI freeze my tofu and then cut them in 1cm slices and put them in the soup. Freezing changes the texture of the tofu and so it becomes really spongey and takes up the soup really well...works especially well with those strongly flavoured instant noodles...unhealthy but it tastes good!\n\nI have it from a good veggie friend of mine that she trusts only the Top Ramen brand (Nissin) Oriental as far as veggie goes (I'll take your word for it on vegan; I'm a meat eater, so I'm just passing along wisdom!).\n\n&nbsp;that's maruchan brand not top ramen. &nbsp; Maruchan oriental = beef extract, &nbsp;top ramen oriental = vegan. &nbsp;Believe me. &nbsp;I'm vegan and I've been hunting for top ramen brand for about a year because all the stores around me switched to all maruchan and the beef and chicken top ramen flavors for some reason. Luckily for me I was recently I was at a store out of town and they had it so I stocked up.<br />\n\nhooooooorrraaaaaay for meat!\n\nThis actually works with any noodles, not just ramen. I've been using plain dried noodles and did almost the same thing as this all along before finding this...though I tend to poach the egg rather than do egg ribbons...\n\nI sometimes turn the noodles and vegetables down to a simmer (just at the low setting) and add the egg whole. I put the lid on and check it every few minutes. poached egg ramen yummy. the egg yolk still comes out runny but as long as it's heated through it's fine\n\nIf you look closely, Oriental-Flavor Maruchan Ramen (pictured in the instructable) contains beef extract. I always remembered it being vegetarian, though. Perhaps they changed the recipe recently.\n\n<p>I&nbsp;used to get confused by that as well but I think that they have one that is Oriental Flavor and one that is called Oriental and one of those is vegan, the other is not. <br /> &nbsp;</p> <p>They also had come out with a &quot;healthier&quot; version of Ramen called Choice Ramen and the chicken and beef ones were vegan but then after a while they changed the recipe so that they were not vegan anymore.</p>\n\nI does, however, not actually contain any Orientals, so that's a plus.\n\nI am surprised, no one got this joke - funny\n\nI overheard a little girl ask in a supermarket, \"what's oriental flavor?\"\nThe preoccupied woman with her, didn't respond.\nI said, \"it's made from orientals; they dry them and grind them up for flavoring.\"\nShe then went back to the woman (her mom?) and asked, \"what are orientals?\"\nApparently the woman hadn't paid any more attention to my reply than to the little girl's original question. She said, \"Oriental is another word for Asian, like your friend Tiffany.\"\nI quickly left the area.\nTrue story.\n\nor any flavors...\nwithout the seasoning! thats where all the saltt is\n\nXD\n\nyes the Maruchan is very un-veggie.\nThe thai kitchen brand I show makes vegan rice ramen though!", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "94f366e1-4c06-4d83-a8f9-b4d2bf997e0c", "url": "http://www.instructables.com/id/Make-Ramen-relatively-Healthy!/"}

{"text": "The Downward-Facing Dog (aka Adho Mukha Svanasana) is a posture where the body forms an inverted V-shape that is said to stretch the whole body from shoulders to legs to spine and builds strength throughout the body, particularly the arms, legs and feet. Downward-Facing Dog promotes the relief of fatigue and rejuvenates the body, improving the immune system, digestion and blood flow to the sinuses, and calms the mind and lifts the spirits.\nDownward-Facing Dog: Adho Muka Savanasana\n1. Come onto the floor on your hands and knees. Set knees directly below your hips [your feet should be hip-distance apart] and your hands slightly forward of your shoulders [also hip-distance apart]. Spread your palms, index fingers parallel or slightly turned out [all five fingers of both your hands should be evenly spread wide apart], and turn your toes under.\n2. Exhale while you lift your knees away from the floor keeping the knees slightly bent and the heels lifted away from the floor. Lengthen your tailbone away from the back of your pelvis and press it slightly toward the pubis. Against the resistance, lift the sitting bones toward the ceiling [and back], from your inner ankles draw the inner legs up into the groins, [heels may be turned slightly outward so that the outer edge of your feet are parallel.]\n3. Then with an exhalation, push your top thighs back and stretch your heels onto or down toward the floor. Straighten your knees but be sure not to lock them. Firm the outer thighs and roll the upper thighs inward slightly. Narrow the front of the pelvis. [Adjust so that your sit bones are still stretching up and back.]\n4. Firm the outer arms and press the bases of the index fingers actively into the floor [make sure all five fingers on both your hands are still evenly spread wide]. From your actively pressing index fingers lift along your inner arms from the wrists to the tops of the shoulders [keep the arms straight but do not lock elbows]. Firm you shoulder blades against your back, then widen them and draw them toward the tailbone [keeping the shoulder blades pinned down]. Keep the head between the upper arms, making sure to not let your head hang.\n[5. Now while in Downward-Facing Dog adjust and align yourself, it is very easy to become misaligned while doing these steps, so take your time and align yourself correctly.

{"text": "Shock Cinema Magazine\n\nTuesday, June 27, 2017\n\nMaybe 30 years from now people will stumble upon this review and laugh. Not because they happen to love hacky, easy jabs at Tom Cruise but because it got everything wrong. \"Pfft! What a fuggshettity ghost-brain,\" some man will cuss in future-speak while wearing his 'I'm Thinking' t-shirt memorializing one of the most iconic Cruise lines from THE MUMMY. \"I guess people back then couldn't comprehend the beauty of an Alex Kurtzman film,\" the man will mutter as he places a porcelain maquette recreating that memorable scene of Cruise being forced against his will by Universal Executives into pretending to enjoy being in the same room with co-star Annabelle Wallis in his display case of Dark Universe memorabilia. Maybe this could be like a Coen Brothers movie and we won't 'get it' until five years from now. Maybe I'm wrong and Universal Studios' misguided attempt to beat Marvel Studios at their own game won't end prematurely and remembered only by people who write listicles about failed movie franchises. But there's just something doomed about that Dark Universe logo. The fact that it's incorporated into the Universal Studios logo with the kind of overblown pageantry that's reserved for something established, familiar and well-liked places it somewhere in the realm of off-putting and unearned. It's saying, \"Hey, here's that thing you love\" with the misplaced confidence of your Mom's dorky boyfriend who keeps buying you puzzles of Pink Floyd album covers because the only thing he remembers about you is that you 'like music'. Even if it preceded a good or simply solid movie, the prematurity of the Dark Universe logo would smack of unchecked hubris and understand, THE MUMMY is neither good nor simply solid. In fact it looks unusual playing inside an actual theatre and not within its natural habitat: following a marathon of FRANKLIN & BASH episodes in the wee hours of the morning on TNT. THE MUMMY isn't the cornerstone on which cinematic universes are based. It's the cornerstone on which an ironic GAME OF THRONES throne entirely constructed out of flea-market VHS tapes is based.\n\nDeceptively, THE MUMMY starts out well enough with an origin of its titular character Ahmanet (Sofia Boutella). The backstory about an Egyptian Princess whose thirst for power leads her into making a pact with Set -- the god of storms and squalls -- only to find herself buried alive in a sarcophagus filled with mercury, is basically de rigueur for modern Mummy movies. But what separates this from the pack is its visceral qualities. The throat of an infant is slashed early on and even though we don't actually see it, we do get a queasy sound effect of the newborn's death rattle. Additionally, Boutella's eerie, feral presence in these scenes is just fun to watch. In fact, every scene she's in is entertaining. Whether manipulating those her around her in order to escape from Dr. Jekyll (Russell Crowe)'s secret lab or straddling Cruise at knifepoint on top of a mausoleum tomb, Boutella is the one reason you may want to half-watch this as you perform household chores when it finally arrives on basic cable a few years from now. But Boutella's presence raises expectations in a way the filmmakers can't help but betray. Even though Boutella's Mummy is the most interesting character on screen, she is, for whatever reason, not the focus of THE MUMMY. That honor instead goes to Cruise.\n\nRumor has it that the original script for THE MUMMY gave equal screentime to Cruise and Boutella's characters. It also revolved around a far more interesting idea involving a team of Navy SEALS fighting mummies in Iraq. But when Cruise came on board, he commissioned his screenwriting cronies Dylan Kussman and Christopher Quarrie to beef up his part and add a subplot about his character becoming possessed by Set. Reportedly, Cruise also oversaw the editing and, more or less, co-directed the film with Kurtzman. If true, this explains why THE MUMMY is a failure but it doesn't explain why Cruise looks so disengaged from the material. It's not a performance as much as it is a begrudging favor and this is strange because it's nothing more than a vanity project thinly disguised as a franchise tentpole. Not only does Cruise receive God-like powers at one point, he's so funny and sexy that corpses spring to life just to make out with him. But apart from Cruise's clear yet befuddling indifference, he's terrible at playing any character that isn't a muted, less terrifying version of himself. Ethan Hunt is Cruise minus the perceived skeletons. You don't watch MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE and wonder if Hunt laughed when someone sort of like David Miscavige (but for legal purposes, isn't) told him an embarrassing anecdote about the time he accidentally farted in front of that woman he handcuffed to the hotel sink and eventually starved to death for being a \"suppressive person.\" You don't assume that when Jack Reacher is alone he screams into a pillow until thoughts of that swarthy key grip on the set of EDGE OF TOMORROW step outside of his poor ungay penis and leave it alone for the moment. Cruise's Nick Morton is not a typical heroic Cruise surrogate, he's a scumbag with a heart of gold. If the film were made a few decades earlier, the character would have been played by Bill Murray or Harrison Ford in full-on 'can-we-get-the-fucking-shot-already-I-have-diarrhea-and-I-just-want-to-sit-in-the-dark-in-my-fucking-hotel-room' angry grandpa mode. But considering that Tom Cruise can't play anything besides a grim-dark variation on Tony Robbins, he has no idea what to do with this character. Cruise's performance doesn't suggest someone who won a Burger King sweepstakes to play a role in an upcoming Dark Universe movie because it suggests someone who won a Burger King sweepstakes to play a role in an upcoming Dark Universe movie but, through some scheduling mishap, could only shoot their scenes minutes after surgery when the anesthesia still hasn't worn off. Disoriented and annoyed, Cruise's Nick Morton is an indifferent shrug of a character who has zero chemistry with everyone on screen. Particularly Wallis, with whom he's supposed to share a will they/won't they vibe with even though everything about their forced coupling screams \"please don't.\" He's dead-eyed and oily, she's a lifeless, immovable object and whenever they're together it's like watching a burnt-out Amway salesman make half-hearted love to a mid-century boat figurehead.\n\nTo be fair, Cruise isn't entirely to blame for THE MUMMY. Tonally awkward, the film can't make-up its mind about whether it wants to be a horror movie or a light and breezy, tongue-in-cheek action movie. Premature ejaculation jokes happen right in the middle of scenes where a zombified Jake Johnson starts stabbing everything in sight, including Courtney B. Vance in a thankless glorified cameo -- incidentally, while we're on the subject of Jake Johnson's pointless character: He gets possessed, murders a few people, dies and then his ghost strong-arms Cruise into being sacrificed by Ahmanet? Why exactly does Cruise utilize his newly acquired God-like abilities to bring this weasel-y asshole back to life at the film's end? Did test audiences respond to Johnson's comedy-like, quasi-quips that much? Additionally, it's anti-climactic. The final showdown between Cruise and Boutella ends with a fight that feels like the cinematic equivalent to getting dumped via text. Even worse, THE MUMMY is a convoluted mess simply because of all of the spur of the moment world-building it's forced to perform. Never mind that the Marvel movies didn't get mired in their Moebius strip, every-movie-feels-like-the-second-part-of-a trilogy-that-will-never-end story structure until THE AVENGERS, yet in THE MUMMY what little momentum this film has built up grinds to a halt the moment we take a detour into Dr. Jekyll's lab. Serving as this cinematic universe's Nick Fury, Crowe's Dr. Jekyll is a walking info dump whose only purpose is exposition. Not just for this shitty movie but for movies that haven't even happened yet. Specifically that nebulous Monstervengers film where Cruise, Johnny Depp, Javier Bardem and The Rock team up to fight -- I don't know -- The Phantom of the Opera, Fu Manchu and Sara Karloff? I guess? I miss the days when potential franchises weren't really expensive TV pilots.\n\nConsidering the pathological need studios have for extended cinematic universes, I suppose the idea of a Universal Horror-verse isn't a bad idea if we must have one, I guess. It's just a bad idea to follow the Marvel Studios model this closely. A horror concept doesn't work if it's forced to conform to the mechanics of a superhero movie. Even still, THE MUMMY wants to be a Marvel Studios movie in the worst way but the differences between these franchises are glaringly obvious, right down to the in-jokes and Easter eggs. But whereas the sight of Klaw or Howard the Duck will cause a theater to echo with the dull, nerdy thud of ribs getting elbowed, THE MUMMY's in-jokes err on the side of duh. Hey, there's the severed hand of the Creature from the Black Lagoon and Dracula's skull and that golden book thing from the Brendan Fraser Mummy. What's that? You didn't even notice it? Yeah, nobody did. Most likely because nobody really wanted to see this movie. I feel like the only people who sat through this were those who couldn't get into that sold out screening of WONDER WOMAN or families who got the times wrong for CARS 3 and didn't want to wait an hour. Seeing this is about as good as not seeing it because you won't remember a single moment from THE MUMMY.\n\nFriday, June 9, 2017 that\n\nTuesday, May 30, 2017\n\nMentioning you dislike PROMETHEUS is a lot like mentioning how much you hate the noodling, dimwitted pretention rock of Tool: the damned souls of one thousand Redditors will suddenly blink into existence and moan \"you just didn't get it\" as they shake their ghostly nerd shackles in your face. But the thing is, I did get PROMETHEUS. In fact, I don't think there's a single person on earth who didn't get PROMETHEUS. Who didn't understand that PROMETHEUS was about faith and the origins of creation? The point of PROMETHEUS was clear; everything else wasn't. Damon Lindelof's plot-hole riddled screenplay (which, to his credit, wasn't nearly as big of a mess as his screenplay for TOMORROWLAND) was filled with so many vague plot-points and unexamined character motivations that it played like a strangely solemn book of unfinished Mad Libs. It was beautifully photographed, meaningless but posturing and covered in a preponderance of black alien jizz. In other words, PROMETHEUS was a Matthew Barney movie for people who believe that crisis actors actually exist (not all PROMETHEUS fans are Truthers but, I guarantee, every Truther is a PROMETHEUS fan). Yet, as much as I hated PROMETHEUS, I'll still take it over ALIEN: COVENANT. Because as affected as PROMETHEUS was, it was still its own thing. ALIEN: COVENANT simultaneously feels like a weird apology for PROMETHEUS while also sort of functioning as an EVIL DEAD 2-style remake of PROMETHEUS. It commits a sin even its predecessor didn't commit: it's shrug inducing and forgettable.\n\nOn the plus side, COVENANT opens with a prologue that's probably a bit more bizarre than the one found in PROMETHEUS. Mainly because it gives us the daring return of Guy Pearce as old man Weyland, one of the more 'who-cares', tertiary characters found in PROMETHEUS. It should also be noted that Pearce's elderly make-up this time around has improved. It now looks like a rubber Nixon mask instead of resembling the end result of having someone hurl small pieces of wet toilet paper at Pearce's face from across the room. In this scene Weyland has just added the finishing touches to android David (Michael Fassbender) and literally after seconds into his creation's birth, Weyland is passive-aggressively picking apart the way David plays Wagner on the piano. If COVENANT was just a fake old man belittling an android as if it was some kind of mannered, Merchant Ivory sci-fi spin on SHUT UP LITTLE MAN, I would have loved it, but almost immediately the pair discuss creation and creators and gods and monsters and 'hey, man! What if Ferris Bueller was just a delusional manifestation of Cameron's desire to be the coolest guy in Chicago?\" As in PROMETHEUS, every time the film tries to get philosophical it just feels like getting stuck in a room with a really stoned friend of a friend who has a theory that \"every time an angel is mentioned in the bible, it's actually just a cyborg because the bible didn't have a word for cyborg yet.\" It's the kind of freshman dorm 'deep thoughts' that made PROMETHEUS so goddamn insufferable.\n\nFrom there, COVENANT flashes forward about 30 or 40 years. We're now aboard the colonization ship the Covenant. In a development that unfortunately mirrors last year's PASSENGERS, the Covenant receives a slight bit of damage causing the main crew to awaken from cryo-sleep several years before their arrival on some earth-like planet where everybody is totally pumped to build log cabins for some reason. As it turns out, the Covenant's crew is comprised of bland or sorely miscast character actors. There's Billy Crudup as an insecure second-in-command who, through awkward expository dialogue, alerts us to the fact that he is a man of faith who takes the funerals for his fellow crew members as a personal insult. Katherine Waterston plays her Ellen Ripley surrogate as if she was channeling Jane Adams, in that she's just frayed nerves and dewy eyes. It makes you wonder if she is going to fight the aliens or is Jon Lovitz going to call her \"shit\" after he rips a gaudy Franklin Mint ashtray out of her hands? Danny McBride is here and he's doing a toned down variation on his foul-mouthed Apatow-ian redneck character (at one point he calls a character sweet tits). Seeing him in this is about as distracting as it would be to see Buddy Hackett play a wise-cracking purser in the original ALIEN. Yet it's still not nearly as distracting as the fact that James Franco briefly appears as the ill-fated captain of the Covenant and Waterston's husband. Like McBride, it's not clear why he's in it. Especially considering that he's doing that weird thing where he seems to be appearing in this because he thinks it's ironic or funny or whatever. Fassbender is on hand as well as another android called Walter who speaks with an American accent so atrocious you think it's going to be part of a big reveal; sort of how Ben Kingsley's bad American accent was part of the twist in IRON MAN 3. But no, it's just bad.\n\nAs Walter and the main crew attempt to repair the Covenant, they stumble upon a distress signal from a nearby planet. Since nobody wants to return to their cryo-chambers because -- well, the film doesn't really explain why they don't want to return to their cryo-chambers. Which is weird because it doesn't look that bad. There's no catheters you have to get hooked up to or anything. I guess everybody just wanted to stay up, drink Dr. Pepper and play Super Mario Party for the next 45 or so years. Nonetheless, Crudup proposes instead to colonize this nearby planet. Of course, this is the same planet from PROMETHEUS where David was infecting his fellow crew-members with an alien virus. And, hey, wouldn't you know it? It turns out that David has been living here in what appears to be a genuine, motherfucking Dracula castle, growing out his robot hair (Why would Weyland program this option into David? In addition to repairs and average ordinary upkeep, why would you want the extra hassle of a giant goddamned Dolly Surprise who requires a fresh Richard Spencer haircut every two weeks?) and waiting for more humans to infect. Why? Again, I don't know. You're going to have to visit Ridley Scott at his H.R. Giger designed spinal-phallus stronghold and ask. Because even though he'll happily explain to you why in interviews, he's unwilling to put that same information in his movies.\n\nThe smartest thing Ridley Scott ever did with the Alien franchise was in handing over the directorial reigns to people like James Cameron, David Fincher and, yes, even Jean-Pierre Jeunet. Because even if most of those particular films were flawed, they still had their own distinctive identities and managed to take the franchise in slightly different directions. They weren't simply one man going, \"Ugh. What? Oh, Xenomorphs, right? That's the thing you like, right? Whatever. I need my tumbler of black alien jizz. Needy pricks.\" Apart from some moments of Cronebergian body horror that take the facehugger concept and make it far more terrifying, ALIEN: COVENANT feels like it was made by someone who made too many compromises and doesn't care anymore. Someone who's blindly going through the motions just to get it done. It's less a creative act and more of a contractual obligation. ALIEN: COVENANT is lifeless and rote. Even worse, COVENANT manages to retain everything bad about PROMETHEUS. Character development is clunky, subplots are introduced and suddenly dropped and it's still very, very stupid. Do the space helmets in the Ridleyverse constantly smell like a combination of hot dog burps and that farty smell Campbell's soup makes when you open the can? Is this why characters are constantly compelled to take them off on weird alien landscapes? If an effete android with implacably sinister intentions asks you to follow him to his castle basement and tells you to stick your head in a vaginal Venus flytrap thing, would you do it if he asked nicely and just had a temper tantrum because you killed his pink alien buddy that slaughtered your fellow crewmates? What was up with that slapsticky sequence where two different people slipped on blood? Wouldn't it have made more sense in the Friedberg & Seltzer parody movie version of COVENANT? If that wasn't enough, it also retains all of PROMETHEUS' pretention. A low point occurs when Walter and David argue over who wrote Ozymandias and it's like watching a knock-down-drag-out-fight between the guy who has a bumper sticker that reads, \"My Other Car is a Pynchon Novel\" and the dude who goes to the bar alone to pretend to read Infinite Jest. It's \"smart\" in that empty, showboating way that blowhards in their early twenties consider to be smart. ALIEN: COVENANT could be summed up by the scene in which two Michael Fassbender's make out: It looks really good but it doesn't go where you want it to go and, most importantly, there's a lot of build up for such a small disappointing payoff. In short, if you're bold enough to include hot, steamy Fassbender on Fassbender action, you better follow through to its bitterly erotic end.\n\nThursday, April 20, 2017\n\nWho wrote THE FAST AND THE FURIOUS series? Whoever it is,\nplease don't tell me. Never reveal to me the identity of the writer or writers\nbehind this franchise. In my mind the true author of these screenplays is a\ndimwitted man-child in an engineer's cap who recently realized that cars aren't\nthose things with the sails that float. I want to believe that before his\nscreenplay was given a slightly different rewrite, it was just 200 pages of the\nwords 'family', 'vroom', 'that's what I'm talkin' about' and pictures the\nscreenwriter traced out of the most recent issue of CARtoons. I don't want to think that an adult in their right mind\nwho doesn't constantly wear an engineer's cap sat down in some place that\nwasn't the top bunkbed in a halfway house and decided that a computer is\nsomehow powerful enough to hack a reflection in a car window. Because this is\nthe adult equivalent to a picture of 'army guys doing war and stuff' that a\nten-year-old doodled in their notebook during math class.\n\nBut whether the FAST AND THE FURIOUS franchise is written by\na 48-year-old man named Jimmy who grabs gas station hot dogs off the rollers,\nshoves them in his mouth and wanders off without paying or a slumming Kenneth\nLonergan under a pseudonym who is secretly making fun of the people that\nignored MANCHESTER BY THE SEA (I was one of those people. Also, if true, fuck\nyou Kenneth Lonergan), the series is still dumb. Granted, I'm not exactly\nbreaking new ground by saying that, but the films are dumb in a way that never\nstops being entertaining. Somehow THE FAST AND THE FURIOUS sequels always\nmanage to be dumb without teetering into the two hour, ice cream headache\ninducing abyss of stupidity that is any given Michael Bay movie. And though\nslightly aware, they never sink to the insufferable level of\nI'm-not-nearly-as-clever-as-I-think-I'm-being' self-parody of the SHARKNADO\nseries. It's a very difficult balancing act and at any moment the series could\neasily stumble and fall into either extreme but with THE FATE OF THE FURIOUS,\nthe series still manages to prove that a dumb movie is sometimes better than a\nlegitimately good movie. At least in terms of entertainment value.\n\nTHE FATE OF THE FURIOUS opens in Cuba. Why it opens in Cuba,\nI'm not sure. I'm also not sure why the series insists on making Michelle\nRodriguez and Vin Diesel a couple. Watching these two kiss or share pillowtalk\nis like watching an Arby's Meat Mountain sandwich wrapped in a black tank top\nget dropped on top of a concrete slab that someone sharpied a frowny face upon.\nI think this why the characters are rarely seen together throughout the film's\ntwo-hour-plus running time. At any rate, they're in Cuba and they're using\ntheir very shaky grasp of car-mechanics to settle a score with a smug repo man.\nBasically, the pair challenge him to a street race in a CHITTY, CHITTY BANG,\nBANG whimsy-jalopy that's rigged with a soft can pull tab that makes the car\ndrive backwards really fast. They manage to somehow win the race but being that\nDiesel's character is nothing short of a Christ-y, Oprah-like figure, he gives\nthe repo man a car just for trying. In fact, he basically gives everyone a car\nwithin earshot because even though Diesel looks like the Thing from the\nFantastic Four after somebody buffed his cracks out with Bondo, he's a good\ndude. From there, THE FATE OF THE FURIOUS awkwardly reminds you once again that\nthis series stopped being about illegal street racing several sequels ago and\nis now -- quite inexplicably -- about illegal street racers who secretly drive\nreally fast for the government to stop bad guys. Charlize Theron, looking like\nshe just shot a sketch about freegans for PORTLANDIA, blackmails Diesel into\nhelping her commit crimes for reasons I could never fully grasp. Something about\na nuclear powered submarine that can destroy all of the Wi-Fi? I don't know.\nNonetheless, we don't immediately find out what she has on Diesel. She just\nshows him something on her phone. Personally, I was hoping it was that picture\nof Diesel looking dopey and bloated without his shirt on that took the internet\nby storm a few years back.\n\nAt this point, I lost whatever narrative thread was driving\nTHE FATE OF THE FURIOUS. But that's ok, because plot is disposable and only\npresented in the five minute increments that exist between the film's various\nautomotive pop-shots. Which is just as it should be because if this film was\nnothing but automotive pop-shots, you'd never be able to go to the bathroom and\nthe world of THE FATE OF THE FURIOUS needs to be entered on a bladder that is\nas empty and voided as humanly possible. This is a world where oily pork mounds\nlike The Rock and Jason Statham wear provocative muscle shirts, kick each other\nin the chest and inanely tough talk each other in locations that simultaneously\nfunction as highway underpasses and abandoned factories. This is a world where\none woman -- apparently cosplaying as 4 Non Blondes' Linda Perry -- can hack\ninto and somehow control every car in Manhattan. This is world where -- Holy\nFuck! Is that fucking Helen Mirren?!? What the fuck!?! Helen \"Fucking\" Mirren\nis in this fucking film! In short, it's a flashy, shallow world but in a way it\nneeds to be because it doesn't understand what character development or even\ndialogue is. Theron's character isn't a character as much as she's the stiff\nsemi-human equivalent to that scene from THE DARK KNIGHT where the Joker wires\nthe two ferries to explode. The word family is said so much THE FATE OF THE\nFURIOUS eventually becomes a feature length Olive Garden commercial with\nshrinkage jokes. By the time Jason Statham is running around on a plane\nmurdering Theron's henchman as he carries around Diesel's character's son (we\nknow it's his son because the kid looks like he's trying to figure out who\nfarted in an elevator after he was hit in the face with a frying pan) it's such\na relief because nobody really needs to say anything. Least of all Diesel, who\nat this point in his career sounds like an unfair SNL sketch character version\nof Vin Diesel.\n\nIf it sounds like I'm being way too hard on THE FATE OF THE\nFURIOUS, I kind of am. Not just because it's a very stupid movie that just\nwants to give the world a scene where The Rock leans out of an SUV and casually\nguides a missile away from scratching his vehicle but also because I genuinely\nloved this movie. It's THE AVENGERS if it wasn't so up its own ass about its\nconvoluted mythos. It's what happens when 11 TANGO AND CASH's makes love to 12 DEMOLITION\nMAN's. It's the sweatiest, gayest porno movie ever made after it was re-contextualized\ninto something a J.G. Ballard character would masturbate to on YouTube. Much\nlike my love for The Grand Mac at McDonald's, I realize that championing this\nmovie makes me part of the problem but on the other hand, my love for The Grand\nMac means I won't be around much longer. So relax and enjoy TONI ERDMANN or\nwhatever.\n\nThursday, February 2, 2017\n\nThe\nworst part about the success of SOUTH PARK isn't that it was the show that\nlaunched a million bad Eric Cartman impressions. Nor is it that, for a few\nyears, it emboldened Trey Parker and Matt Stone to use their series as a cudgel\nto beat their contrarian, lib-bro-tarian values into the skulls of their fan\nbase, it's that the show's perceived simplicity made hacky individuals think to\nthemselves, \"Pfft. I could do that\". If SOUTH PARK never existed, Seth\nMacFarlane would have remained an obscure storyboard artist known only by the\nhardest of hardcore animation nerds. Even better, the Danish radio serial\nTERKEL IN TROUBLE would have never been adapted into a poorly animated but\nstill popular movie. In some ways this would have been a slightly less awful\nworld.\n\nWritten by stand-up comedian Anders Matthesen (who supplies most of the\ncharacters' similar sounding voices in the original Danish version), TERKEL IN\nTROUBLE is basically how most critics perceived SOUTH PARK to be in the\nlate-'90s, in that the film really is just pre-teens swearing, farting and\nkilling each other. Bullied at school, ignored at home and currently receiving\ndeath threats for accidentally sitting on a spider, Terkel is a mopey,\nadenoidal lump who, like every other character in the film, looks like a\nflayed, plasticine mole and never stops being the personal doormat to the\nworld. Along with his best friend Jason (who carries around a lead pipe simply\nfor the purposes of foreshadowing), Terkel drives a classmate to commit\nsuicide, numbly watches as his little sister blinds herself with forks and\nslips in a big puddle of piss because piss is the ultimate utmost in red-raw\nedginess, dude (as is Hitler cameos! And child-molestation sight gags! Somebody\nstop this envelope before it gets pushed too far!) There's nothing inherently\nwrong with filling your comedy with unlikable characters but shouldn't those\nunlikable characters be funny in some way? Because apart from the clever\nopening that satirizes those wannabe SE7EN-style credits sequences that were so\nubiquitous in the early aughts and a song (yes, this is a musical. Thanks\nagain, SOUTH PARK), from a criminally negligent children's help line operator,\nthere's nothing particularly funny about TERKEL IN TROUBLE. The film lacks a\nmotivating factor and specializes in the kind of bland nihilism preferred by\n14-year-olds who think they're blowing your mind that their Facebook profile\npicture is of themselves flipping off the camera. Very much a product of its\ntime, TERKEL IN TROUBLE boasts a pair of rap rock numbers, gratuitous\nreferences to THE MATRIX and the kind of jittery, unappealing computer\nanimation that wouldn't make the grade as a video game cut-scene nowadays. In\nshort, TERKEL IN TROUBLE isn't the kind of movie you watch, it's the kind of\nmovie you grow out of.\n\nTuesday, July 5, 2016\n\nFrom the moment it was released, INDEPENDENCE DAY was\nalready a yellowing Taco Bell Collector's cup of a movie, awaiting the day when\npeople at a flea market would absently pick it up, snicker and then put it back\nwhere they found it. A film so disposable and so of its time, it should have\nbypassed theaters completely and simply released in pog form. Like AVATAR, INDEPENDENCE\nDAY was an enormous success that somehow managed to leave almost no impact on\nthe pop-cultural landscape. Apart from that exploding White House scene used in\nthe trailer (but not the movie, for some reason) and Will Smith's hotly\ncontested pronunciation of earth, does anyone have memories of any other scenes\nor moments? Not even fond memories, just memories? As much as I dislike STAR\nWARS and the attendant fuzzie wuzzies brought on by the release of THE FORCE\nAWAKENS, I understand why people would be getting their nostalgic panties in a\nmisty-eyed bunch. Getting nostalgic over INDEPENDENCE DAY: RESURGENCE is like\ngetting wistful over a discarded Big Mac wrapper.\n\nTaking place twenty years after the events of the first\nmovie, RESURGENCE exists within a film world in which the characters reverse\nengineered alien technology for the benefit of humanity, although apart from\npropeller-less helicopters, moon bases with the structural integrity of a Jenga\ntower and the existence of slightly more monorails, it doesn't look that much\ndifferent from our world. Also, why? If the aliens' technology was so advanced,\nwhy the hell did they use our primitive satellites to communicate with each\nother in the first movie? At any rate, like a lot of elements in this movie,\nthe advanced technology doesn't amount to much because the aliens are very big.\nSo big, that characters are compelled to remind us about this at least twice.\nBut instead of throwing down their puny weapons in the face of such towering\nbigness, the world (but mostly just America) stands tall by pissing on the\nfloor of this stupid alien threat's spaceship and gives it a good ol' fashioned\nAmerican middle finger! Yee-Haw! Listen up you Extra Terristicles, when\nall-star-Mr.-USA-American Liam Hemsworth (who is actually Australian and\nboring) finally puts his penis away, he's going to jump into one of your\nspaceships (which he inexplicably knows how to operate) and piss on your\nsquishy heads with your own space-bullets! HA, HA! That's what you get for\nmessing with \"erf\" (but mostly just America)! However, pissing space-bullets\nand murder isn't enough. Once we kill off the alien queen, an elderly lesbian\nnamed Cheyenne who works at a vegan coffee shop (Brent Spiner. Didn't he play a\nscientist who died in the first film?) brusquely shoos us out of the theater\nwith a promise/warning that they're going to piss earth-bullets on the aliens'\nhome planet in the next movie!\n\nIf that sounds clichéd and a bit on the thin side,\nunderstand that RESURGENCE isn't just two hours of people trying to kill\naliens, failing, trying again and then urinating on the floors of whom or\nwhatever is frustrating them. It also has too many characters. Of course, that\nsurfeit of characters is there mostly just to accommodate the giant Will Smith\nshaped hole that sits in the center of this movie. One of those square pegs RESURGENCE\nrepeatedly tries to cram into the Smith-hole, is Hemsworth, and, for Christ's\nsake, could we please leave all of the Hemsworthing to brother Chris from now\non? Liam is like a Ken doll that somehow memorized a year's worth of Garfield\npunchlines. I don't want to watch him in a movie even if he's pissing on the\nfloor of a spaceship. But still, he's here playing a test pilot or a moon miner\nor something and he's also interacting with Jessie T. Usher and IT FOLLOWS'\nMaika Monroe as other test pilot-y, moon miner-ish characters who shoot things\nand say generic things like \"Did you miss me?\" and \"We've got company!\" But who\ncares about them? All of your favorite characters that weren't Will Smith or\nRandy Quaid are back! Such as Vivica A. Fox who the film can't kill off quickly\nenough. There's also a logy Jeff Goldblum who appears to be losing a personal\nbattle against the bottle of Nyquil he chugged shortly before director Roland\nEmmerich shouted \"action\", Bill Pullman playing President Whitmore in such an\ninexplicably enfeebled way it's like the screenwriters were challenged by\nEmmerich to turn the phrase, \"get off of my lawn\" into a character and Judd\nHirsch whose role isn't just unnecessary but so stereotypically, offensively\nJewish. Imagine if Garry Marshall was called in to punch up THE ETERNAL JEW\nwith a kvetching grandpa who just wants a nosh and you'll understand just how\nawful Hirsch's character is here. About the only element that works in RESURGENCE\nis Deobia Oparei as an African warlord who, for ten years, had to hunt down and\nkill the aliens from the first film after they crashed landed in his small village.\nWhy the fuck couldn't RESURGENCE have been about this instead?\n\nIf there's a plus side to INDEPENDENCE DAY: RESURGENCE,\nit's the fact that after 19 movies, the world is finally realizing that Roland\nEmmerich is Steven Spielberg with severe head trauma. Neither fun nor fun-bad, RESURGENCE\nis a slog and somehow manages to be dumber and emptier than its predecessor.

This country's non-white population have always been there, even when he had to more or less sneak them in by the side door.\n\nThese people — Black people, Native Americans and others — are not missing.

{"text": "Harlow was built in response to population overspill\nin post-war London and forms part of a ring of eight new towns\naround London. Harlow was built as a self-sustaining community\nnot as a satellite of London. It was built to enable local people\nto have access to open, green spaces, homes with jobs, neighbourhoods\nwith access to schools, pubs, community centres, shops and public\ntransport.\n\n2. Which of these objectives do you\nthink have been met?\n\nThe neighbourhood principles still remain strong\nin Harlow and access to green open spaces is still highly valued.\nThe concept of a self-sustaining community in which all people\nlive and work in Harlow has changed as skill requirements have\nnot been met by local residents and had to be imported from elsewhere.\nThere are considerably high levels of in and out commuting in\nthe town. A totally self-sustaining community is no longer a practical\nreality but one in which local residents have access to good quality\nlocal jobs is still an important part of the regeneration strategy\nin Harlow.\n\n3. What do you consider to be its role\nin the region/sub-region in the future?\n\nHarlow has the potential to become a significant\nplayer in the region and sub-region. Recent consultation on the\nlong-term future of Harlow has shown that local people and stakeholders\nin the town are interested in Harlow becoming a significant player\nin the region and to take advantage of the developments that are\nlikely to take place on the M11 corridor. Research indicates that\nthere is the potential for the town to double in size and that\nthis process would lead to considerable benefits to the town and\nregion. Through sustainable growth beyond its existing boundaries,\nHarlow could address some of the issues it currently faces in\nterms of poor image, under-investment and ageing infrastructure.\nNew businesses would be attracted to Harlow because of its position\non the M11 corridor and new investment in the town could lead\nto a significantly improved town centre and leisure and cultural\nfacilities.\n\n4. To what extent is the original master\nplan for the town still used as a guiding principle for development\nand redevelopment?\n\nThe Gibberd masterplan for Harlow is still valued\nand respected in plans for existing and future developments of\nthe town. The draft community strategy for Harlow clearly states\nthat the Gibberd principles will be adhered to in any new developments\nin the town.\n\n5. How well have the old and new parts\nof your town been integrated? If they have not been well integrated,\nwhat form does this take in physical/spatial terms and what are\nthe implications for future growth of the town?\n\nOld Harlow is one of the oldest areas of the\ntown. It has managed to retain some of its old town charm as well\nas becoming part of the neighbourhood concept for the town. Newer\ndevelopments such as Church Langley have been built around the\nneighbourhood concept and there is a rapid bus transit system\nin operation giving residents speedy access to the town centre\nand train station. It has to be said however that residents in\nChurch Langly do not necessarily see themselves as part of Harlow\nand this is linked to the \"poor image\" of Harlow in\nthe main. The image of Harlow is a key area being addressed through\nthe Harlow 2020 partnership and at the beginning of this year\na CD Rom was launched containing a series of positive images of\nHarlow as part of this programme of work.\n\n6. Has/can the town achieve the population\nthat was originally planned?\n\nHarlow has already achieved the population of\n80,000 for which it was originally planned.\n\n7. How does the age profile of your\npopulation relate to the national average? Is this related to\nyour being a new town? How do local agencies and strategies respond\nto that?\n\nHarlow has a population of 80,600. 21 per cent\nof the population are young people 0-14 years; 13 per cent 15-24\nyears; 64 per cent aged 16-64 and 16 per cent aged 65 plus. As\nan ageing new town the population is now beginning to reflect\nnational averages and the older population—75 plus is predicted\nto rise by 30 per cent of the next 10 years. There are some indications\nthat older people have remained in Harlow rather than moving away\nas in some areas of the country and this will place a number of\npressures on the provisions of services for older people.\n\n8. How strong is the demand for existing\ncommercial land? Is there demand for further commercial development\nin the town? What is the effect of commercial development in the\ntown on the towns in the sub-regional economy?\n\nIn the past 10 years there have not been significant\ndemands for existing commercial land in Harlow. There is a large\nbusiness park on the outskirts of the town which has taken a long\ntime to fill. There are large commercial developments close to\nthe town station which have failed to attract new companies. Growth\nhas come about through indigenous growth of existing companies\nrather than new companies moving into the area. Harlow has two\nmajor companies—Nortel Technologies and GlaxoSmithKline\nwhich have both made considerable investments in the town in the\npast few years. However, this is beginning to change and it is\nnoticeable that new interest is being generated in the town. If\nthe M11 corridor becomes a corridor for growth as is anticipated\nin the Government study currently underway it is likely that Harlow\nwill have a key role to play in this development. The Business\nPark is now almost at capacity and if the town grows outside of\nits boundaries this is likely to result in a significant increase\nin commercial development. This will undoubtedly have a significant\nimpact on towns in the sub-regional economy. We would hope that\nthis impact will be viewed in a positive light and complement\ncommercial developments in the neighbouring areas.\n\n9. Can you describe the sub-regional\nplanning arrangements that are in place to regulate/facilitate\ndevelopment? Can you describe the strengths and weaknesses of\nthe current approach?\n\nHarlow has been identified in RPG9 as a Priority\nArea for Economic Regeneration and we anticipate that this will\nbe reflected in the planning guidance for the East of England.\nHowever, it is not yet clear how this status will impact on Harlow.\nThis will become clearer in the light of the study on the M11\ncorridor. We believe that it is essential to work closely with\nregional and central Government on the implications of Harlow\nas a PAER particularly in terms of access to funding. The Government's\nGreen paper on Planning makes recommendations which could facilitate\nthe development and growth and strategic position of Harlow over\na long period in a regional context.\n\n10. What is the regional/sub-regional\nrole of the shopping centre in your town? What investment is proposed\nin the town centre in the next few years?\n\nIn the 70s and 80s Harlow town centre had a\nkey role to play as a sub-regional shopping location. The advent\nof out of town shopping and developments such as Lakeside and\nretail parks resulted in a decline in the town centre in a regional\ncontext. The Council and its partners have been working hard to\naddress town centre issues over the past 10 years and this has\nresulted in more housing and leisure activity being brought into\nthe town centre as well as upgrading of the existing indoor shopping\ncentre and most recently the development of the southern area\nof the town centre bringing more retail and leisure facilities\ninto the town centre. Town Centre South is a £60 million,\n16-acre development which will extend the size of the existing\ntown centre by one third. It will bring new retailers into the\ntown centre such as ASDA and Matalan. In addition, Debenhams are\nplanning to move into the town centre and further development\nis being planned for the north and central parts of the town centre\nwhich could be worth £10 million. There is still a great\ndeal to be done but the tide is turning on town centre development\nin Harlow. If, as initial consultation seems to suggest on the\ncommunity strategy, there is an agreement on the expansion of\nthe town—a doubling of the town's population over the next\n20 years is being looked at—this will present considerable\nopportunities for the continuing expansion and development of\nthe town centre.\n\n11. Can you give some numerical examples\nof the problems that have arisen with claw back and covenants\nin housing amenity space and other land uses?\n\nAt present only those properties included in\nthe Community Related Asset Transfer are subject to claw back.\nThe level of claw back at the time of the agreement in 1987 was\n100 per cent reducing by 2 per cent per year. Currently the Council\nwould have to pay 70 per cent of any uplift in value if a site\nwere to be sold for a use different to that specified in the agreement.\n\nNon specific problems are that all sites subject\nto claw back are restricted to their designated use until claw\nback level reaches a reasonable percentage to make any change\nfinancially viable.\n\nIn some instances it has been desirable to include\na portion of claw back land within an adjacent development. However,\nthis has not always happened because of the delay brought about\nby having to negotiate and agree a valuation with EP and the financial\nburden.\n\nAn example of this is at the Pinnacles where\na factory has encroached onto claw back land and although the\nCouncil is willing to dispose of the encroached area we await\nEPs response to agree our valuation figure.\n\nExamples where schemes have been put at risk\nbecause of delays caused by EP not responding or enforcing claw\nback are:\n\n— The balancing pond scheme at the\nPinnacles industrial area where we are still waiting agreement\non claw back to develop a fishing complex.\n\n— £4.8 million to English Partnerships\non the Town Centre South development—given the desperate\nneed for regeneration of the town centre—a strong case could\nhave been made to retain the money within Harlow to renew and\nrevitalise the town centre. In addition considerable delays were\ncaused in the negotiating with EP on the above.\n\n— Sydenham House Health Centre has\nbeen investigating the possibility of upgrading its health centre.\nThe Council has been working with the Health Centres Trust to\nimprove the facility but it has been placed in jeopardy because\nof the bureaucracy and delays likely to be caused through disposal\nof the site. We are looking claw back of around £14,000.\n\n— The Council has been negotiating\nthe surrender of a scout site lease which could be developed for\npossible social housing. The covenant restricting the lands will\nneed to be varied to enable it to be developed and again EP will\nreceive the benefit of this covenant under current arrangements.\n\n— A number of playbarns are now being\nlet out for alternative uses to community groups such as the Chinese\nCommunity Association at Lower Meadow where we still await a response\nfrom EP to allow the alternative use of this covenant. Although\nthis initially delayed the project we have agreed the lease but\nawait EPs response to allow the use albeit we feel EP may have\nacquiesced by not responding.\n\nAs the needs of the town change it is likely\nthat the Council will continue to look for alternative uses for\nsites which are subject to claw back or covenant restrictions\nsuch as allotments, community halls, scout sites, swimming pool\nand sports facilities.\n\n12. The Committee has been made aware that\nin some cases claw back has made right to buy marginal or even\nnegative, in terms of receipts of the LA. Has this been the case\nin your LA? If so give a financial eg. What are the implications\nof this?\n\nWe are not clear on exactly what is meant by\nthe above wording but make the following response which we hope\nattempts to address the issues.\n\n34 per cent of homes in Harlow are still in\nCouncil ownership. The 2002-06 Housing Strategy identifies a £47\nmillion backlog in housing repairs. This is caused mainly by the\nfact that as a new town property tends to full into disrepair\nall at the same time due to the relatively short construction\nperiod and this has been exacerbated in the case of Harlow by\nsome of the innovative, building experiments that took place in\nthe 50s and 60s.\n\nHarlow became debt-free in April 2001, but until\nthat time 75 per cent of receipts from sale of council homes went\nback to the Government. Right to buy in Harlow did not reflect\nthe particular new town issue around ageing housing stock needing\nrepairs and replacement all at the same time.\n\nHaving become debt-free Harlow now has full\nuse of its capital receipts from the sale of council homes. The\nGovernment's White Paper: Strong Local Leadership, Quality Public\nServices proposes that capital receipts from the sale of council\nhomes go into a central pot to be re-allocated against set criteria.\nGiven the backlog of repairs and the specific new town problems\naround ageing infrastructure we feel that it would be inappropriate\nto penalise Harlow Council through becoming debt free and losing\nits capital receipts.\n\n13. Can you quantify the outstanding\nliabilities facing your LA as a result of the package of assets\nand liabilities transferred to the LA on the winding up of the\nHDC and as a result of design and other issues relating to the\nnew town?\n\nThis is difficult to quantify but in 1998 it\nwas estimated that the Council needed to spend £2 million\non its municipal buildings to bring them up to modern standards.\nThere are two aspects to this:\n\n(i) that the infrastructure is wearing out\nall at about the same time so we face large bills to repair or\nreplace the Swimming Pool, shopping hatches, Town Hall, road kerbs,\netc. This is also exacerbated in some cases by the methods of\nconstruction in the 50s and 60s which are now seen to create problems\nin some cases, eg road kerbs and housing;\n\n(ii) that the assets mainly come with covenants\nand claw backs attached so that the Council cannot make the full\nuse of its assets as other local authorities can.\n\n14. How does financial value of the\nliabilities caused as a result of your town being a new town compare\nto the financial value of the remaining assets held by EP in the\ntown?\n\nEP do not directly own that much land in Harlow.\nThey own sub-soil of main roads, Latton Farm and the floodplain\nand Terminus House. We are unable to provide financial evidence\nof this at this time.\n\n15. To what extent has EP participated\nin the regeneration partnerships in the town?\n\nEP has been involved in the Town Centre South\nregeneration programme but its role has been more that of a private\ndeveloper than a regeneration partner.\n\nIn the future there is enormous potential to\nwork with a regeneration body in a more pro-active and supportive\nway.\n\n16. Many of the submissions refer to\nthe inadequacy of the existing SSA to reflect the needs of new\ntowns. Can you detail those weaknesses and set out any suggestions\nabout how any successor to the SSA could be improved?\n\nThe current calculation of SSA for districts\nis relatively crude and based mainly on population. The weaknesses\nof the current SSA can be listed as:\n\n(i) failure to recognise costs associated\nwith ageing infrastructure;\n\n(ii) failure to recognise fully the demographic\nimpact of ageing population on demand for services;\n\n(iii) failure to recognise the impact of\nthe design of the Town on costs: the large extent of open spaces\nwhich the Council must maintain, and for instance the lack of\nprovision for car parking; and\n\n(iv) the design of the Town with major regional\nleisure facilities, such as the theatre, museum, and sport facilities\nis not recognised in the SSA. This is particularly unfair to Harlow\nwhich has very ``tight'' boundaries but undoubtedly provides facilities\nfor many residents of surrounding areas.\n\nHarlow would benefit from a more precisely calculated\nSSA. There is a particular issue about the element in SSA for\n``concurrent'' services, ie services provided partly by Districts\nand partly by Counties. The SSA is based on a national average\ncalculation which effectively transfers money from Districts to\nCounties. We would argue for a concurrent services factor based\non actual expenditure in each area because, as noted above, in\nHarlow's case and we expect for other New Towns the balance in\nfact is the other way, ie the District spends more than the County,\nbecause of the impact of demographic factors (on social services)\nand regional centres for arts and leisure.\n\n17. Has the pattern of the ownership\nand CNT/EP's role had any implication in your ability to develop\na housing strategy for the area?\n\nOnly to the extent that any strategy involving\nEP would need a greater lead-in time than with other partners\nbecause of uncertainty over the covenant agreements.\n\n18. What is the balance between the\noriginal design/materials used and lack of maintenance/resources\nfor the maintenance in the causes of the poor housing conditions\nfound in some New Towns?\n\nMoney was set aside at the time of transfer\nfrom the development corporation but this was severely underestimated.\nThe design and materials used in the building of some estates\nhas left a legacy of work that is only likely to increase. Flat\nroofs, cheap materials and lack of useable parking are some examples\nof the problems faced in Harlow. In addition the social housing\nremaining in council control tends to be that with the highest\nlevel of problems.\n\n19. Has you design led to problems in\ncrime? If so have you looked at ways to design out crime? Are\nthere any funding streams currently available to address this\nparticular problem and if so how successful have you been at bidding\nfor such funding?\n\nSome of the housing estates in Harlow have become\na focus for crime and this has been exacerbated by the design\nissues. One example of this is on the Briars Estate which has\na housing block which has become a focus for young people as a\npolice lookout and the design of bungalows and layout of the estate\nmean that there are a maze of pathways amongst the houses which\ncan act as easy escape routes. The Council is working with partners\nto address the issues on this particular estate and will be seeking\nfunding to address some of the problems caused by layout and design.\nThere are numerous other examples in Harlow of estates in which\nsimilar problems have arisen because of layout which is no longer\nappropriate for the 21st century.\n\n20. What are you doing through your\nLocal Transport Plan to address problems of car dependence? Does\nyour LTP include provision for dealing with issues of design and\nlayout where that promotes car dependence?\n\nThe Harlow Area Transportation Strategy addresses\ncar dependency issues through the following measures:\n\n— Development of strategic bus corridors.\n\n— Flexible ticketing.\n\n— Development of vehicle-restricted\nareas.\n\n— Reduced parking standards for businesses.\n\n— Encouragement of businesses in the\ntown to development transport strategies and commuter plans.\n\n— Provision of community transport.\n\n— Improvements to the bus and railway\nstations.\n\n— Promotion of walking and cycling.\n\n21.

{"text": "Alt Right vs White Supremacy\n\nIt seems to me almost every leftist \"hate group watch\" organization, journalist, and cuck news outlet that attempts to describe the alt right labels the movement \"white supremacist\". Of course, this isn't true. The predominant view in the alt right is one of white nationalism, not of white supremacy. Despite the apparent stupidity of journalists (what else is new?) who are incapable of distinguishing the two, white supremacy and white nationalism are very different viewpoints. As the terms themselves make clear, white supremacists want whites to rule over all other races whereas white nationalists simply want to have their own white nations and leave the rest of the world alone.\n\nI find this particularly ironic, because white supremacy is basically the current system. Globalism is de facto white supremacy. Politicians in the USA, Great Britain, Germany, France, and Russia together essentially control the entire world. Whites only make up about 25% of world population yet hold the vast majority of the world's political power. This is what white supremacy is. The white powers that be in the US (mulatto puppet president not withstanding) have military bases in 160 foreign countries. As evidenced recently in Iraq and Afghanistan, white national governments routinely depose rulers in non-white countries and install their own puppet governments. Neocons support this. Hillary Clinton supports this. The vast majority of politicians in white nations support this.\n\nIn essence, the very same people who are losing their marbles over the rise of the alt right and our so-called \"white supremacy\" are the ones who support actual white supremacy. We in the alt-right are not interested in ruling over third world shitholes. We have no desire to undertake the (probably impossible) task of forcing civilization on the ne'er-do-well races. We'd rather not waste our tax money.

{"text": "Sunday, December 07, 2003\n\nTo improve my fitness and to loosen up a bit of muscle tension, I've taken to swimming once a week. I usually swim at the UQ (University of Queensland) pool, and lately I've been swimming on Sundays in the later afternoon when the sun isn't so intense and things are quite pleasant.\n\nLast Sunday I was riding down to the pool, which is about 20 minutes from my place. Most of the trip runs near the river, which lends a pleasant something to the surrounds, even if it isn't actually visible most of the way.\n\nI was riding along a long flat stretch of road not far from the university when an interesting sight caught my eye. On the other side of the road about 50-100 meters ahead of me there was an older guy on the footpath.\n\nHe was standing side-on to me, leaning in towards some plants -- and there, projecting from his mouth, down and towards the plants was a big, continual spray of water, as if he was one of those water fountain statues, a plant-watering water-statue.\n\nThat image held place in my perception for, probably, a few tenths of a second, before being overthrown by the far more plausable notion that what I was seeing was a visual illusion, probably a result of the particular angle and distance I was viewing the scene from, rather than the sight being the University's latest research into genetically-engineered retirees.\n\nThe more realistic interpretation was that the water was coming from a hose was being held up by something that was actually further away than the man was, and that the nossle of the hose just happened to line up exactly with the guy's mouth. It was like one of those pictures which starts out looking like one thing then suddenly resolves itself into something else.\n\nI had to laugh when I got a little closer and saw what was really going on. Neither of those perceptions was right, and I experienced a third shift of perspective. I had to laugh because I thought I'd seen -- with my second impression -- the truth behind the illusion, and as it turned out the first one was, in a certain sense, actually closer to the reality.\n\nThe water wasn't coming from some source behind him, it did originate from where his head was. At the same time, the water was coming from a hose. The answer? He was holding the hose in his mouth. It was a quite graphic illustration of the ambiguity our perception has to work with, and how interpretations that can seem so right can turn out to be so wrong.", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "ea67c04f-fd43-4011-a850-180670449e80", "url": "http://explorerstreet.blogspot.com/2003/12/triple-take.html"}
{"text": "Tuesday, August 30, 2016\n\nWondering if I Showed Symptoms of Fibromyalgia in Childhood\n\nRemember back when you were in school and had gym class? The topic has come up several times over the past few years and each time it does I am reminded just how much I always hated gym class. Most recently, hubby and I were talking about it when the Olympics were on. We would catch some pole vaulting or hurdles or whatever and I would ask if he had ever tried it. He hadn't but the schools I went to had all that stuff and we were forced to do it all in class.\n\nI truly had a deep hatred for gym class and there were many reasons for it.\n\n1. I hated that everything was a competition. We were constantly competing to the fastest or strongest. Winning was all that mattered. The only thing I was the best at was being flexible. I was always super flexible. Unfortunately, that is not something valued in gym class.\n\n2. I hated that we were never given much actual instruction or enough time to develop any real skills. Sure we got to try pole vaulting but we only had about a 1/2 hour to spend on it. We were told to run with the pole, secure it in the small slot and use that to jump over the bar. Sure, yes, but it's not actually that easy. We would then spent most of the time in line waiting for our turn to try it. We would maybe get to actually try it 2 or 3 times during that 1/2 hour. Unless you are just one of those people who were naturally good at everything (those people were annoying) that wasn't enough time to get the hang of doing something like that.\n\n3. The part I hated the most was that everything hurt. Hitting the ball with a bat hurt my hands, kicking the soccer ball or being kicked by people missing the soccer ball always hurt, catching the football hurt, running hurt my head and my side, crashing into to high bar hurt... Because everything hurt, I was always fearful and tentative in the way I approached every unit because I didn't want to be in a pain for the rest of the day. As you can imagine I was always picked last when teams were chosen.\n\nTHE POINT\n\nDuring a recent conversation with hubby about the various ways I had to suffer through I had an interesting thought. What if the pain I experienced was different from what the other kids were experiencing? After all, nobody thinks being kicked in the shin feels good but it didn't prevent anyone else from going full strength into a herd of flailing legs attempting to make contact with a ball. My legs would hurt for days after just one such encounter.\n\nMaybe this was an early symptom of a developing fibromyalgia. Maybe I always had fibromyalgia but it slowly progressed over my lifetime. It wasn't like I was adverse to physical activity as a child. Quite the opposite. I loved to play outside, go for hikes, jump around, dance. I was very active and energetic but gym class was a regular nightmare up through 10th grade when it stopped being mandatory.\n\nI wonder if any of you with fibromyalgia ever experienced something similar?", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "7dfe3944-b743-4029-a258-321ee79ca05a", "url": "http://migraine-ista.blogspot.com/2016/08/wondering-if-i-showed-symptoms-of.html"}

{"text": "Île-de-France (English:/ˌiːldəˈfrɑːns/, French:[il də fʁɑ̃s] (listen), \"Island of France\"), also known as the région parisienne (\"Parisian Region\"; see Etymology), is one of the 18 regions of France, and includes the city of Paris. It covers 12,012 square kilometers (4638 square miles), and has its own regional council and president. It has a population of 12,005,077 as of January 2014, equivalent to 18.2% of the population of France.[1]\n\nThe region is made up of eight administrative departments: Paris, Essonne, Hauts-de-Seine, Seine-Saint-Denis, Seine-et-Marne, Val-de-Marne, Val-d'Oise and Yvelines. Created as the \"District of the Paris Region\" in 1961, it was renamed after the historic province of Île-de-France in 1976 when its administrative status was aligned with the other French administrative regions created in 1972. Residents are sometimes referred to as \"Franciliens\", an administrative word created in the 1980s.\n\nThe GDP of the region in 2015 was €660 billion (or US$780 billion at market exchange rates), it has the highest per-capita GDP among regions in France, and the third-highest of regions in the European Union. In 2014, thirty companies from the Fortune Global 500 had their headquarters in the Paris region.\n\nAlthough the modern name \"Île-de-France\" literally means \"Island of France\", the etymology is in fact unclear, the \"island\" may refer to the land between the rivers Oise, Marne and Seine, or it may also have been a reference to the Île de la Cité, in which case \"Island of France\" was originally a pars pro toto or perhaps a metonym.\n\nYet another possibility is that the term is a corruption of a hypothesized Frankish language term \"Liddle Franke\" meaning \"Little France\" or \"little Frankish land\", so the modern reference to an \"island\" may be coincidental. However, this theory might be anachronistic, since the name \"L'Île-de-France\" (including the definite article) is not documented prior to 1387.\n\nThe ancient regime Isle of France (then referred as such in English) is one of the historical provinces of France, and the one at the centre of power during most of French history, the province was centred on Paris, seat of the Crown of France. The area around Paris was the original personal domain of the king of France, as opposed to areas ruled by feudal lords of whom he was the suzerain, this is reflected by divisions such as the Vexin Français and the Vexin Normand, the former being within the King of France's domain, the latter being within the Duke of Normandy's fief.\n\nThe old provinces were abolished during the French Revolution in the late 18th century and divided between newly devised subdivisions called departments. An area not entirely corresponding to the historical Île-de-France province was created in 1959 as district de la région de Paris (\"District of the Paris Region\"), the district was reconstituted as the Île-de-France region on 6 May 1976 and increased administrative and political powers devolved in the process of regionalisation in the 1980s and 1990s.\n\nThis section needs expansion. You can help by adding to it.(June 2008)\n\nÎle-de-France has a land area of 12,011 km2 (4,637 sq mi). It is composed of eight departments centered on its innermost department and capital, Paris, around the department of Paris, urbanization fills a first concentric ring of three departments commonly known as the petite couronne (\"small ring\"), and extends into a second outer ring of four departments known as the grande couronne (\"large ring\"). The former department of Seine, abolished in 1968, included the city proper and parts of the petite couronne.\n\nThe river Seine runs through the region, the Seine has many tributaries, including the rivers Oise and Aube. It is France's second largest river after the Loire, the region is in an area of lowland called the Paris Basin. South of this region lies the Massif Central, an area of highlands that are higher than the surrounding countryside but far lower than the Alps.\n\nParis as an engine of the global economy: the skyscrapers of La Défense, the largest purpose-built business district of Europe, with 3.35 million m² (36 million sq. ft) of office space.[4]\n\nThe Paris region is France's premier center of economic activity, with a 2012 gross domestic product (GDP) of €612 billion (US$760 billion), its GDP is estimated to reach €650 billion (US$904 billion) by 2015.[5] In 2011, its GDP ranked second among the regions of Europe and its per-capita GDP was the fourth-highest in Europe.[6][7] While the Paris region's population accounted for 18.8 percent of metropolitan France in 2011,[8] the Paris region's GDP accounted for 30.1 percent of metropolitan France's GDP.[5] It hosts the world headquarters of 30 Fortune Global 500 companies.[9]\n\nThe Paris region's most intense economic activity takes place in the central Hauts-de-Seine department and suburban La Défense business district, in a triangle between the Opéra Garnier, La Défense and the Val de Seine.[10] While the Paris economy is dominated by services, and employment in manufacturing sector has declined sharply, the region remains an important manufacturing centre, particularly for aeronautics, automobiles, and \"eco\" industries.[10]\n\nThe per-capita income of the region is the largest of NUTS-1 Regions in the European Union and is third per capita after Luxembourg and Brussels with $71126.[11]\n\nTourism in Paris is a major component of the regional economy, since the region includes both Paris and Disneyland Paris. The Paris region received 32.3 million visitors in 2013, putting the region just ahead of London as the world's top tourist destination region, measured by hotel occupancy. The largest numbers of foreign tourists to the Paris region came in order from the United Kingdom, the United States, Germany, Italy and China.[12]\n\nAccording to the 2011 census, 59.0 percent of the regional workforce is in commerce, transportation, and market services: 26.8 percent worked in non-market services (public administration, education, human health and social work activities); 8.6 percent worked in manufacturing, mining, and utilities; 5.3 percent worked in construction; and 0.3 percent worked in agriculture.[13]\n\nMedian income in the Île-de-France Region, 2010\n\nThe majority of the region's salaried employees fill 370 000 businesses services jobs, concentrated in the north-western 8th, 16th and 17th arrondissements.[14] Paris' financial service companies are concentrated in the central-western 8th and 9th arrondissement banking and insurance district.[14] Paris' department store district in the 1st, 6th, 8th and 9th arrondissements employs 10 percent of mostly female Paris workers, with 100000 of these registered in the retail trade.[14] Fourteen percent of Parisians work in hotels and restaurants and other services to individuals.[14] Nineteen percent of Paris employees work for the state in either administration or education, the majority of Paris' health care and social workers work at the hospitals and social housing concentrated in the peripheral 13th, 14th, 18th, 19th and 20th arrondissements.[14] Outside Paris, the western Hauts-de-Seine department La Défense district specializing in finance, insurance and scientific research district is the largest dedicated business district in all of Europe and employs more than 150000 as of 2012[update] and estimated to reach 200000 by 2015 and 300000 by 2019.[10] and the north-eastern Seine-Saint-Denis audiovisual sector has 200 media firms and 10 major film studios.[10]\n\nParis' manufacturing is centered in its suburbs: the city itself has 75000 manufacturing workers, with most of these in the textile, clothing, leather goods and shoe trades.[10] Paris region manufacturing specializes in transportation, mainly automobiles, aircraft and trains, but this is in a sharp decline: Paris proper manufacturing jobs dropped by 64 percent between 1990 and 2010, and the Paris region lost 48 percent during the same period. Most of this is due to companies relocating outside the Paris region, the Paris region's 800 aerospace companies employed 100000.[10] Four hundred automobile industry companies employ another 100000 workers: many of these are in the Yvelines department around the Renault and PSA-Citroën plants (this department alone employs 33000),[10] but the industry as a whole suffered a major loss[clarification needed] with the 2014 closing of a major Aulnay-sous-BoisCitroën assembly plant.[10]\n\nThe southern Essonne department specialises in science and technology,[10] and the south-eastern Val-de-Marne, with its wholesale Rungis food market, specialises in food processing and beverages.[10] The Paris region's manufacturing decline is quickly being replaced by eco-industries: these employ about 100000 workers.[10] In 2011, while only 56927 construction workers worked in Paris itself,[15] its metropolitan area employed 246639,[13] in an activity centred largely around the Seine-Saint-Denis (41378)[16] and Hauts-de-Seine (37 303)[17] departments and the new business-park centres appearing there.\n\nThe Regional Council is the legislative body of the region, its seat is in Paris, at 33 rue Barbet-de-Jouy in the 7th arrondissement. On December 15, 2015, a list of candidates of the Union of the Right, a coalition of centrist and right-wing parties, led by Valérie Pécresse, narrowly won the regional election, defeating the Union of the Left, a coalition of Socialists and ecologists, the socialists had governed the region for the preceding seventeen years. In 2016, the new regional council will have 121 members from the Union of the Right, 66 from the Union of the Left and 22 from the extreme right National Front.[18]\n\nThe Grande Couronne[23] (Greater Crown, i.e. Outer Ring) includes the towns of the metropolitan area part of the other 4 departments of Île-de-France not bordering with Paris. They are Seine-et-Marne (77), Yvelines (78), Essonne (91) and Val-d'Oise (95). The latter three departments formed the Seine-et-Oise department until this was disbanded in 1968, the city of Versailles is part of this area.\n\nParis and the Île-de-France region hosts one of the largest concentrations of immigrants in Europe, as of 2006[update], about 35% of people (4,000,000 people) living in the region were either immigrant (17%) or born to at least one immigrant parent (18%).[26]\n\nAt the 2010 census, 23.0% of the total population in the Île-de-France region had been born outside Metropolitan France, up from 19.7% at the 1999 census.[27]\n\n^The flag is the France Moderne coat of arms (a simplified version of the France Ancien reduced the number of fleurs-de-lis to three), emblem of the French Monarchy, symbole of Île-de-France's prominence Essonne taxation Ma the th\n Afterwards in France\n–\nPetite Couronne ranked reconstruction91011 Republicans (France)\n–\nThe Republicans Les Républicains141518.

To facilitate transportation along the Marne itself, a number of canals were constructed alongside. The most extensive was the Canal latéral à la Marne, which runs 67 km between Vitry-le-François and Dizy, river Marne guide Places, ports and moorings on the river\n\n1920. the the Salian Franks from around the 5th to the 10th century was called Old Dutch or, sometimes, Old Low Franconian, compare the somewhat analogous usage, in philological versus linguistic contexts, of Old English vs. Anglo-Saxon. The English term Old Frankish is, for reasons, usually not used in the context of the Ripuarian Franks. It is more used in the Salian Frank and Dutch contexts. The language spoken by the Salian Franks has sometimes referred to as Old West Low Franconian. The Germanic languages are divided into three groups, West, East and North Germanic. Their exact relation is difficult to determine, and they remained mutually intelligible throughout the Migration Period, the language spoken by the Franks was part of the West Germanic language group, which had features from Proto-Germanic in the late Jastorf culture. The West Germanic group is characterized by a number of phonological and morphological innovations not found in North, the West Germanic varieties of the time are generally split into three dialect groups, Ingvaeonic, Istvaeonic and Irminonic. While each had its own characteristics, there certainly must have still been a high degree of mutual intelligibility between these dialects. It is speculated that these tribes spoke a range of related Istvaeonic dialects in the West Germanic branch of Proto-Germanic. Sometime in the 4th or 5th centuries, it becomes appropriate to speak of Old Franconian rather than an Istvaeonic dialect of Proto-Germanic, very little is known about what the language was like during this period. One older runic sentence is on the sheath of Bergakker which is either the singular direct attestation of the Old Franconian language or the earliest attestation of Old Low Franconian language. Another early sentence from the early 6th century AD is found in the Lex Salica and this phrase was used to free a serf, Maltho thi afrio lito These are the earliest sentences yet found of Old Franconian\n\n21.ism\n–\nThe Last Supper by Leonardo da Vinci, 1498, depicts the apostles sitting at a long table.

{"text": "The lie of the year\n\nPolitifact has announced its lie of the year, and I was rather surprised by it. As one might expect, it has drawn some criticism from liberals. The background here is that this year, as in the last few, a lot of political fighting has centered around medical care. The Ryan budget was a large part of that this year, and for good reason. Apart from ridiculous features like increasing the Federal deficit and giving permanent tax cuts to the already low rates for the wealthy, it proposed replacing the current Medicare program with a voucher system.\n\nI think it's important to begin by accepting that there was indeed a lot of Democratic dishonesty on this topic. Ryan's plan specifically exempted seniors from the proposed changes, and many Democratic attacks ignored or outright denied that fact. Politifact was doing their job as fact checkers to point out those falsehoods.\n\nBut that doesn't seem to be the focus of Politifact's complaint. Every one of the statements they ruled false or pants on fire includes language that implies an end to Medicare. The core of their complaint seems be the idea that replacing Medicaid with a completely different program can be called ending it. I think we can all agree that if Medicaid ceased to pay for health care for seniors then it would be accurate to say it had ended or been destroyed, even if the program continued in some other form. Likewise, I assume we can all agree that modest cuts could not be characterized that way. Ryan's plan would replace the government insurance program with a simple voucher, intentionally providing future seniors far less of their healthcare than the current system. People on the old system would have a completely different healthcare experience than people on the new system. So how much could Medicare change before it could said to be destroyed or ended? Politifact doesn't address this.\n\nFairly often Politifact will rate a statement that contains both truth and distortion, and when they reach their conclusion they base it \"on balance.\" The idea is to consider the intent, the underlying point trying to be made as well as the semantic and technical truth. In this case it seems like they haven't even considered balance. The meaning conveyed by the \"end Medicare\" statements is that the government would no longer provide insurance for seniors. That is exactly the intention of the Ryan plan.\n\nI don't fault Politifact for calling Democrats on their language. But they completely neglected to provide balance, to point out that the idea that the statements were intended to convey was actually true. The combination of an overly harsh criticism with no counter balancing explanation has made their analysis of this issue as misleading as the statements they are criticizing. The truth is, the Ryan plan, supported nearly unanimously by the GOP, would indeed \"end Medicare as we know it.\" For people under 55 Medicare would no longer provide health insurance. Instead it would force future seniors to buy health insurance for themselves, and it would pay an increasingly small portion of that cost.", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "c9b8369d-2e98-4e5f-8207-742663fba6a8", "url": "https://notbyrights.wordpress.com/2011/12/20/the-lie-of-the-year/"}

{"text": "Wagner's Tristan und Isolde occupies a singular position in the history of Western culture. What Nietzsche called the 'sweet and terrible infinity' of its basic nexus of longing and death has fascinated audiences since its first performance in 1865. At the same time, its advanced harmonic language, immediately announced by the opening 'Tristan chord', marks a defining moment in the evolution of modern music. This accessible handbook brings together seven leading international writers to discuss the opera's genesis and the libretto's relationship to late Romantic literary concerns, present an analysis of the Prelude, the music of the drama itself, and Wagner's innovative use of instrumental timbre, and illustrate the production history and reception of the music-drama into the twenty-first century. The book includes the first English translation of Wagner's draft prose of the libretto, a detailed discussion of Wagner's orchestration, and rare pictures from important and influential productions.\n\nA magnificent performance of Wagner?s seminal masterpiece, at mid-price. Notable above all for the fiery conducting of Carlos Kleiber, which helps create a reading of unsurpassable power and intensity. Soprano Catarina Ligendza gives a reading of accuracy, stamina, and impulsive drama. Helge Brilioth was one of the best Wagner tenors of recent years, although his career was disappointingly short. His Tristan is one of the best. Kurt Moll and Yvonne Minton are both superb as King Marke and Brangäne. Sir Donald McIntyre, who sings Kurwenal, has enjoyed an international career first in London, then at Wagner?s own theater in Bayreuth. His Met debut took place in 1975 in a Wagner role, and over the next twenty-one years he appeared there in 120 performances, exclusively in the German and Slavic repertoires. Live performance, Bayreuth, July 27, 1974.\n\nOne of the most influential and revolutionary works of the 19th century, Tristan und Isolde, Wagner's music drama of 1865, more than any other work shaped the course of music right up to the early years of the 20th century. The famous 'Tristan chord' that begins the work was claimed by some to be a new harmonic language.Wagner was ever the musical magpie, and his mature style culminated from a close study of the music of Beethoven, Weber, Marschner, Spohr, Bellini, Mendelssohn and Liszt. This is not to underestimate the remarkable achievement that is Tristan und Isolde, and when placing it in the pantheon of compositions that changed the musical landscape, it ranks alongside the Eroica Symphony, The Rite of Spring, and Pierrot Lunaire. Tristan und Isolde is a love story set to some of the most erotic and passionate music ever composed.This first recording made by EMI in 1952 for the new LP format and produced by the legendary Walter Legge was the first major recording to feature the young baritone, Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau. Conducting, Furtwängler excelled himself. Although there have been fine recordings since, this recording has been the benchmark for them all, and arguably has not been surpassed.Further information- 'Furtwängler's firm control and masterly conception of the score and his unfailing response to the subtleties of Wagner's writing are shown in page after page ... I have already praised the choice of Ludwig Suthaus for Tristan ... and Flagstad. It is moving beyond words to hear the great singer, with her art at the height of its maturity, as time bids her say farewell to Tristan.'

His works have helped shape the literature of all English-speaking countries. His work has also had an important effect on the literary cultures of such countries as Germany and Russia. In addition, his widespread presence in popular culture extends to motion pictures, television, cartoons, and even songs\". Shakespeare had an impact on the world. His creations help shaped the English countries..\". In the place where Shakespeare was born had many activities going on especially during the holidays.They had pageants, shows and even plays.\n\n\"The playwright William Shakespeare (1564–1616) is considered the greatest of English writers and one of the most talented creators in history. Today he is the most quoted author in the English language. Shakespeare had established his career in London by 1592, when theater was flourishing in England. He was popular with audiences from a wide range of social classes, who flocked to see his plays\". William Shakespeare is most likely the best English writer and one of the most talented creators in history. Shakespeare started in London in 1592, at that time theater was flourishing\n\n\"One of his best-known comedies is The Merchant of Venice, which he wrote as a \"comicall history,\" that is, a play with a happy ending. The central character is Shylock, a greedy, scheming Jewish banker who cares only about money. Shylock is meant to be a comic figure, and in the \"happy\" ending is his conversion to Christianity\". One of his famous comedies is The Merchant of Venice, which he wrote as a comicall history. Fortunately the play ended with a happy ending, The story was about a character name Shylock who only cares about money..\n\n\"He had retired from the stage by 1613 and wrote nothing in the last three years of his life. Shakespeare made his will on March 25, 1616. In this long and detailed document, he bequeathed his ample property to the male heirs of his first daughter and the \"second best bed\" in the house to his wife. No one has ever deciphered the meaning of this strange legacy. He died on April 23, 1616\". Shakespeare retired in 1613 and had no play written for the last 3 years for his life. In 1616 he made a long document, he bequeathed his belongings to his male heirs of his first daughter\n\n\"Shakespeare prospered early in his career and built his family's fortunes. We know that the coat of arms was granted to him in 1596. He bought properties in Stratford and in London. In 1597, he bought a large Stratford house called New Place. In 1602 he purchased 100 acres of farmland and bought a share of Stratford tithes in 1605\". Early in Shakespeare career he saved up his family's fortunes. He bought properties in Stratford and London. In 1597 Shakespeare bought a house called New Place.\n\n\"William Shakespeare was the third child of John and Mary Shakespeare. His parents had a daughter named Joan, who was baptized on September 15, 1558, but probably died at a very early age, as they also named another daughter Joan, who was christened in 1569\". Shakespeare had two siblings. Shakespeare had a sister that died six years before he was born. Then another sister that was born when Shakespeare was 5 years old.\n\n\"Shakespeare, Drayton, and Ben Jonson had a merry meeting, and it seems, drank too hard, for Shakespeare died of a feavour there contracted.\" Shakespeare died of a feavour in 1616 at the age of 52\n\n\"The final works of Shakespeare's career are best described as \"problem plays\" or tragicomedies—dramatic stories that combine elements of both tragedy and comedy while exploring the complexities of human existence. The plays The Winter's Tale (ca. 1610–11) and The Tempest (ca. 1611)—the last play we can be certain he wrote by himself —address a variety of issues, ranging from the personal (parenthood, friendship, ambition) to the social (politics, sexuality, slavery).\" Shakespeare's last play was described as problem plays . They were dramatic stories that combined tragedy and comedy. They had a variety of parenthood, friendship, ambition to the social (politics, sexuality, slavery)\n\n\"It is likely that Shakespeare began his career in the theater as an actor. This was not uncommon at the time, as playwrights often took an active role in all aspects of their productions. Shakespeare most likely had a financial stake in his drama, considering his name does not appear in other business records of the time. He was a member of two well-known acting troupes of the time: the Chamberlain's Men (beginning in 1594, soon after their creation), and the King's Men (founded in connection with King James I's accession to the throne in 1603). The rise of the public theater—places where paying customers, and not just members in the royal circle, could watch these theatrical troupes—coincided with Shakespeare's early successes. Some theaters in London included the Rose, the Blackfriars, and the Globe Theatre. The frequency with which Shakespeare produced plays in the early 1590s hints that he must have had enough financial success to avoid working as an actor for long.\" Shakespeare began his career as an actor.

{"text": "The art (and science) of assigning Volcano Alerts Levels\n\nPublished September 20, 2015 - 1:30am\n\nUpdated:\n\nSeptember 20, 2015 - 1:30am\n\nSpecial to West Hawaii Today\n\nThe U.S. Geological Survey Hawaiian Volcano Observatory changed the Volcano Alert Level and Aviation Color Code for Mauna Loa Volcano from normal/green to advisory/yellow on Thursday. This change reflects HVO's determination that the volcano is showing persistent signs of low-level unrest. It does not mean, however, that an eruption is imminent or certain.\n\nThis decision followed many months of a higher than normal rate of earthquakes and ground deformation as magma accumulated in shallow storage reservoirs, pressurizing and stressing its summit and upper rift zones.\n\nWhat do these Volcano Alert Levels and Aviation Color Codes mean, and how does HVO decide to change them?\n\nThe USGS Aviation Color Code system has roots in Alaska. During the 1989-90 eruption of Redoubt Volcano near Anchorage, the Alaska Volcano Observatory determined that airlines needed a shorthand way of understanding threats posed by a restless or erupting volcano. So, USGS developed a simple, four-color scheme similar to a traffic light to convey the message.\n\nIn this way, pilots, dispatchers, and air traffic controllers would not need to sift through long text descriptions to evaluate their risk of flying near or downwind of a volcano: Green meant all clear; Yellow meant the volcano is restless, be aware; Orange meant pay very close attention, the situation may be escalating or there may be volcanic ash up to about 25,000 feet above sea level; and Red meant danger, you may need to reroute or cancel the flight.\n\nFor a number of years, this color code system was only used in Alaska where each year one or two eruptions send potentially dangerous ash into trans-Pacific jet flight routes.\n\nThen, in 2006, the USGS' five volcano observatories adopted a single system of communicating volcanic threats across the nation. As part of this unified approach, USGS added the terms Normal, Advisory, Watch and Warning to reflect the danger primarily to people and infrastructure on the ground. These Volcano Alert Level terms were chosen in part to mirror those used by NOAA's National Weather Service for severe storms and flood.\n\nAssigning alert levels and color codes requires that we can measure the activity level of a volcano — from quiet to full-bore eruption. This, in turn, requires that the volcano be monitored around the clock with seismometers, cameras, satellites, and other instruments that can detect signs of magma moving underground or lava and ash actively erupting. With such infrastructure in place, we can, over time, define a background state of typical activity (Normal/Green) so that sustained departures from background are caught in the act (Yellow/Advisory).\n\nKnowing exactly when to change the color code and alert level is not always easy. It's difficult to establish specific thresholds for changing color codes or alert levels. Decisions are made by looking at all monitoring data, patterns of previous unrest and eruption, and considering what is known about the processes occurring at each volcano. Typically, there is extended discussion among observatory scientists before a change is made.\n\nAlert level changes are announced in a USGS Volcanic Activity Notice which explains the reasoning and what to expect next with as much precision as possible. As has been the case for Kilauea, sometimes the alert level designation stays the same for many years. For other volcanoes with different styles of eruption, changes may occur quite often.\n\nWhile the decisions to change Volcano Alert Levels and Aviation Color Codes may seem a bit mysterious, any ambiguity or inconsistency reflects the fact that we still have much to learn about how volcanoes work. Not every eruption, even at our well-studied Hawaiian volcanoes, follows exactly the same pattern. Each episode of unrest and eruption — or unrest without eruption — adds to a growing body of knowledge that helps scientists to issue more accurate warnings.\n\nIn summary, the USGS Volcanic Activity Alert-Notification System communicates the degree and, in some cases, the timeframe of a particular volcanic threat. With this information, public safety and emergency managers, individuals and families, and businesses can take appropriate and timely steps to keep our communities safe.\n\nKilauea activity update\n\nKilauea's summit lava lake level, which fluctuates in response to summit inflation and deflation, varied this past week between 180 and 236 feet below the vent rim within Halemaumau Crater.\n\nKilauea's East Rift Zone lava continues to feed scattered breakouts northeast and east of Puu Oo. All active lava remains within about 5 miles of Puu Oo. Some breakouts are evident by smoke plumes from burning vegetation where lava creeps into the forest.\n\nOne earthquake was reported felt on Hawaii Island during the past week. On Thursday at 12:32 p.m., a magnitude-3.7 earthquake occurred 3.8 miles southeast of Puu Oo Crater at a depth of 5 miles.\n\nVisit the HVO website at hvo.wr.usgs.gov for Kilauea daily eruption updates and other volcano status reports, current volcano photos and recent earthquakes; call 967-8862 for a Kilauea summary update; email questions to askHVO@usgs.gov", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "4b09d4cf-7630-4551-9686-68240f117263", "url": "http://www.westhawaiitoday.com/news/volcano-update/art-and-science-assigning-volcano-alerts-levels"}

Sawyer assistant professor of nursing Penn State and her tea...\n\nPeople with obstructive sleep apnea are more likely to stick to prescribed treatment when a partner or parent is involved with their treatment, according to a team of sleep researchers.\n\nObstructive sleep apnea occurs when the upper airway collapses during sleep. It is the most common type of sleep-disordered breathing, and chances of it occurring become more elevated in obese people.\n\nThe first line of treatment for sleep apnea is a non-invasive in-home treatment called CPAP, continuous positive airway pressure therapy. However, if patients do not use the equipment properly, or at all, it cannot help.\n\nAmy M. Sawyer, assistant professor of nursing, Penn State, and her team are looking for the best ways to encourage patients to adhere to the CPAP treatment.\n\n\"There is inconsistency in how people use and adhere to CPAP,\" said Sawyer. \"Patients are expected to use CPAP for the eight hours or so that they are asleep. Unfortunately, most patients do not use CPAP for the duration of their sleep time.\"\n\nA CPAP machine is connected to a nasal, oral or full-face mask. The CPAP machine delivers positive pressure by air, which keeps the upper airway open and unable to collapse -- a definitive problem of obstructive sleep apnea sufferers. Keeping the airway open prevents drops in oxygen levels during sleep and reduces sleep disturbance. As a result, people treated with CPAP have less daytime sleepiness, better cognitive function and generally feel more refreshed. Treating obstructive sleep apnea also lessens other health risks, including cardiovascular disease and diabetes.\n\nThe researchers were looking at different types of interventions to promote CPAP use, the team reports in the current issue of Sleep Medicine Reviews. Sawyer and her team looked at 80 studies to determine what works and what factors are important to consider when helping obstructive sleep apnea people start CPAP therapy.\n\n\"Collectively, these studies suggest that patients who experience difficulties and proactively seek solutions to resolve problems (active coping) are more likely to be adherent than those who use passive coping styles,\" the researchers noted.\n\nMany different factors can affect whether or not patients follow through on their prescribed treatment -- disease and patient characteristics, treatment requirements, technological device factors and side effects, and psychological and social factors. One of the studies that the researchers reviewed showed that about half of newly diagnosed sleep apnea patients would not use CPAP if it made them feel claustrophobic.\n\nSeveral intervention studies use telecommunications to help patients adhere to their treatment. This method can involve weekly phone calls or wireless telemonitoring of patients.\n\nThe researchers determined that CPAP adherence intervention should be done on a case-by-case basis. If social support is involved -- such as a parent or partner -- patients are likely to continue their treatment. With social support sources providing insight, CPAP users are more readily able to identify their own improvements with treatment. If patients do not have social support available to them, then telecommunications may be a good option for them", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "5253fc81-ca6e-49be-9214-c88696dcd1e7", "url": "http://www.bio-medicine.org/medicine-news-1/Innovative-approaches-help-sleep-apnea-sufferers-benefit-from-CPAP-87474-1/"}

The yield amount that a bond is traded at determines the price. That yield is a yield above the LIBOR known as the spread.\n\nThe larger the spread, the higher the risk of the issuer.

{"text": "Giz Explains: Four Ways Space Can Kill You\n\nTurns out being blown out of an airlock and turning into a meat ice block after succumbing to hypoxia isn't so bad. At least not when compared to the multitude of other deadly maladies that await you in the depths of space. Here are just a few ways that interplanetary exploration is conspiring to kill us all.\n\nCosmic Radiation\n\nWhen stars collapse or supernova, the process throws off vast amounts of high-energy, charged nuclei, which become part of the Galactic Cosmic Ray (GCR) background radiation and diffuse into interstellar space. These nuclei are known as \"HZE Particles\" due to their high atomic number (Z, or the number of protons in the nucleus) and energy (E). While few in number, these HZE particles are both heavy and powerful enough to knock molecules out of joint and ionize biological tissue -- effectively scrambling an astronaut's DNA.\n\nNot only do HZE particles produce chromosomal exchanges (gene swapping within a pair of homologous chromosomes) in the astronaut, which could significantly raise his chances of developing cancer, they have been shown to instigate genomic instability in fetuses as well, much like the after-effects of the bombing of Hiroshima. And those are just the effects we know about. Scientists still have very little data on the effects of HZE particles on a human's central nervous system, immune system and eyes -- especially in micro-gravity.\n\nCorrosive Space Dust\n\nWhen returning from a jaunt across the surface of our nearest celestial body, your first observation probably shouldn't be \"[It] smells like gunpowder in here.\" But for Apollo astronauts Harrison \"Jack\" Schmitt and Gene Cernan aboard the Challenge Lunar Module in 1972, it did.\n\nThe source of the strange smell was moon dust, tracked in from the Sea of Tranquility. Formed by a near constant bombardment of micrometeorite impacts against the Moon's surface, the grey soil is finely pulverized with the consistency of flour. It is some surprisingly nasty shit. It gets everywhere and is highly corrosive. Moon dust had already infiltrated their suits and jammed the limb joints and \"the dust was so abrasive that it actually wore through three layers of Kevlar-like material on Jack's boot,\" Professor Larry Taylor, Director of the Planetary Geosciences Institute at the University of Tennessee, told the Soil Science Society of America.\n\nThe crew breathed free-floating moon dust for their entire journey back to Earth. Schmitt suffered from mild congestion and what he described as \"lunar hay fever\" but the effects lasted less than a day. He was lucky because, as NASA scientists have since learned, Moon dust closely resembles silica dust at the microscopic level. Silica dust is not something you want to inhale; it causes silicosis, or \"stone-grinder's disease\".\n\nSilicosis was first described during the Great Depression after it killed hundreds of miners working the Hawk's Nest Tunnel through Gauley Mountain in West Virginia. Just a few months of exposure to the freshly cut quartz dust killed them in just five years.\n\n\"It was one of the biggest occupational-health disasters in US history,\" Russell Kerschmann, a pathologist at Aames Research centre said. \"You could eat it and not get sick,\" he continued. \"But when quartz is freshly ground into dust particles smaller than 10 microns and breathed into the lungs, they can embed themselves deeply into the tiny alveolar sacs and ducts where oxygen and carbon dioxide gases are exchanged.\" Mucous can't dislodge the particles, and their sharp edges kill white blood cells that attempt to devour them. The patient eventually suffocates due to pneumonia-like fluid build-up in the lungs. Silicosis killed an estimated 16,000 people worldwide between 1968 and 2002.\n\nEven worse: Mars dust. Not only does it have the same consistency of moon dust, it's also comprised in large part of iron oxide, a strong natural oxidiser on par with lye that burns through organic materials like rubber, plastic and human flesh. A dust devil on the Martian surface would likely eat through a space suit -- and most of the astronaut inside. It could very well be toxic too. \"If you get Martian soil on your skin, it will leave burn marks,\" hypothesised University of Colorado engineering professor Stein Sture. \"We don't know for sure how strong it is, but it could be pretty vicious.\"\n\nThe Space Junk Minefield\n\nBetween the US and Russia, we've launched objects into orbit more than four thousand times, roughly one new satellite or spacecraft every month. The problem is everything that made it beyond our atmosphere is still sitting right where we left it -- from the broken bits of failed satellites to shed spacecraft and rocket components like nuts, screws, paint, the 400 million needle-sized antenna the USAF launched in 1963 to reflect radio signals. And it's not just sitting there serenely, this stuff is whizzing about at 27,000km/h, ready to tear through a spacesuit, spaceship or even space station.\n\nToday, there is roughly 5000 tonnes of space junk orbiting our planet (not including the constant waves of micrometeorites the burn up in the atmosphere). We know about the 600,000 bits bigger than a centimetre -- spacecraft can't deflect items that large so we have to track them using radar apertures originally designed to watch for incoming Soviet missile strikes. But even items below that threshold are capable of disabling a craft -- as a cloud of space dust did to Mariner 4 in 1967. And while strikes by objects bigger than that are rare, they are not unheard of. In 1986 a piece of space junk dented the interior wall of the Mir space station's crew compartment. NASA estimates that for every decade that the ISS remains aloft, its chances of being struck by -- and destroyed -- by space junk jumps 20 per cent.\n\nZero Gravity\n\nThe human body is a testament to our species' environmental adaptability. Even in the micro-gravity of interplanetary space, our bodies quickly adjust to the conditions -- bones and muscles that once had to support our weight and power our movements against the ubiquitous downward force of gravity will quickly atrophy. Who needs legs when you can float? Muscles, both skeletal and cardiac, may lose up to a fifth of their mass per week in space. Bone loses one to two per cent of its original density per month, up to an estimated 60 per cent overall loss.\n\n\"The magnitude of this [effect] has led NASA to consider bone loss an inherent risk of extended space flights,\" says Dr. Jay Shapiro, team leader for bone studies at the National Space Biomedical Research Institute said in a press statement. What's more, the calcium shed from your bones collects in the kidneys, often creating kidney stones. This happened to 14 American astronauts between 2001 and 2006 after returning from missions. On an extended voyage to, say, Mars, the development of a stone could not only incapacitate a crew member (as you are literally pissing sharp rocks) but were they to develop in both kidneys and block urine flow, it could kill him.\n\nBlood too is affected by micro-gravity climates. The relative blood pressure differences present on Earth due to gravity (200mmHg at the feet, 70mmHg in the brain) are normalised in space (your blood pressure equalizes to 100mmHg throughout) which causes your circulatory system to freak out, and dump fluids -- as much as 22 per cent of your total blood volume, pissed away in two to three days. \"If you have less blood,\" said Dr. Victor Schneider, a research medical officer at NASA headquarters, \"then your heart doesn't need to pump as hard. It's going to atrophy.\"", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "39135066-9588-4fb0-b950-e901f5efc14c", "url": "https://www.gizmodo.com.au/2013/02/giz-explains-four-ways-space-can-kill-you/"}

Lmost offences were punished by fines, and the levying of fines was the general business of the Sheriff's Court.\nThe Sheriff, sitting in his Court, ordered the arrest of persons accused of grave crimes and tried all offences, even assaults of an aggravated nature, not charged as breaches of the King's Peace. All breaches of the King's Peace had to be referred to the King's Court. The Sheriff sitting in the County Court, or as it was called, the Sheriff's Court, had, till some time after the Norman Con quest, unlimited jurisdiction in the civil affairs of the County.\nWith the Norman Conquest a change came over the Sheriff's Court and the Sheriff or vice-comes as he was then called, became in reality a producer and collector of revenue for the King, by whom he was appointed. In Saxon times the Sheriff had probably been elected by the Freeholders, but the Norman Sheriff or vice-comes was appointed by the Crown and had to show some substantial evidence of his zeal for the Crown. Hence he usually endeavoured to collect as many fines as possible. This made the Sheriff's office unpopular with the public and, when the office was misused for the perversion of Justice, the ill-will in which it was held was greatly increased. The Norman Sheriff was not particular as to details in case of legal transgressions but simply fined the whole township or borough and left the community to settle who was to pay", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "9ac773f0-9850-4997-a93b-2301011dea84", "url": "https://www.bookdepository.com/Interim-Report-Respecting-Sheriffs-Commission-Inquire-Into-Consider-Report-Upon-Best-Mode-Selecting-Appointing-Numerating-Sheriffs-Etc-Etc-1921-Classic-Reprint-Ontario-Legislative-Assembly/9780243158942"}

Mainly because you are more than likely to get more money, and have to do much less work. \"More for less\" vs. trying to sell on your own, and having to work very hard without knowing the tricks of the trade that only experience can bring. What those tricks of the trade are is an entire article, or book, unto itself, but rest assured, any mistake can cost you lots of money in selling too low, or taking too long to sell, or setting yourself up for potential law suits by missing important disclosures.\n\nI'll touch on a few of the key tricks of the trade that you ought to ask about when you are comparing and interviewing Listing Agents. Just about every expert says \"interview at least three listing agents\". I couldn't agree more, even though that means I'll have at least two competitors each time I meet with a potential Seller client.\n\nSo what questions should you ask each Listing Agent? Here are some key ones: 1. How will you attract the most amout of buyers to my home? 2. How will you generate and/or negotiate the highest possible price for my home? 3. What do you do differently than other Listing Agents? 4. Do you offer any guarantees? 5. What is my home worth - show me how you got to that number? 6. What commission do you charge - how does that effect my bottom line?\n\nFrom the above answers you will discover how confident the Agent is, how knowledgable, and you will have much to compare between the three or more agents you interview. One of the \"new\" tricks of the trade is use of the internet to attract buyers. The internet has taken over for print (magazines and newspapers) in a big way, and effective use of the internet is only practiced by a small percentage of Listing Agents even though research shows this is what Buyers use to find homes. If Buyers use the internet, why isn't your Listing Agent? If you're selling on your own, are you an internet expert? Do you know how buyers find homes and what they're looking for?\n\nWhat about commission. The biggest mistake Sellers make is in trying to save commission rather than thinking about how a low commission is more than likely to lead to a much lower sales price. So ask what you're likely to Net in a sale, and how the Listing Agent thinks he/she can get more for your home. But commission is negotiable, and you ought to have a thorough discussion about it. Those that say \"take it or leave it\" ought to be left in the dust. Keep interviewing until you find a great agent who can illustrate how the commission can actually help you sell your home.\n\nFinally, a true testament to whether or not an agent is experienced is in their \"CMA\" or Comparable Market Analysis which estimates your home's value in the current market. This requires market expertise, and is one of the most critical elements in any sale since the CMA is what you'll base your \"Asking Price\" on. Price it too high and you may lose money in the end. In San Francisco, pricing it too low is rarely a mistake, but pricing it just right, is a must to guarantee the most buyers coming through, and the most and best offers.\n\nIf you'd like to interview me to get all of the above answers, then just drop me an email to robr@kw.com", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "8e2809fd-5c16-43fa-9236-9c0cc0a788aa", "url": "http://sfishomeblog.blogspot.com/2006/08/hiring-listing-agent.html"}

{"text": "On September 11, 2012, the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on NASA's Aqua satellite captured this image of fires burning in Tomsk, a region of south central Siberia where severe wildfires have burned throughout the summer. Thick smoke billowed from numerous wildfires near the Ob River and mixed with haze and clouds that arrived from the southwest. Red outlines indicate hot spots where MODIS detected the unusually warm surface temperatures associated with fires.\n\nMore than 17,000 wildfires had burned more than 30 million hectares (74 million acres) through August 2012, according to researchers at the Sukachev Institute of Forest in the Russian Academy of Sciences. In comparison, 20 million hectares burned last year, which was roughly the average between 2000 and 2008, according to an analysis of MODIS data published in 2010.\n\nAnother way to gauge the severity of a wildfire season is to consider the smoke emissions. Fires emit a range of gases and particles into the atmosphere that can be detected by ground-based, aircraft, and satellite instruments. The two most common emissions are carbon dioxide and water vapor; however, incomplete combustion also generates carbon monoxide, an odorless and poisonous gas. In fact, fires are the source of about half of all carbon monoxide in the atmosphere.\n\nThough ground and aircraft sensors provide the most accurate measurements of carbon monoxide for a localized area, satellites offer the best way to monitor wildfire emissions over broad regions, particularly in remote areas where there are fewer ground-based instruments. Christine Wiedinmyer, a scientist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research, has developed a model that ingests MODIS observations of fires and combines them with other information about vegetation (such as the percentage of tree cover and the type of forest) to calculate the quantity of emissions.\n\nIn September 2012, Wiedinmyer used her model to calculate Russian fire emissions for every year dating back to 2002. She found that the amount of carbon monoxide produced in 2012 was significantly more than what was produced in 2010 and the second most in a decade. Through August 31, the model showed that Russian wildfires had released an estimated 48 teragrams of carbon monoxide since the beginning of 2012. By comparison, the model estimated fires yielded just 22 teragrams of carbon monoxide in all of 2010.\n\nOnly one year—2003—had higher overall emissions. In that year, when severe fires burned in eastern Russia, wildfires produced an estimated 72 teragrams of carbon monoxide.", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "38a6b728-3d6d-4c34-b6c1-3aefe2df8bcd", "url": "https://climatechangepsychology.blogspot.com/2012/09/2012-siberian-fires-burn-74-million.html"}
{"text": "Aliens?\nHere's my 2 cents on this one....I'm just gonna pull this from one of my previous posts on this subject....\n\nmpeake wrote:\nThe reason people beleive aliens look similiar to humans is becuase we want them to. We feel that right now we are the top of the food chain and we\nare the best that any species can get. So if there was to be another race of beings out there with the capabilites to travel here and make contact,\nwell, they must be highly evolved like us. So we give them human attributes, like eyes, nostrils, ears, etc...all because we use them on a daily\nbasis. If we use them, why wouldn't they be used on another lifeform?\n\nTo me it's also due to the fact that humans fear the unkown. People fear what they don't know, so to make aliens more likeable in their mind, they\nmake them less unkown. If you were shown 2 different aliens, one with 2 arms, 2 legs, a pair of feet and hands, eyes, ears, and a nose and then show\nthem one with no arms and legs, no human facial features, perhaps a jellyfish like body with tentacles and it dripped goo, which one would you\ngravitate towards? My money is on the humanoid version. We create the version that will be most appealing cause we don't want to fear it. Religion\nhas done the same thing to God. It gave him a long white beard, and a flowing white robe and put him atop a cloud looking down on us. It's all the\nsame.\n\nFurther more, the is a large beleif that aliens take on a reptilian form. This, I beleive, comes from the side of humans that want to place an\nemphasis of fear on the aliens. In general, reptiles are a feared creature. They have been used in myths of man since the begining of time, so it's\nlogical to give aliens a reptlian attribute so that we fear them.\n\nMinime alien stuff doesn't just happen in the US. Cattle mutilations are more common in the US but have been reported in other countries as\nwell. As for UFO sightings, abductions, alien encounters and crop circles etc they have all been experienced by people all over the world. Try a\ngoogle search or read any book on UFO's, there is tons of informationThe probability of life in the universe is low according to what we know\n\nNot true, from a purely statistical standpoint, for example, the Drake Equation, there is an almost certain probablity of not only extraterrestrial\nlife, but other sentient and advanced races as wellThe undeniable coverup of the Roswell incident, remaining as the only time the US Army ever went on record as recovering an extraterrestrial disc.\n(and then of course retracted it)\n\nThere are even pieces of material debris that seem to defy our current abilities of manufacturing (one of Art Bell's guests, should be an easy\nsearch).\n\nYet there's tons of info about where they come from,what tech they use,how they reproduce and communicate...but how do they know?Originally posted by Gazrok\nNot true, from a purely statistical standpoint, for example, the Drake Equation, there is an almost certain probablity of not only extraterrestrial\nlife, but other sentient and advanced races as well.\n\nYes,but we can't say the galaxy is full of intelligent beings can we?And I never said there were NONEfrom a universal point of view there are certainly thousands if not millions oflife bearing planetsI have yet to see a convincing video,except the mexican one I can't think of manygood point\n\nThe undeniable coverup of the Roswell incident, remaining as the only time the US Army ever went on record as recovering an extraterrestrial disc.\n(and then of course retracted it)\n\nwhere is the undeniable proof? if your talking about what the military said about it after the crash (flying saucer) before they said it was a\nweather balloon,it could also be disinformation to cover something else\n\nThere are even pieces of material debris that seem to defy our current abilities of manufacturing (one of Art Bell's guests, should be an easy\nsearch).\n\nI will look it upyeah,I can choose a star and say the same thing and if i am lucky someone will discover a star there providing proof for my alien abduction\nstoryand what if it WAS an error?if what he said was true he would be in trouble for disclosing top secret stuff,no?Funny.My alien 'friends\" never said they were from Zeta reticuli.In fact they were very close all my life.\nGaz, you are not part of the Zetatalk effort are you? Is the \"Seven Sister Pleiadeans\" out of vogue now?\n\nwhere is the undeniable proof? if your talking about what the military said about it after the crash (flying saucer) before they said it was a\nweather balloon,it could also be disinformation to cover something else\n\nWhat would STILL be covered up more than 50 years later? I've given the undeniable proof on SEVERAL Roswell threads, so I won't type it for the\n100th time, hehe...but a quick search would turn it up easily enough.... I said the coverup was undeniable, not that it would prove an alien disc\ncrashed (though there is ample evidence for it)...\n\nI will look it up\n\nWas made of Bismuth I believe...maybe that will help if you search on it...\n\nyeah,I can choose a star and say the same thing and if i am lucky someone will discover a star there providing proof for my alien abduction\nstory\n\nShe didn't just choose a star, she drew an entire star system, one that can't even be seen from her hemisphere!!!\n\nand what if it WAS an error?\n\nVery well could be, but the big picture....\n\nif what he said was true he would be in trouble for disclosing top secret stuff,no?\n\nYes, and he's had police documented death threats, and his life basically ruined in the process of the background erasing efforts (which are spotty\nat best...still leaving evidence of his schooling, etc.) But, it's a weird thing... By going public, if he were to be charged for violating the\nsecrecy agreement he undoubtedly had to sign...then the government would be admitting that he is correct! So, the better solution was to simply\ndestroy his credibility. I can't say he's telling the truth...but I can say with confidence, that somebody has definitely tampered with his\nbackground and made attempts to erase credentials....\n galaxiesOriginally posted by electric galaxiesGazrok - in reference to the drake equation we still don't have enough information on the constants of that equaton to be of any use. While we are\nfinding many planets due to new research methadologies the total number of planets discovered thus far is still much to small to qualify as a\nrepresentative sample. Second while there is ample evidence of water on mrs at some point we have no proof as of yet that life did in fact arise. If I\nam not mistaken the drake equation is\nnumber of galaxies in the unervise times number of stars in each galaxy times percentage of stars with planets times percentage of planets capable of\nsupporting life times percentage of those life bearng planets that give rise to intelligent lfe times the length of time the average intelligent life\nform survives as detectbile times the widow of opportunity of that civilisation being detecabile coincideing with our civilisation.\nThe fact that we dont know enough about planetary formtion to posit how likely a star is to have planets alone is enough to reduce the utillity of the\ndrake equation at this time.\nWhile its a great theoretical model and \"thought expiriment\" there is no way to use it without being able to define the constants of the equation.\n\nOriginally posted by DarkSide98% we fooling our selfe on earth about all those aliens. 2% are merly a sighting of an real alien space craft/Close Observer, and all i have heard\nabout those they are small light balls. 91% are to fast with their conclusions or wannabes.\n\nActually, the Betty Hill map wasn't even drawn from an Earth dwelling viewpoint! It was determined that the map she drew was along the same lines as\nmideival trade route maps but on a stellar level. The map was drawn as one would have drawn it from the point of origin of the route, which, when\ndistances, orientations and various other solar positioning tools where applied, confirmed the stars on the map, and the Reticuli system was found as\nthe logical point. It was also determined that the map was constructed in such a way that the Reticuli system was the only star system from which the\nmap could be drawn and fit the apparent construction of the map. Here's a link to information regarding the Hill case, with some links to additional\nsources:\n\nI was simply mentioning the abundance of sources concluding the same thing...I wasn't taking any of them (except for the certain coverup of Roswell)\nas Gospel, hehe...\n\nForget the Drake equation if you want, we're still talking common sense here... We have life existing on Earth. We're around an average star, with\nbillions just like it in the universe. We know there are other planets around nearby stars. We know the same elements are found all over the\nuniverse. Given this, the odds that life arose on other planets is pretty damn good. From what we know of our only basis for comparison (Earth)\nwe've seen life evolve into sentient life....again, improving the odds for such sentience to rise on another world/s.\n\nWhen you combine this likelihood, with the evidence of visitation that exists (eyewitnesses, photographic evidence, material evidence, documentation),\nit makes a pretty good case that we are not alone here....\n\nActually, the Betty Hill map wasn't even drawn from an Earth dwelling viewpoint!\n\nNever said it was, and that's an interesting point. I guess for me I always liked it because it isn't as if they could be said to have been avid\nstargazers and simply jotted down the stars and picked one....as she drew a constellation she would have never seen in her life....\n\nEDIT- As I haven't done so in a while, did the searches on the map. Somethng I didn't recall before... The map shows the routes taken by the EBEs,\nand appears to indicate that they were investigating yellow stars similar to their own, exclusively...intriguing. Other intriguing notes, are that\neven IF Betty was a gifted astronomer, in '61, the detail of that area wasn't even KNOWN well enough to authenticate her map at the time, let alone\ndraw it!\n\nThis content community relies on user-generated content from our member contributors.

{"text": "Orphan Micro-Enterprise Project\n\nIn North Eastern\n\nThe Orphan Micro-Enterprise Project (OMEP) is a Sheria Based Micro-Credit Project (interest free Loan).This project has been implemented by the IRK Child Welfare Department in Mandera County. Its beneficiaries are orphan from the 1-2-1 Program in the Child Welfare Department. The project was planned in such a way that when the child exits the 1-2-1 program the families have established viable enterprise to sustain the family basic needs (food, education and medication of their children).Otherwise known as an exit strategy.\n\nThe programmes objective is to empower orphans families who are economically vulnerable to enable them lead a self reliant urban life while contributing to sustained economic growth and increase income generation activities among vulnerable orphan households through provision of interest free loans and improving availability of the basic needs in North-Eastern Kenya\n\nThe project is funded by IRK Switzerland. The success of the project is mainly attributed to the identification, design and implementation strategy.IRK is the only international Organization that implements Sheria Based Micro-Credit(SBMC) in the area, North astern Kenya is a marginalized area and there are very few financial institution of which most them are not sheria complaints , in addition to that majority of the population are poor and illiterate (can't read and write), thus they cannot secure collateral to get credit for investment, the introduction of Sheria Based Micro-Credit program was a relieve to many families in the area. The OMEP projects complemented well with other IRK ongoing programmes i.e. Water and Sanitation (WASH), Health & Nutrition, Child welfare, Food Security & Livelihood.\n\nOMEP project beneficiaries are engaged mainly in five different income generating activities. These are live animal trade, animal products and by-products (Hides and skins, butchery, Milk), Retail shops, cross border trade and the provision of equipment and training to artisan with life skills (tailoring, carpentry, masonry, hand crafts and leather work).\n\nThe OMEP project beneficiaries had been selected through a mutually agreed, well designed, and inclusive and gender sensitive and participatory criteria. These beneficiaries were grouped into ten (12 groups) each location was formed into one big group each for easy management and sharing of resources. Prior to disbursement of funds IR undertook various activities that included individual and group profiling, appraisals, market identification and survey, profiling of business service providers and group registration. Other activities before disbursement included constitution, by law, agreements and development of Memorandum of understanding (MOU) between clients, IR, line ministries and financial institutions\n\nThe micro-credit clients were trained on various business and enterprise management and development skills as well as leadership and credit management. This ensured the businesses break even (rate of return) and generated income that provided sustainable livelihoods within and beyond the project period.\n\nIn a nutshell this micro-credit project assisted a total 328 (208 OMEP 1 and 120 OMEP II) clients with interest free loan ranging from kshs. 35,000-45,000 each in of all 12 locations so as to enable them start or expand their income generating activities. The number is expected to increase after and beyond the project life since the money reimbursed will be ploughed back to new clients. The sheria based micro-credit adopted and formalized the informal micro-credit system in the area, which is the informal revolving fund \"Ayuta\" (Merry-go-round)\n\nA total of 4.3 million Kenya shillings have been disbursed to 120 OMEP clients who are engaged in five different IGA activities. in total combination for OMEP 1 and II eight and half million(8.5 million Kenya shillings) has so far been disbursed to 328 clients, the number of clients is expected to grow as reimbursed funds for both OMEP 1 and II will ploughed back to new clients in the waiting list.\n\nThe project was successfully implemented despite a few challenges such as inter-clan conflict, influx of refugee from neighboring Somalia, most of the project beneficiaries are illiterate and hence can't read nor write, thus issue of book keeping especially group record keeping was challenging, but through training and capacity building the project is know well established. The project achieved significantly outcomes. Currently the beneficiaries' can afford to feed their families through the established Income Generating Activities (IGA) from OMEP funds that were disbursed to orphan families. Currently the beneficiaries do not over rely on food aid instead the food aid acts as a supplement. The level of income for micro-credit beneficiaries has improved as indicated by the increased purchasing power, expanded business, access to basic needs such cloth, shelter and food. The health status has also been on a positive trend consequently increased school enrolment and reduction in child mortality among the targeted households", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "fc5bfcbc-9e6d-4180-8065-9c3c5c18423b", "url": "http://islamicreliefkenya.org/portfolio/omep/"}
{"text": "Autonomous vehicles are being billed as a safer alternative to human-controlled transportation and, assuming the hardware functions as intended, that's likely to be the case. But eventually a self-driving car is going to smack into a pedestrian and no company wants to hold the honor of being first.\n\nGoogle's autonomous vehicle arm, Waymo, is working on a solution to mitigate the liabilities associated with such an incident by patenting a softer car.\n\nWhile the application wouldn't necessarily have to be reserved for futuristic computer-driven automobiles, some level of digital analysis would need to be used for the system to work. Essentially, the vehicle in question would use a series of \"tension members†to maintain or modify its structural rigidity — primarily rods or cables. If it collides with a harder surface, the system opts to keep things more rigid upon impact. But if the on-board systems detect something fleshy, the car's structural rigidity is softened up.\n\n\"For example, if it is determined that a bicyclist is about to strike the hood and front bumper of the vehicle, the tension may be reduced for the tension members associated with the hood and front bumper, so as to reduce the rigidity of those surfaces,†reads the patent filing.\n\nSince even the best self-driving car has to cope with the physics of stopping distances, the technology could be useful if it actually works. Still, implementing it might be tricky, as the design would require a fairly complex network of wires and rods in order to function. The patent's explanation is varied and rather vague as to how the computers would control the assembly, and the diagrams aren't much better.\n\nTaken from the patent filing, the above photo represents a bumper (with the top being the forward facing edge) with cables and tensioners outfitted within. Depending on the type of object the vehicle's sensors indicate it's about to impact, slack can be added or removed from the cables to achieve an optimal surface strength.\n\nIt sounds needlessly complex, but the same was likely said of anti-lock braking and windshield wipers when they were first drummed up in someone's imagination.\n\nThis isn't the first time Waymo has considered pedestrian safety in strange new ways. The Mercury News, which first spotted the patent, also referenced an earlier concept where an adhesive layer would be applied to a vehicle's hood, causing a struck individual to stick to the vehicle \"in a manner similar to flypaper, or double-sided duct tape.\" The goal here is that a pedestrian adhered to the hood of a vehicle isn't in danger of being knocked into traffic, only to be hit again", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "27fa5996-9c37-4e7f-8817-671db168c673", "url": "http://www.royaladmin.com/news/not-so-sudden-impact-waymo-patents-a-softer-crashing-car-to-safeguard-pedestrians"}

{"text": "Cataract Surgery\n\nCataract Treatment\n\nCataract surgery has become the most common outpatient surgery performed. Our modern cataract procedures make use of state-of-the-art, high-tech equipment and techniques.\n\nToday's cataract surgery is an outpatient procedure that takes a half-hour or less. Best of all, you'll be back to your normal activity level within a few days. Cataract surgery has made major advancements over the past few years. Before your procedure, a few numbing drops will be placed in your eye, which eliminates the risks and discomfort that is caused by the previously used shot behind the eye. This also helps avoid blurry or impaired vision.\n\nCataract Treatment\n\nThe symptoms of early cataracts may be improved with new prescription glasses, better lighting or effective sunglasses. Once cataracts progress surgery is the only effective treatment.\n\nSurgery is usually recommended in cases where cataracts cause impairment of vision to such an extent that daily activities are affected. Surgery may not be recommended if there are other pre-existing medical conditions, including eye conditions such as glaucoma, which may affect the success of the cataract surgery.\n\nCataract surgery involves removing the cataract-damaged lens and replacing it with a clear plastic lens known as an intraocular lens (IOL). The eye is carefully measured prior to surgery so that the appropriate sized intraocular lens can be selected. The aim of surgery is to restore vision (particularly distance vision) as much as possible.\n\nCataract surgery is most commonly performed as a day stay procedure and is usually carried out under a local anaesthetic with a light sedation. Anaesthetic eye drops or gel may be used. In rare cases a general anaesthetic may be recommended.\n\nSurgery involves making a small incision in the front of the eye, through which the old lens is removed and a new intraocular lens is inserted. There are two main techniques for the surgical treatment of cataracts:\n\nPhacoemulsification Surgery\n\nA 2mm incision is made in the front of the eye and the lens is broken into tiny pieces by a special machine that emits sound waves. The lens is then suctioned out of the eye capsule. In this procedure the back half of the lens capsule (posterior capsule) is left in place to support the new intraocular lens. The much smaller incision required for this technique has the advantage of a reduced healing time. It is the technique most commonly used in the world.", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "dd1d19b4-23fc-4ef1-8645-3593dab45f9e", "url": "http://tmseyehospital.in/cataract-surgery.html"}

{"text": "Researchers Discover that Tears Can Produce Electricity\n\nSiobhan Treacy\n\n02 October 2017\n\nA team of Irish scientists has discovered that applying pressure to a protein that is found in egg whites and tears can produce electricity. The team from the Bernal Institute, University of Limerick (UL), Ireland, has seen the crystals of lysozyme generate electricity. Lysozyme is in tears, saliva and milk of mammals.\n\nPiezoelectricity is a property of materials that can convert mechanical energy into electrical energy and vice versa. These materials are used in many applications ranging from resonators and vibrators in mobile phones to deep ocean sonars to ultrasound imaging. Bone, tendon and wood have piezoelectricity.\n\nAimee Stapleton, IRC EMBARK Postgraduate Fellow at University of Limerick and lead author of The Direct Piezoelectric Effect in the Globular Protein Lysozyme published on October 2 in Applied Physics Letters. (Sean Cartin/.True Media)\n\n\"While piezoelectricity is used all around us, the capacity to generate electricity from this particular protein had not been explored. The extent of the piezoelectricity in lysozyme crystals is significant. It is of the same order of magnitude found in quartz. However, because it is a biological material, it is non-toxic so could have many innovative applications such as electroactive, anti-microbial coatings for medical implants,\" said Aimee Stapleton, the lead author and an Irish Research Council EMBARK Postgraduate Fellow in the Department of Physics and Bernal Institute of UL.\n\nCrystals of lysozyme are easy to make from natural sources.\n\n\"The high precision structure of lysozyme crystals has been known since 1965,\" said structural biologist at UL and co-author Professor Tewfik Soulimane. \"In fact, it is the second protein structure and the first enzyme structure that was ever solved,\" he added, \"but we are the first to use these crystals to show the evidence of piezoelectricity\".\n\nProfessor Tofail Syed, of UL's Department of Physics and team leader, said, \"Crystals are the gold-standard for measuring piezoelectricity in non-biological materials. Our team has shown that the same approach can be taken in understanding this effect in biology. This is a new approach as scientists so far have tried to understand piezoelectricity in biology using complex hierarchical structures such as tissues, cells or polypeptides rather than investigating simpler fundamental building blocks.\"\n\nThis discovery has wide-reaching applications and could lead to further research in the area of energy harvesting and flexible electronics for the biomedical field. Future applications of the discovery might include controlling the release of drugs in the body by using lysozyme as a physiologically mediated pump that gathers energy from its surroundings. It is naturally biocompatible and piezoelectric, so lysozyme may be an alternative to the conventional piezoelectric energy harvesters which have toxic elements, like lead", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "e65fe789-ab73-4746-9dcf-0978c8524de9", "url": "https://electronics360.globalspec.com/article/9988/researchers-discover-that-tears-can-produce-electricity"}

Writing can be extremely painful, and as long as we teach it seperately and not across different content areas, our students will not be considered by leaders like Mr. CIO above.

The controversies surrounding conflicting attitudes toward race and religion, love and marriage, and war and the military in Shakespeare's time are reflected in the tragic plot and thematic ambiguities of Othello. This interdisciplinary casebook is designed to help students and their teachers explore the historical and modern issues related to the play. By combining primary documents with commentary, this guide considers many theatrical, cultural, social, and political concerns at the core of Othello. A literary analysis chapter addresses such topics as the nature of tragedy, the source of the play, and the richness of Othello's language, imagery, and thematic patterns. Three chapters on historical context consider attitudes toward race, love and marriage, and the role of the military in Shakespeare's time, revealing some of the social and political controversies reflected in Othello.\nA discussion of performance and interpretation traces the ways that changing cultural values and artistic expectations have affected the popularity and interpretation of Othello on stage, in film, and in literary criticism over the centuries. A final chapter on contemporary applications expands the focus of discussion to explore how Othello might reflect and challenge perspectives on contemporary stories, including both factual events recorded in newspaper headlines and fictional plots drawn from a variety of storylines in literature. Primary documents include excerpts from Renaissance travel journals, Elizabethan marriage and military conduct books, dramatic criticism and actors' journals, poetry, fiction, and recent newspaper articles and editorials relating to the trials of O.

{"text": "Abdominal pain is very common in children, from infancy and well into their teens.\n\nAs many as 20 percent of all children are afflicted with stomach pains that come and go over a long period. There can be many causes of pain but at most there is fortunately a harmless condition that eventually will heal by itself.\n\nFor the doctor is abdominal pain in children is one of the states where it is difficult to put an exact diagnosis. This is because there are often many and complex causes of pain, and that especially the younger children will sometimes describe the malaise as \"stomach ache\" even if there is another reason.\n\nIt can also be difficult to understand whether it is a purely medical or a more psychosomatic cause of the pain.\n\nGastric Stress in children\n\nSometimes it can be quite easy to understand that there are psychological causes of abdominal pain. This applies if the pain comes when the child joy or dread to something very, or in situations where the child is experiencing a lot of stress. Children who have difficulties at home or at school will often react with stomach pains. The pain is sometimes described by the children themselves as a \"fist in the middle of the belly\" and will often go relatively quickly and then come back in similar situations.\n\nIt also appears that children with long-standing abdominal pain is often more secluded, the school good and dutiful children than their peers. These children may also have additional symptoms such as anxiety and depression. Could there be something in the food?\n\nDifferent types of food allergies and intolerances can also cause abdominal pain. One of the most common are cowed's milk protein allergy in the smaller children and lactose intolerance in the larger children. The child will also often feel bloated and have a tendency to loose stools.\n\nIf the child also seems listless and is poorly absorbed into the weight, it is important to think about celiac disease, where the gluten in a wheat floor leads to a chronic inflammatory disorder of the intestine.\n\nAnother very common cause of abdominal pain in children is constipation. This is often caused by a combination of too little fiber in the food, and the child for various reasons are reluctant to go to the toilet. Children who have a lot of dairy products in their diet, are sometimes at increased risk for constipation.\n\nOther, rarer causes\n\nIn a few children can stomach pain caused by various chronic inflammatory diseases of the intestine, for example. Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. Other children may have a chronic inflammatory disorder of the stomach or esophagus. These children are usually plagued by heartburn and a burning sensation in the diaphragm.\n\nIt is also important to consider inflammatory diseases outside the digestive system as an explanation for the pain. Long-term urinary tract infections can cause symptoms such as fatigue, abdominal pain and nausea.\n\nWhen to see a doctor?\n\nIf abdominal pain is very acute, or has lasted for over three months, one should take the child to the doctor for examination. Sometimes we find disease that can be treated, but in ca. 80% of cases end up without a clear diagnosis.\n\nYour doctor will do a thorough physical examination of the child in the stool sample and blood samples. On rare occasions, it is necessary to further reference to the X-ray, ultrasound and examination of the esophagus, stomach or colon.\n\nWhat can parents do?\n\nIf you suspect that your child reacted to cow's milk, you can eliminate this from your diet for four weeks to see if that helps. It is important to have a diet that is rich in water and fiber from fruits, vegetables and whole-grain products. Make sure your child eats regular meals, and takes your time instead of devouring the food.\n\nIt is also important to take the time to talk to your child about what ev. Ailments that - and together try to find a way the child can cope with problems. In many children's abdominal pain is a way to try to reach out to parents on a day that is often stressful for both large and small.", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "91e44962-3d70-4def-bfa2-a841627bafe4", "url": "http://healthcarechoiceguide.blogspot.com/2012/04/stomach-ache.html"}

{"text": "Essay On Immigration Policy\n\nUnited States Immigration Policy Essay\n\nImmigration policy is a controversial but rarely debated issue in U.S. politics. Politicians usually do not take strong stances on immigration, and rarely does a candidate make immigration policy a key piece of his platform. However, the issue is very divisive and decisions concerning immigration will have a large impact on this country's future. Immigration discussions often evoke strong feelings due to the racial and ethnic issues involved. Often, those seeking to immigrate to the U.S. are part of racial or ethnic groups that are minorities in this country. Therefore, anti-immigration views are often associated with racism and nativism. It can be dangerous, therefore, for a politician or other leader to speak out too strongly against immigration. Even if his opposition is based on population concerns, and not race or ethnicity, he can fall under heavy criticism by minority groups. This effect is partly due to the fact that past attempts to limit immigration were based on racism and nativism. Past opponents of immigration, particularly in the late 1800's to early 1900's, often argued that immigrants were inferior. Anti-immigration stances often evoke thoughts of past nativist movements, such as the Know-Nothing Party. In this paper, I will take a look at various attitudes towards immigration, beginning with Singer. Then, I will give my thoughts on the matter and the policy I feel the U.S. government should adopt.\n\nSinger believes that all developed nations have a moral duty to accept more refugees. He bases this view on his utilitarian theory. Since refugees have a great interest in immigrating to a developed country, sometimes a life or death interest, Singer believes immigration should be allowed until the harm to the host country is equal to the benefit to the immigrants. The United Nations defines a refugee as a \"person who is outside the country of his nationality because of a well founded fear of persecution by reason of his race, religion, nationality or political opinion, and is unwilling or unable to avail himself of the protection of his own government.\" (Singer, p. 250) Singer rejects this definition and believes that those who immigrate for economic reasons should be considered refugees as well. Therefore, Singer believes developed countries have a duty to accept any immigrant who leaves his country due to poor conditions: economic, political, or otherwise. He also argues that refugees make the best immigrants. This is because refugees cannot return home and must fully commit themselves to their new country. In conclusion, Singer believes developed nations like the U.S. have a moral duty to take in many more refugees than they currently do. He writes that \"there is no objective evidence to show that doubling their refugee intake would cause them any harm whatsoever.\" (Singer, p. 262)\n\nGarrett Hardin takes the opposite view.

Columbia University Press. \n\nIt is hard to write contemporary history. Events are still fresh in the minds of the policy makers, lobbyists and researchers who participated, so it is very hard for an outsider, even one steeped in the subject, to organize and detect patterns in what may have seemed to be a disorderly stream of events. These two books can be read profitably by those who want to understand some of the forces shaping US immigration policies at the end of the 20th century. The Reimers book is a broad-brush look at restrictionist groups that want to reduce immigration, while Gimpel and Edwards test a thesis--that immigration is becoming increasing a partisan issue that divides Republicans and Democrats--with an analysis of congressional voting patterns since 1965.\n\nDavid Reimers, author of Still the Golden Door: The Third World Comes to America (1992) and All the Nations Under Heaven: An Ethnic and Racial History of New York City (1996), has produced a useful seven-chapter book that reviews four major types of restrictionist groups: those concerned about the population/environment; rule-of-law opponents of illegal immigration; economic arguments that immigration hurts similar US workers; and those who worry that today's immigrants will not easily be integrated. Reimers concludes that immigration will continue to be debated, as restrictionists and admissionists selectively cite data and studies to support their positions, so that the US is destined to \"produce ad hoc [immigration] policies, just as it has in the past.\"(p154).\n\nChapter one is a summary of the history of US immigration policy, emphasizing that the colonies and then the states advertised for and subsidized the \"right kind of\" immigrants, especially white Protestants: indeed, some colonies levied taxes on ships bringing Catholic immigrants (p 6). Anti-Catholic restrictionism of the 1840s and 1850s is traced to \"increased immigration and rapid social and economic change.\" (p10). In 1875, the US Supreme Court held that only the federal government could regulate immigration, and there followed a series of qualitative exclusions--there were no numerical limits on immigration, but an ever-lengthening list of Chinese, communists, prostitutes and others were barred.\n\nChapter two asks why there was a restrictionist upsurge in the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s, and cites three factors: large numbers (900,000 legal and 300,000 illegal), change in origins, from Europe to Latin America and Asia, and the concentration of immigrants in a handful of states and cities, especially southern California. Chapter three turns to the environmental critics of large-scale immigration, pointing out that most of those associated with the founding of the Federation for American Immigration Reform, FAIR, came out of the environmental and population control movements. Many opposed immigration because they feared that immigration would undo their successful efforts to get Americans to limit fertility. Reimers notes an irony: the 1996 law aimed at reducing illegal immigration includes a provision exempting the INS from obeying environmental laws when it builds new fences and barriers in border areas (p. 62).\n\nChapter four covers abuses of the system. Its first major conclusion is that the 1965 amendments substituting family and economic preferences for the national origins system opened the front door of legal immigration to Asians, and forced Mexicans and other Latin Americans into the US through the back door (p. 69). This is not quite right. There were no per-country limits on Mexico or other Western Hemisphere countries until 1978, and apprehensions did not rise sharply in the 1960s despite a booming economy. Indeed, it is not a coincidence that the late 1960s were the high-water mark of the United Farm Workers in California; the UFW won a 40 percent one-year wage increase in 1966 precisely because there were no Braceros and few unauthorized migrants available, and was able to get grape growers to agree to contracts for the same reason.\n\nReimers paints with broad strokes, which means that important details are sometimes brushed aside. For example, Reimers says that \"many restrictionists accepted 1986 IRCA's amnesty.\" But many more did not, and they on several occasions they came within 10 votes in the 435-seat house of eliminating legalization from the bill that became IRCA (p70). Reimers is at his best describing the evolution of US refugee and asylum policy, noting how interest groups successfully exerted pressure to, for example, give all Cubans, Jews from the ex-USSR and Chinese in the US during Tianenmen, refugee and later immigrant status. He also notes that critics of Temporary Protected Status for Central Americans proved to be correct when they predicted that \"there is nothing more permanent then TPS foreigners.\"\n\nChapter five covers economic arguments to restrict immigration, and it is the weakest in the book. The labor market and public finance impacts of immigration are highlighted as the major points of contention, but the basic theory is not set out, viz, immigration that expands the labor supply would be expected to reduce wages, at least temporarily, and the public finance balance of immigrants depends largely on their incomes, since income is the best single predictor of taxes paid and public benefits received. The research issue is why it was so hard to find in empirical studies the expected adverse effects of immigrants in the 1980s, and why it became easier to find such effects in the 1990s. The answer probably lies in a combination of higher numbers, newer data and realization that immigrant effects can quickly be dispersed through internal migration, as some immigrants and US residents move away from concentrations of newcomers. The economics chapter turns the debate over Proposition 187 in California int o the prelude for 1996 federal legislation, and ends with a discussion of Citizenship USA, the flawed Clinton administration effort to reduce the time between application and naturalization to six months or less.\n\nChapter six covers integration, noting that FAIR and other restrictionist groups want a time out or period of low immigration to promote the integration of newcomers. The chapter then turns to \"English only,\" noting that most laws making English the official language of a state have been only symbolic, and concludes with a discussion of bilingual education. Chapter seven discusses the push for federal legislation in 1996, noting that the impetus came from: (1) the Republican takeover of Congress in 1994; (2) approval of Proposition 187 in California in 1994; and (3) the recommendations of the US Commission on Immigration Reform in 1994-97. Reimers covers one major battle--whether to deal with legal and illegal immigration together or separately (only illegal immigration was dealt with), but does not deal with the other major issue, whether to permit states to bar illegal immigrant children from public schools (eventually dropped from the bills).\n\nReimers concludes that pro-immigration or admissionist forces have the advantage in US debates over immigration policy because, in many cases, they have something to lose, including slower family unification, fewer foreign workers, or more government regulation. By contrast, \"the anti-immigrant movement did not contain many groups and individuals who were directly affected by immigration.\" (p145). The environmental, economic, and integration arguments restrictionists advanced proved to be too complex to achieve widespread support in the face of \"the emotional appeal of America's tradition of welcoming millions upon millions of newcomers, many of whom were poor or seeking religious or political freedom.\" (p145).\n\nGimpel and Edwards have a narrower focus and a more sharply defined thesis: they examine every recorded vote on immigration between 1965 and 1996, and they conclude after seven chapters that immigration policy making has evolved from consensus to controversy, as evidenced by more recorded votes and by close votes, often after emotional debates. The result, they conclude, is a growing partisanship over immigration that in turn mirrors the fundamental distinction between Democrats and Republicans since the 1930s: how much assistance should the government provide to poor people.\n\nGimpel and Edwards make the Refugee Act of 1980 the turning point in congressional politics toward immigration. They argue that the arrival in the US of hundreds of thousands of refugees in the late 1970s, at a time when the US economy was in recession, and refugees were made eligible for welfare benefits, made many Republicans begin to see immigration as adding to the welfare population, prompting restriction.\n\nThe Republican party wants to minimize the role of government, but it is also pro-business, and Gimpel and Edwards argue that the Spring 1996 Congressional debate over whether to separate an omnibus bill aimed at changing the legal immigration system and reducing illegal immigration illustrated the tension within the Republican party over immigration. Seemingly strange bedfellows within the Republican camp, from business groups to the Christian Coalition, opposed dealing with both issues in one bill; this was also the position of the Clinton Administration and most Democratic migrant advocates. In March 1996, these forces blocked changes to the legal immigration system. As one result, the provisions aimed at reducing illegal immigration were probably tougher than they otherwise would have been.\n\nGimpel and Edwards conclude that, with Democrats being mostly admissionist, and Republicans willing to keep immigration doors open so long as the economy is booming and there is little threat that those admitted will need welfare assistance, congressional politics favor continued large-scale immigration of 800,000-900,000 a year. The September 1998 288-133 House vote to increase the number of H-1B visas is an example of the new immigration realities: high-tech businesses wanted the annual quota of 65,000 visas increased when the economy was booming, there was little fear that the professional workers would need welfare, and traditional labor union opposition to temporary foreign workers was muted by a new $500 fee imposed for each hire and labor \"safeguards.\"\n\nChapter two reviews polls on American attitudes, emphasizing that most Americans have favored reducing immigration as long as public opinion has been surveyed. Indeed, the most cited reference on polls and immigration over time concluded that \"it is something of a miracle that so many immigrants gained entry to the US between 1880 and 1990.\" (quoted on p41). However, the authors argue that since most people do vote for candidates based primarily on their stands on immigration, so that narrowly focused interest groups can play a significant role in shaping immigration policy. Farmers and high-tech businesses are identified as effective advocates for more foreign workers, while unions are divided about how much legal immigration there should be, and how much additional effort should be made to reduce illegal immigration.\n\nOther interest groups that influence the congressional politics of immigration include lawyers, ethnic and migrants rights groups, and religious groups that generally favoring more immigration, and population and environmental groups that oppose more immigration. The list ends with two think tanks: Cato and the Center for Immigration Studies, curiously ignoring the Urban Institute in Washington, and the many university-based researchers and centers that have played far larger roles in shaping the conventional wisdom on immigration.\n\nChapter four tells the story of congressional debate over immigration between 1965 and 1982, concluding that: (1) immigration became increasingly controversial, as recorded votes replaced voice or consensus votes; and (2) that the clearest pattern in the shifting positions of ethnic groups, farmers, and minorities is that Republicans wanted to avoid big government (refugee resettlement assistance) and government mandates (employer sanctions), while Democrats favored generous government assistance to all poor residents, including immigrants and refugees.\n\nChapter five turns to the 1982-94 period, the era of both IRCA and IMMACT. Both laws substantially increased immigration--IRCA with an amnesty, and IMMACT by raising the world wide immigration ceiling, and permitting the ceiling to be readily exceeded. As the story of IRCA's passage is recounted, it is noteworthy how many times the generous aspects of IRCA, such as amnesty for illegal aliens in the US, were almost defeated (legalization remained in IRCA in the House by 216-211 and 199-192 votes), and how hard it was to win approval of an effective employer sanctions system (the House approved a call-in employer verification system on a 242-155 vote (p162), but it was later dropped because of the opposition of the Hispanic caucus and the representatives who had taken the lead on immigration reform, who objected to its cost). Overall, we are reminded that it proved far easier for the Senate than the House to approve IRCA's Grand Bargain of sanctions and amnesty.\n\nThe second half of chapter five recounts the politics of IMMACT, noting that Republicans were eager to emphasize the selection of immigrants on the basis of their skills and potential economic contributions, while Democrats, especially Senator Ted Kennedy (D-MA), wanted to increase immigration from Europe, especially Ireland. The House and Senate approved bills to increase legal immigration, and the compromise was to establish a ceiling of 675,000 immigrants a year, beginning in 1995, including 140,000 visas a year for immigrants (and their family members) selected for economic/employment reasons. This ceiling can be and has been exceeded each year since 1995.\n\nChapter six turns to the IIRIRA, focusing on the coming together of business groups with migrant advocates to prevent reform of legal immigration. During the spring and summer of 1996, as Congress prepared to approve three major pieces of legislation affecting immigrants, the debate in Congress centered on the Gallegly amendment, which would have permitted states to deny free K-12 schooling to illegal alien children, and the Leahy amendment eliminating \"expedited removal\" from the Senate bill--expedited removal permits the INS to refuse entry to foreigners who arrive with no or false documents and request asylum in the US. The Gallegly amendment was removed from what became IIRIRA before enactment, but expedited removal was included.\n\nIn 1997-98, some of the restrictions introduced in the 1996 anti-terrorism, welfare, and immigration reform laws were relaxed, including restoration of welfare benefits to some legal immigrants, and immigrant status or easier rules for some Central Americans and Cubans and Haitians to appeal to stay in the US. Late in 1998, Hurricane Mitch caused severe damage in Honduras and Nicaragua, leading to TPS for nationals of these countries in the US-- perhaps the start of conversion of temporary migrants into permanent residents.\n\nThere is likely to be little significant new immigration legislation in 1999-00. The Clinton administration will likely push to restore more of the welfare benefits taken from legal immigrants in 1996, and farmers will make a renewed push for an easy access temporary worker program. However, the major congressional priorities seem to be checking on how well the INS is fulfilling its missions, and examining the economic progress of immigrants. This last issue reflects another fundamental partisan difference. Is it better to permit easy entry, and let the market determine wages and incomes, or is it the responsibility of government to ensure minimum wages and above-poverty incomes, so that immigration does not work against achieving these goals?\n\nIf immigration has shifted from consensus to controversy, with increasing partisanship, what are the likely impacts? Are there other policy issues that might provide a guide to predicting the course of immigration policy? The minimum wage might serve as an example. The 1938 Fair Labor Standards Act put a floor under wages in an effort to \"create a level playing field\" at the bottom of the labor market and raise the incomes of the working poor. The minimum wage is generally favored by Democrats and opposed by Republicans, and each points to legions of studies showing that wage and income protection can be bought with little loss of jobs or competitiveness, or , on the other side, that the minimum wage is a job and business killer.\n\nAs a result, each party tries to maximize its version of minimum wage policy when it has the political power to do so, with Democrats pushing for high minimum wages, few exceptions, and vigorous enforcement, while Republicans tend to advocate the opposite positions. As a result, minimum wage policy oscillates, as a pendulum. Immigration policy may do likewise in the 21st century.", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "848567ce-8e0f-4fa7-adfe-339c26d78c77", "url": "http://sjitjys.chytrak.cz/64-essay-on-immigration-policy.php"}

But the excitement among the audience is palpable – the subject of the lecture is dinosaurs.\n\nThe students awaiting the arrival of the lecturer, LMU paleontologist Dr. Oliver Rauhut, in the Audimax are considerably younger than the audiences he is accustomed to. Girls and boys between the ages of 8 and 12, who have registered for the Children's University, are eager to hear the first lecture in the new semester, entitled \"Dinosaurs – Mystical Monsters of the Mesozoic\". Moreover, their reaction to the Introduction shows that they are genuine students. They know that real students don't clap at lectures. They express their approval by politely knocking on the desktops with their knuckles.\n\nThe fascination of feathered dinosaurs They had other occasions to applaud during Oliver Rauhut's presentation. He began by telling them that he had just come back from a trip to Austria to recover a dinosaur fossil that weighed 120 kilograms – and gave him lots of heavy lifting to do. \"People who use brushes in their excavations are archaeologists. They are sometimes confused with paleontologists, but paleontologists tend to work with jackhammers and stone saws,\" he remarks, with a grin.\n\nThe great attraction of Children's University lectures for Rauhut is the unbridled enthusiasm of the audience. \"You can really see their eyes light up when they get the point,\" he says. And it's not just the lecturer in front of the class who notices this. As Rauhut explains that birds are direct descendants of dinosaurs a perceptible murmur of amazement ripples through the lecture hall. The kids are further astonished to hear of Rauhut's latest research findings, which show that dinosaurs had feathers. Eight-year-old Carl, who is attending his first lecture at the Children's University, is fascinated to hear that some dinosaurs even resembled modern birds in appearance. For him the take-home lesson is that ideas about what dinosaurs were really like have changed a lot recently. \"People used to think that dinosaurs lived in water,\" he explains. He also marvels at the idea that one can work out on the basis of fossil footprints whether dinosaurs plodded slowly across the landscape millions of years ago or zipped along at a brisk running pace.\n\nRauhut is delighted that his young hearers have had the opportunity to learn so much that is new, because much of what they read about dinosaurs in books is simply wrong. And although this experienced lecturer admits to having been a little nervous beforehand, he now says he wouldn't hesitate to give other talks at the Children's University – and not just for the pleasure of observing the sudden dawning of those \"aha\" effects.\n\nFour more light-bulb lectures for kids At the Children's University, the new semester has just got underway. Four more established researchers are preparing to astound a young and inquiring public in the coming months. The next lecture is scheduled for the beginning of November, and will be given by Leibniz Prizewinner Professor Erika von Mutius, who will explain why children in farming families live healthier lives than city kids do. (Hint: The difference has a lot to do with cows.) Later in the month physicist Professor Tim Liedl will give a lecture on DNA, the thread of life. The differences between analog drawing with pencil and paper and digital painting with the help of computer programs will be the topic of the lecture entitled \"Grab that Mouse – Painting with Digital Brushes\", to be given by Anja Mohr, Professor of Art Education at LMU, early next year. In the final lecture in the series (\"No, I'm Not Getting Up\"), chronobiologist Professor Till Roenneberg explains why it is so difficult to get up in time for school in the morning. Naturally, all lectures at the Children's University are given in German.", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "28145a7b-0ad6-404a-89bd-eb51f316045d", "url": "http://www.en.uni-muenchen.de/news/spotlight/2013_articles/kinderuni.html"}

{"text": "How parents can make the most of your child's preschool experience, including expert advice on potty training, toddler discipline, preschool development, leading by example, and other practical parenting tips.\n\nThursday, July 22, 2010\n\nTime Management Tips for Parents with Newborns\n\nI spoke with Maryanne Bourque, MS, RN, Community Education Coordinator at Nemours/Alfred I. duPont Hospital for Children in Wilmington, DE about time management with new baby in the house. Here is what she said:\n\nHaving a new baby can be overwhelming for even the most organized woman. A few tips: • Keep it simple and keep it realistic! Although there are supermoms who seem to have it all together immediately upon leaving the hospital with their new bundle of joy, the reality is it takes some organization, some realistic goals and some help to manage your time. • For the first few weeks, remember your body is healing. Try to limit visitors' time in visiting you and number of visitors. If they ask what they can bring, tell them to bring lunch (a small rotisserie chicken, a bagged salad and a baguette from the grocery store can be a real treat!) If family members offer to help, let them come and hold your colicky baby one afternoon while you try and take a quick nap. Let Daddy feed, bathe or put the baby to sleep for the evening - it helps him bond and gives Mom a break. In other words, let people help you - it doesn't mean you can't do it by yourself and people like to feel as if they're truly helping.\n\n• Once you're a few weeks out from the delivery and you're ready to venture out more often, try to get and stay organized: o When putting clean laundry away, put a clean outfit or two right into the diaper bag. Make sure there's a good supply of diapers, wipes and pacifiers. o If you're going back to work, try to get ready the night before by laying out clothes for you and the baby (and siblings if this isn't your first!) pack your lunch the night before and keep it in the fridge till morning, throw anything related to errands in the car (dry cleaning, grocery list.) o Make and keep two essentials: a calendar and a \"To Do\" list. On the calendar, plug in all appointments, work meetings, social functions so that you'll be able to plan your day, week and month. In keeping this calendar, though, remember flexibility is key - if neither you nor the baby slept the entire night, you may need to reorganize your day. Concentration on tasks may suffer from lack of sleep and being focused on your new baby, a \"to do\" list helps keep things top of mind. • Other tips that may help: o Keep things where they belong (keys by the door, coat hung up, purse and diaper bag in the same place) o When scheduling things on the calendar, schedule time for yourself (even if it is only 30 minutes a couple times a week) to do something just for you (read a book, take a bath, get a pedicure). When you're comfortable leaving the baby for an hour or so with a trusted family member or sitter, schedule a date night with your partner - it's important to stay connected and communicating. Even if you just take a walk together for 30 - 60 minutes, the time spent alone together is very important. o When cooking, try to keep to healthy things as much as possible: buy pre-cut veggies, when cooking a meal, double the recipe and freeze half so that you'll have a meal already made to pull out on a busy day. Thanks to Maryanne for some important and practical advice. As the mom of three kids, I remember those days fondly, even though it was difficult at the time.

{"text": "Lumber Jacks and Wood Milling Companies\n\nMonth: January 2017\n\nIn the procedure of lumbering standing timber there are four processes in completing this transaction. First, it begins with a homesteader or developer assigning an area of the wooded land to be farmed out of a forest. Or an independent contractor will cut and sell logs to a wood mill. The commercial wood mill will handle the entire process from logging the timber through the sale of the wood. Before the use of modern technology, logging typically was limited to the winter months. Lumber jacks would cut down the trees and draft horses were used to pull and hauled the lumber, by wagon, from the drop point to the pick-up point near a river. Then, the logs floated down river to the railroad station, where it was taken to the designated milling yards. Eventually, vehicles were incorporated in the delivery process in lieu of horses. The use of trucks and railroads made the lumbering process more safe and efficient. This advancement in transportation allowed lumberjacks to cut and move the lumber year-round, rather than just during the winter months.\n\nAt the milling yards, the cut wood was then processed to be sold. This process was, and still is, referred to as wood milling. Milling is the method of using rotary cutters to remove material from the wood. There are a variety of equipment used in the manufacturing of logs into usable lumber. After the logs are scaled, a sawyer uses a head saw to break the logs into unfinished planks. An edger is used to trim off all irregular edges leaving a four-sided lumber. The wood is then planed to smooth the surface of the lumber, thereby leaving a uniform width and thickness. After this process is completed it can then be shipped to market.\n\nManufacturing wood products included cutting the logs into usable lumber and other wood products, such as; particle boards, barkdust, oriented strand board and wood pellets. The logs would be cut down the length of it to create even, straight pieces. These pieces of wood were intended for building homes, businesses and other structures. Steam powered cutting systems were linked to belts. These mechanical systems could drive a series of saw blades that would increase the output of cut boards immensely.\n\nAfter the logs are processed at the wood mills, the cut boards and pieces are sold to lumber companies. These lumber companies will either sell to public or private sectors of the population. The transported wood products are taken by a buyer to a market. There, the buyer will sell the wood to select wood companies. The small mills sell to the local people who often will transport the wood home on their own, using trucks and other large vehicles. The wood that is left over from the local sales would then be taken to various distant markets by sailing ship, rail and then, eventually, delivery trucks.\n\nWith the advancement of milling tools, technology has played a significant role in expediting the process in manufacturing wood to be sold and used in production. Some of these advanced tools can be viewed and bought as conventions, expositions, conferences and trade shows. At these trade shows, the wood products industry will feature the wood and sawmill equipment that can be sold and bought by various milling companies. At these events you can expect to see numerous of attendants involved the lumber industry from lumber jack companies to equipment manufacturers. They will showcase their products and samples using big attractive booths complimented with small items such as lightweight trade show tables to place literature, giveaways or other samples. So it is important to use all the opportunities to present your company at a trade show, so don't hesitate to utilize trade show accessories. To have a better idea of a range of these products you can visit \n\nAlso it is important to choose the right event in this field. Some of the best lumber events include the Sierra-Cascade Logging Conference, the Mississippi Lumber Manufacturers Association Annual Meeting, PaperWeek Canada and the Lumber and Building Material Expo. The logging industry associations and groups production events hosts these trade shows to display and sell the newest technological equipment used in the wood industry.\n\nEvery year millions of cubic metes of wood is used in construction, furniture, flooring, creating musical instrument, sports equipment, etc. Properties of the wood differ depending on what wood species are used. The difference between species is seen in color, water resistance, hardness, flexibility, ability to carry a load and other. Here is a list of the most popular wood harvested in the USA\n\n1. OAK tree\n\nOak tree (the mighty oak) was selected as the official national tree of the United States in 2004. The tree can be found in almost every State in the U.S. There are roughly 60 wood species of the oak tree in the United States. The different species can be categorized into white and red oak. The tree is recognized for its excellent shade, high-quality lumber, and beauty.\n\nProperties: The Oak tree grows well in hot and humid climates. Oak trees are harvested after they reach a height of roughly 45 meters. The oak wood species is strong, thick, and light colored hardwood. The oak wood has a coarse texture and fine grain due to its outstanding rings and large pores.\n\nUses: Oak Wood is used to craft American designs. Also, the Oak is used for Gothic and William & Mary designs as well as other contemporary crafting designs.\n\n2.Mahogany\n\nMahogany is a tropical hardwood tree found in South and Central America. There are various grades and wood species which vary in term of quality and price.\n\nProperties: Mahogany is believed to be the strongest, hardest and best quality wood. Mahogany wood tends to be brown in color and may exhibit stripe, ribbon, rope ripple, or blister figures. It takes about 25 years for mahogany trees to be harvested\n\nThere are five common maple wood species in the U.S. These species include red maple, sugar maple, and hard rock maple.\n\nProperties: The hard and resistant properties of maple make it ideal for creating bowling alley floors. The wood has a fine texture and even grain due to its evenly sized pores. Maple wood with curly grains is usually used to design violin backs.\n\nUses: American colonial furniture is made from maple wood. Also, the wood can be stained to produce cherry wood.\n\n4.Walnut tree\n\nWalnut is the most popular hardwood tree in North America.\n\nProperties: The wood color ranges from light to dark chocolate brown with wavy grain on the roots. The relatively thick wood is hard, strong and durable. It boasts of amazing woodworking qualities and excellent finishes.\n\nUses: The easy to carve and smooth walnut wood is used to make elegant cabinets.\n\n5.Cherry Tree\n\nThe cherry tree also referred to as fruitwood can be found in the Washington, Michigan, Wisconsin, Oregon and the California States.\n\nThe Japan gave 3,020 cherry trees to the United States as a gift of friendship. The First lady planted the first two cherry trees at the bank of the Tidal Basin. The National Cherry Blossom Festival celebrates the 1912 gifts of cherry trees and marks the lasting friendship between Japan and the U.S. This festival has made the Cherry Tree famous across the United States.\n\nProperties: Cherry tree tends to be moderately hard and reddish-brown in color. The straight-grained, durable, and light-weight wood is easy to polish, and carve cherry wood.\n\nUses: there is a high demand for cherry lumber which is used to make cabinets and furniture. Additionally, the Cherry wood species is used for wall paneling, handles, toys, interior trim, flooring, and veneers.\n\nLumber companies have existed for hundreds of years, and are often given a bad reputation. Many consumers believe that lumber companies are bad for forests, woods, and other natural habitats. But in reality, lumber companies do not deplete the Earth's resources. Modern lumber companies take a much more green approach to logging, offering several recycling options and learning how to reuse wood for different projects. Timber and lumber can be used in a variety of ways, and they can help keep other resources green as well. If you're in the business of selling lumber, veneers, laminates, timber, and more, these core values and tips of being a green lumber company are a must-read.\n\nBuying Replant Wood Can Save\n\nIf you're a modern lumber company, you can buy your wood from select timber companies that work in replant forests. These timber companies will actually replant their wood, growing their own trees in designated farms. That way, they are not contributing to the disaster of deforestation, and they are creating a sustainable business by reusing each plot of soil. Timber companies create their own tree farms to be reused time and time again, and they can sell you timber for a cost-effective option.\nAnother valuable option for green lumber companies is to buy timber and wood from companies that sell dying tree parts. Trees that are dying will already be discarded anyway, so it can be useful to claim this wood and put it to good use. The wood can be good for scraps, reclaimed furniture, and other useful projects.\n\nGreen Laminates Exist\n\nLaminates, in the traditional sense, are not made using green methods. Laminate and vinyl wood flooring can hurt the environment to make. However, you can achieve a green hardwood floor project by buying from companies that produce a laminate with greener materials. Nowadays, many different types of hardwood flooring – whether it's bamboo, oak, cherry, pecan, or more, can be made from sustainably harvested, reclaimed, or recycled resources. These reused materials are much less harsh on the environment and can help to reduce your company's carbon footprint.\n\nLumber Veneers\n\nVeneer lumber is typically made from engineered wood practices, using thin layers of wood and many adhesives that are not environmentally friendly. However, more and more modern lumber companies are thinking of new ways to make veneers that don't do as much damage to the environment. Much like laminates and timber, veneers can be made with recycled and reclaimed wooden resources and can be put together using adhesives that do not contain as many damaging chemicals.\n\nGreen Lumber is the Future\n\nBy employing modern and safe environmental practices, you can ensure that your lumber company can stay green and still turn a profit. These core values of being a green lumber company will help your company be more sustainable in the long run. By receiving timber, lumber, veneers, and laminates from reclaimed wood, you are using safe practices that do not cause deforestation. With recycled wood, replant facilities, and discarded timber uses on the rise, it is proof that green lumber companies are the path to a sustainable future.", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "358fbbe0-2038-469d-9770-bc0eca49ebb9", "url": "http://www.olympicforestproducts.com/2017/01/"}

{"text": "Search\n\nASU Law professor says political pacts should be kept\n\nPresident Donald Trump is considering backing out of the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act of 2015. Many believe it could leave the United States a diplomatic pariah if he follows through.\n\nTrump says he will make a decision this week, which has led to wide speculation about sanctions, soured relationships and the future implications of multinational pacts.\n\nTo seek answers, ASU Now turned to Sandra Day O'Connor College of Law Professor Daniel Bodansky, an expert in international law.\n\nDaniel Bodansky\n\nQuestion: President Trump has been talking about scrapping the Iran nuclear deal, which was struck in 2015 before he took office. Good or bad move, and why?\n\nAnswer: This raises two questions: First, is scrapping the agreement legal and, second, is it a good idea? The Iranian Nuclear Agreement is not a legal agreement but a political agreement. It doesn't have the status of a treaty, and it's not binding in the area of international law. Presidents have quite a bit of authority to terminate legal agreements like treaties, but they have even more authority to terminate political agreements. So, yes, as a legal matter, President Trump is able to terminate the agreement.\n\nBut that doesn't mean terminating the agreement would be a good idea. Opinions about the deal differ, but in my view the overriding idea of the agreement was to curb the Iranian nuclear program and it's been successful in doing that. The agreement hasn't curbed Iran's support for terrorism and activities in the Middle East — it wasn't intended to do that. Like most agreements, it can't do everything. However, pretty much everyone agrees that Iran has been complying with the limits on its nuclear program. There's very strict monitoring under the agreement, and there's no evidence of violations.\n\nQ: What are the foreign-policy repercussions if the United States pulls out of this agreement?\n\nA: Two kinds of implications. First, pulling out of the Iranian agreement would make it much more difficult to do a negotiation with North Korea because even if an agreement was reached, if Trump pulls out of the Iranian deal, it means that he very well might pull out of a North Korean deal as well. North Korea will be less likely to want to strike a deal with the U.S. if they feel we might change our mind later.\n\nThe second implication is for our relationships with our allies in Europe who support the agreement. Pulling out of the Iran deal will obviously undermine relationships with European countries and make it more difficult to work together on issues like North Korean in the future.\n\nQ: What would pulling out of the Iran nuclear deal achieve?\n\nA: It's not clear whether Congress will re-impose sanctions on Iran, so it may be more symbolic than anything else. Also, if our allies don't re-impose sanctions, any sanctions imposed by the U.S. would be a lot less effective than previously. It seems as if Iran is holding up its end of the bargain, so if the sanctions were proposed again by the U.S., we'd probably be going it alone at this point.\n\nQ: How does a political deal like the Iran agreement differ from a treaty like the North Atlantic Treaty that established NATO?\n\nA: The North Atlantic Treaty was intended to establish legal obligations and be governed by international law. In contrast, the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action was intended to create only political commitments.\n\nTop photo courtesy of Pixabay\n\nArizona State University\n\nArizona State University is a top ranked research university in the greater Phoenix metropolitan area.", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "00ebd682-ac59-4259-a9b1-ef4250d2c6ff", "url": "https://campus.asu.edu/content/asu-law-professor-says-political-pacts-should-be-kept-0"}

{"text": "How it Works\n\nWhat is Guided Meditation?\n\nGuided meditation is when you are guided, by a narrator, to elicit a specific change in your life. You are first guided to relax your body and mind, to help you reach a deep meditative state before going on a journey, in your mind, to reach a specific goal.\n\nAs the brain does not distinguish between an imagined event and a real one, the experience you have with a guided meditation is just like having a real experience. This has an amazing effect on your life due to the way the brain works.\n\n\"the brain does not distinguish between an imagined event and a real one\"\n\nThere are many studies that show that practicing something in your mind is almost as good as practicing it in real life.\n\nThe beauty of a guided meditation is that you can bring about change in your body by using your mind, and that means activating muscles, changing your biological state, and even changing the way the cells in your body work.\n\nSounds too amazing to be true! We have researched guided meditation for years now, and spent over a year developing the downloads and MP3s to perfect them, in order for them to get the change you desire in your life.\n\nAll you have to do is listen for twenty minutes per day to bring about the change you desire.\n\nHow Guided Meditation Works\n\nGuided meditation is an extremely powerful way of eliciting change in your life, due to the nature of the way the brain works.\n\nWhen you experience something in real life your brain changes it's neural pathways, and will pass on information to your subconscious mind to store for future use.\n\nFor example if you wanted to become great at learning languages, your brain has already stored previous experiences of you trying to learn a language. If the experience was good you will be better at learning, if your experience was bad the chances are it will be very difficult to learn a new language. What guided meditation helps to do is reprogram your mind by directly accessing your subconscious mind and give it a new, better experience.\n\nYour brain does not distinguish between a real event and an imagined event. So if you imagine something in your mind, your brain takes it that you've actually experienced what you were imagining and forms new neural pathways to be stored for future use.\n\n\"This has huge implications in the field of personal development as there is really no limits what we can achieve\"\n\nWhat's really exciting is that studies have shown that when we are trying to get better at sports and we imagine practicing the sport in our mind, the muscles in your body are being activated and actually strengthen as a result. This has huge implications in the field of personal development as there is really no limits what we can achieve.\n\nWhat guided meditation does is give you an new, better experience by having a narrator guide you through a scene in your mind. These scenes are always positive and will change your brain's neural pathways to install a great experience for you.\n\nWhat Is In Each Download and CD?\n\nAll the guided meditations at GuidedMind last for around 20 minutes. This was a conscious decision as we know that everyone is extremely busy and we wanted you to have an amazing experience without spending too much time. 20 minutes per day is all it takes to help you change your life. The exception to this are our sleep downloads which last for 30 minutes.\n\nThere are three sections to each guided meditation:\n\n1. Relaxing Meditative Session\n\nIn the first section you will be given a complete mind and body relaxation session.\n\nThis will help you to reach the meditative state required to access your subconscious mind.\n\n2. Visualization Deepener Session\n\nThis session will guided you through a beautiful scene in order to strengthen your visualization skills.\n\nIt will also allow you to go deeper into the meditative state in preparation for the next session.\n\n3. Life Goal Session\n\nThe last session is where you will be guided through a specific scene in order to reach a desired goal in your life.\n\nIt is here that the magic really happens, and depending on your goal, you will start to see results within a few days.\n\nWhere Does the Meditation Part Come in?\n\nIn every guided meditation we do here, you are given a complete mind and body relaxation session. With this deep relaxation session you are guided to relax every part of your body, which will help you brain to reach deep meditative states.\n\nWe've all heard about the many benefits of meditation, so we have incorporated a deep meditative experience into each of our guided mediations.\n\nOur brainwaves, electrical activity in our brains which can be measured, are constantly active, even during sleep. There are 4 basic brain-wave oscillation patterns: Delta, Theta, Alpha, Beta.\n\nDelta waves (0.1-3.9 Hz) are associated with deep and dreamless sleep and the release of human growth hormone. Theta waves (4.0-7.9 Hz) are associated with REM sleep (dreaming), the production of catecholamines (hormones made from tyrosine and released during stress), and increased creativity. Alpha waves (8.0-13.9 Hz) are connected with relaxation, focus, wakefulness and the production of serotonin, a neurotransmitter in the brain and gut that modulates mood, sleep, sexuality, aggression, and anger. Beta waves (14.0-30 Hz) are associated with concentration, arousal, alertness, and cognition but also anxiety, unease, fight and flight.\n\nRelaxing, calm and in control\n\nIn this fast paced world a lot of us spend our time in the beta brainwave stage, and seem to be running at 100 miles per hour, and we're constantly switched on and increasing our stress levels, which is harmful to our bodies and our minds.\n\nMeditation helps you to reach the Alpha and Theta brainwave patterns, which is much more relaxing and can help us deal with day to day life in a much more calm, controlled and focused way. It has also been shown to have benefits for us physically, mentally, emotionally and spiritually.\n\nAt GuidedMind we can use this deep state of focused relaxation to help reach the subconscious mind, and help you to reprogram your mind for success. So you get all the benefits of meditation and also get to reach your life goals with the guided narration in each of our MP3s and CDs.\n\nPay attention! Here comes the science bit\n\nWe're often asked why guided meditation is so effective, so we'd like to give you a little science behind guided meditation, and why it benefits you so much.\n\nIf you think of your mind as being an MP3 player, with hundreds of songs uploaded. All the songs on this MP3 player represent a program that dictates the way you think, act and behave in certain situations. These programs have been installed since your childhood and more added as you've aged.\n\nSo, for example if you were told, as a child that you were no good at maths, a program has been installed in your subconscious mind telling you that you're no good at maths. Years later as an adult, someone asks you how to do a calculation for something, you quickly tell them 'Oh, I don't know I'm no good at maths.' Your brain doesn't even try the calculation as it takes it for granted that you'll never be able to do it as you're no good at maths.\n\n\"the programs have not only been written and stored in the brain, but stored in the very cells of your body\"\n\nThe fascinating part about all of this is that the programs have not only been written and stored in the brain, but stored in the very cells of your body. The brain has literally created a path, a neural network, to coordinate your actions based on environmental factors, which speaks to the cells in your body.\n\nIf you stop to think about the implications of this for a second, you'll realize that our genes do not determine who we are; it's the images we create in our minds of ourselves that determine who we are.\n\nWe have thousands of programs written into our subconscious mind, and each program will determine how we think, act and behave in any given situation. The trouble is, it's extremely difficult to change these programs without some type of way to access the subconscious mind to rewrite the programs, and make a new neural pathway that will communicate effectively with the cells and genes in our body.\n\nGuided meditation has the power to reach your subconscious mind, by feeding it images, sounds, and directing your imagination to experience all your senses, thereby giving your brain an experience of what feels like a real experience. When you have a real experience new neural pathways are made that affect your whole body, so when you listen to a guided meditation from GuidedMind your are literally rewiring your brain to form new neural pathways for your future success", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "dfb36f86-4f9f-4804-bb1c-148931977a3b", "url": "https://www.guidedmind.com/how-it-works"}

It's doable, according to science, but you'll have to give up some things you may love, like fast food and that Netflix bingeing coach potato lifestyle. Sorry.\n\nA new study in the American Heart Association's journal, Circulation, examined the data of more than 100,000 people, who were tracked for up to 34 years. Scientists looked at life expectancy among people who engaged in five \"low-risk lifestyle factors,\" such as not smoking. The researchers found that if you stick to these five healthy habits you could live longer, an average of 14 years longer for women and 12 years for men. It's not the fountain of youth but it's nothing to sneeze at. Particularly since as the study noted, Americans have a shorter life expectancy compared with residents of almost all other high-income countries.\n\nThe rub is that while none of these habits are rocket science to figure out, they sure can be hard to stick to.\n\n#2 Get moving. Exercise 30 minutes or more a day. Moderate exercise counts.\n\n#3 Maintain a healthy weight A body mass index between 18.5 and 24.9 is the target.\n\n#4 Cut back on the sauce No more than one 5 oz. glass of wine per day for women, and two glasses for men\n\n#5 No smoking (ever)\n\n\"This study underscores the importance of following healthy lifestyle habits for improving longevity in the U.S. population,\" Frank Hu, chair of the Department of Nutrition at the Harvard T.H.

Therefore, public policies should put more emphasis on creating healthy food . . . and social environments to support and promote healthy diet and lifestyles.\"\n\nTo boost your resolve to get fit and avoid the temptation to sink back into bad habits, people need active social lives and enough sleep, MarketWatch noted. More than 40% of adults in the U.S. suffer from loneliness, which is linked to depression, dementia, anxiety and cardiovascular diseases.

Utilitarianism: john stuart mill 1) the basic principle of mill's utilitarianism is the greatest happiness principle (pu): an action is right insofar as it maximizes general utility, which mill identifies with happiness. First published in 1861, utilitarianism constituted mill's fullest treatment of the moral theory that was responsible for much of his philosophy following in the footsteps of jeremy bentham, in this work mill provides the capstone paper outlining classical utilitarian ethics. Utilitarianism began with the philosophies of jeremy bentham (1748-1832) and john stuart mill (1806-1873) utilitarianism gets its name from bentham's test question, what is the use of it he conceived of the idea when he ran across the words the greatest happiness of the greatest number in joseph priestly's treatise of government.\n\n1 utilitarianism an introduction to the moral theories of jeremy bentham and john stuart mill 2.

{"text": "For most of us, the use of IT systems is becoming more and more common place and saving business data on a PC or server is a daily occurrence. Having just one copy of business critical information such as accounts, contacts, invoices and important documents poses a risk. How would your business function if this information was not available for just one day? And what long term effects would this have for you?\n\nWHAT IS DATA BACKUP?\n\nData backup is one of the most important areas of IT and yet is also one of the most ignored. Data is essential to the smooth running of any business and is the essential start to any business continuity plan. 'Backing up' means making a copy of your most important files; this can then be used if the original copy is lost. Preferably the second copy should be held at a different location to the original and be kept in a secure environment.\n\nWHY YOU SHOULD BACKUP\n\nData loss can happen in many ways, the most common causes are physical failure of your PC, accidental error, theft or disasters like fire, flood and dropped coffee mugs! It is also common for data to be saved to just one place, like 'My Documents' on your PC's hard drive. Which means that if this data were to be accidentally changed or deleted it would take considerable time and expense to restore it.\n\nGrowing numbers of computer viruses are also a risk to business information, as once they have infected your machine they often delete or corrupt your data. This is another reason why backing up your data is such an important thing to do.\n\nWHAT DATA SHOULD YOU BACKUP?\n\nChoosing what data to back up is a key start to making sure you have a copy of all your business critical information. You should think about what you would need to continue working if your PC were to be stolen/damaged. Clients address/telephone details, your account information, important documents. What about your Internet favourites and email addresses stored on your machine? How long has it taken you to collate all this information and what would happen if you couldn't get it back once lost? These are the key things that you should be thinking about backing up.\n\nWHAT TYPE OF BACKUP SHOULD YOU DO?\n\nThere are various types of backup available and the one you choose will generally depend on time, security and budget. There are a number of frequently used backup solutions which will suit your needs.\n\nMemory stick devices tend to be used for smaller backups or mobile users. These are usually removable hard drives and are very popular. The disadvantages of these cheaper devices are that they are at times unreliable and easy to lose or damage due to their small size. The data which is held on them is usually unsecured, meaning if customer details or financial information is held on them this is a greater risk if they were to be lost or used by unauthorised personnel. When a backup is done the previous backup is overwritten, meaning that only one version of the backup can be stored.\n\nTape backup is an old industry standard backup medium for businesses with a reasonable amount of data to backup. You can perform daily, weekly and monthly backups and as long as you have a reasonable tape rotation and store the tapes offsite it is an easy to use backup solution. The disadvantages of tape are that it is slow, both to backup and to restore. As it is a manual process it can be subject to human error and unless you remember to take the tapes offsite on a daily basis it is subject to the same threats as the original backup.\n\nOnline data backup is a popular choice for small and medium businesses as there is no need to purchase hardware or software, just a small monthly cost. You select the data you want to backup and it is transferred in an encrypted format across the internet to a high security data centre. The backups are fully automated, meaning no user intervention is required and you can restore single files or full backups at the click of a mouse; total protection and availability make this a very attractive option. Different versions of backups are available; this covers accidental changes made or deletions. Disadvantages of using online data backup are that it is dependent on your internet connection so is only suitable for those with broadband or a high speed connection.\n\nOther things to consider when backing up... always test your copied data – a backup is useless if it cannot restore correctly. Backup regularly, you don't want to find out the last copy you made is 4 months old. Keep your backups off site, that way if you do lose data to a fire/flood/theft you know you can retrieve your information.\n\nBUSINESS CONTINUITY\n\nLoss of data could be detrimental to any business so talk to us today, options start from as little as £9 for managed service.", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "c0563539-e96d-4c1f-b175-16e26186c7a8", "url": "https://www.alphatechonline.co.uk/data-backup"}

[ view full abstract ]\n\nUrbanization presents one of the world's greatest threats to biodiversity. Not only is urbanization responsible for habitat modification, but the number of people and goods moving through urbanized areas also increases the chance of nonnative species being introduced. Further complicating the situation is the fact that urbanized areas largely consist of private property (e.g., backyards) that is typically difficult for biologists to access. At the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County, we think that citizen science is the best solution to this challenge.\n\nConsider the Greater Los Angeles Area, which is the second largest metropolitan region in the United States and also sits within the California Floristic Province (CFP), one of the Earth's 35 biodiversity hotspots. This region is home to 18.4 million people, the 6th busiest airport in the world, and the busiest container port in the United States. With so many people, goods, and cargo moving through the region, coupled with southern California's mild Mediterranean climate, there is an extremely high threat of nonnative species becoming established. We created the Reptiles and Amphibians of Southern California (RASCals) citizen science project to understand how species ranges have been impacted by urbanization. This is done by comparing modern citizen science generated records to historical museum records. We also use RASCals data to detect nonnative species and document changes to their ranges. Although open for only 1.5 years, this project has already generated multiple discoveries including several for which citizen scientists and museum researchers co-authored peer-reviewed, scientific publications.", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "ea39dd10-a614-4078-a295-c8d81f800bea", "url": "http://programme.exordo.com/cs2015/delegates/presentation/342/"}

{"text": "Date\n\nWritten By\n\nComments\n\nLet's face it, fat loss is hard and the last thing you need are things getting in your way when you're working your butt off trying to lose fat.\n\nHere are 5 things that could be ruining your efforts and how to combat them.\n\n1. Restricting calories or not eating enough\n\nSometimes to speed up results, we cut the amount of food we eat, thinking that less food equals more fat loss. This is not the case and it can actually make things worse for your body. Instead go for a well balanced, healthy eating and lifestyle plan, stick with this and don't focus on cutting calories. Your body will end up playing catch up and trust me, it doesn't like it.\n\n2.Too much exercising\n\nThis is a bit like restricting food, in the sense that if we don't see results quickly, we want to go harder and do more. You might think that more calories burnt will lead to more fat loss, but it will just push your body into exhaustion. Find a training program that fits into your lifestyle and isn't overly time consuming. You don't have to work out for long periods of time to get results, instead work hard during your workout time.\n\n3.Inconsistency\n\nBelieve it or not, you don't always have to keep your body guessing!! If your training plan covers multi-direction movements, resistance, rehabilitation and function as well as a nutrition plan that covers your energy output needs, you're all good. You can make things progressively harder, challenge yourself but you don't need to chop and change things all the time. Train and eat realistically. You don't need to go to extremes, you want to maintain this for life. Cruise at a rate you can sustain so that you don't crash and burn.\n\n4.Wasting time working out\n\nIf you're at the gym scrolling through social media, taking selfies in the mirror and catching up on the goss on the treadmill then you need to change your workout habits. You won't get anything done and you'll end up spending more time at the gym that you actually need to. Avoid this by getting a good playlist and if you're going to the gym with friends, go with the right ones – the motivated, serious ones. Use a diary and track your results and progress after each workout.\n\n5.Impatience\n\nWe're all the same. We eat a salad, go to the gym once and start looking for abs that night! Our bodies are amazing!!! Look at all they can do, we grew from tiny babies to full grown adults, we can reproduce, we can put on weight, lose weight BUT none of it happens over night. As the saying goes, you don't get fat from eating one bad meal, so you're not going to lose weight after eating one good one.\n\nYou need to learn how your body works and what to expect from the work you're putting in. If you want to lose 5kgs in a week but you \"only\" lose 1kg, you'll be disappointed because you had hoped for more, but it's important that you understand that things works at certain rates, both negatively and positively. Set yourself realistic goals and stick to them. Once you get to know your body and you know how long things \"should\" take, you can start to plan what you need to do and when. But put in the work. Don't do half a job and expect full results.", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "4f1d94e5-2d0c-445d-aa79-8da23b0a7915", "url": "https://www.missfitsupplements.com/blogs/news/5-reasons-you-re-not-losing-fat"}

{"text": "The Benefits of DAILY PRACTICE & REVIEW (And how to implement it in your daily routine.)\n\nWednesday, 5 December 2018\n\nHi Friends,\n\nToday in Second Grade we reviewed and practiced in ELA and MATH. I actually do this EVERYDAY. Daily practice and review is how I get my kiddies to improve in reading and number sense. It's how I ensure that all my students acquire those important base skills that help them with grade level work in ELA and MATH.\n\nI usually try to set aside 30-45 minutes (in ELA) and 15-20 minutes (in MATH) a day for this. It may seem like a lot of time to devote to practice/review, but without basic skills students will have difficulties grasping grade level content. Just like taking time at the beginning of the year to teach behavior expectations and routine will pay off and save time later on, so will practicing and reviewing phonics, sight words, and number sense.\n\nYou might be wondering how I manage to reach all levels during practice/review. There is a lot of differentiated instruction going on during these blocks. Although, I have many students who NEED phonics practice, I also have quite a few who are beyond that and need a different challenge. This is when my attendant or parent volunteers are so important. I make sure to have appropriate activities prepared for all students and usually ask the other adult in the room to sit with a group and guide them. Sometimes, I'm alone so I make sure that the work is easy for the group to complete ON THEIR OWN. I want all students to get what they need during practice/review time.\n\nELA\n\nIn ELA, my main focus during this block is usually reading. Many students are still struggling with phonics, CVC words, sight words, etc... We work on these skills in a specific order and move along as quickly or slowly as we need to. I begin with a short group lesson on the interactive whiteboard and then the students work individually on digital games or printable worksheets. While they work, I pull students aside for quick phonics or sight word checks and even a little guided reading. You wouldn't imagine the great information I get from these blocks and one-on-one time with students.\n\nMy advanced readers complete novel study activities and enriched vocabulary activities. They love the challenge. I also make time to meet with them individually and do some guided reading too (we don't meet for GR as often but I make it a point to read with them as well).\n\nAt least twice a week, I devote some of our practice/review time to journal writing for ALL students. There are no rules. They are expected to write about anything and everything. The other day a student showed me her journal entry for the day and it was simply a list of ways to say hello in different languages. It was so precious. My colleague recently gave me the idea to allow students to ask me questions in their journal. When I look through them I can answer them. I'm very excited to implement this, I think the students will be even more excited about journal writing than they already are! Journal writing, is another great time to meet with kids in small groups or one-on-one.\n\nI also devote 5-10 minutes to songs (not every time but when we can). Singing is such a great way to practice fluency and help students gain confidence in reading (the repeated activity allows them to be able to read the lyrics and feel great about it). I share the lyrics with the students and they even bring them home. I usually print a few songs for each theme and hand them out at the beginning of the month. We sing them all month long and it's so much fun!\n\nMATH\n\nOur math practice/review often happens in the first 10-15 minutes of our regular math block for the day. It almost always includes all students together. I begin by playing a lot of 100 chart games. Learning to understand that each row has ten numbers and that each column is ten more. We learn to count by 10s and 1s. You can check out my blogpost on number sense HERE. We also sing a lot of songs. Even though certain skills like addition and subtraction strategies are only taught in January, we begin right at the beginning of the year. We learn to add doubles, count on, skip count, ect... They get so good and comfortable with it that I begin asking questions like: \"What's 225 + 225?\" and \"What's 300 more than 600?\" or \"What's the skip counting rule for 310, 320, 330?\" They love when they can transfer their learning to BIG NUMBERS!\n\nWe also subtitize! A LOT! This skill is so important and really helps students better understand numbers and just be quicker with math. Once again, all this practice really has great benefits. After a few weeks I can already see improvement and better understanding of math concepts. They just pick up new learning so much quicker and easier with this practice.\n\nSome math blocks are just devoted to practice and review. After a short whole group lesson consisting of some (never all) of the activities mentioned above, I ask students to complete digital math games or printables to practice number sense on their own. Once again, this is a great time for me to meet in small guided math groups and go over anything that students are struggling with during the week.\n\nThese practice/review sessions are not only beneficial to help students improve in ELA and MATH , but also give me lots of opportunities to meet with students. Meeting with students in small groups and one-on-one is SO important. I know it can be hard (trust me I've had years where it was near impossible) but we must find the opportunities to do so even if it's just for a few minutes. The information we get from meeting with students is GOLD. You can then use it to guide your teaching and make sure you are reaching every student and meeting all of their needs.", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "7091ac68-625d-4aa2-bdb0-a82d8d90318d", "url": "http://todayinsecondgrade.blogspot.com/2018/12/the-benefits-of-daily-practice-review.html"}

{"text": "Fun and Learning Multiply in Lido's Math Museum\n\nStudents in grades K-5 at Lido School are exploring mathematics in a new light, through the recent installation of a Math Museum that encompasses various aspects of the subject. Unveiled with a ribbon cutting on March 3, the museum was met with enthusiasm from both students and staff members.\n\nSpearheaded by teachers and Principal Brenda Young, the museum's launch was timed in conjunction with the month of March for a celebration dubbed March Math Madness. Located at Math Midway, an area of the building's main hallway, the museum is comprised of many features.\n\nAn estimation station allows students to make number predictions, and various activities, games and reading materials provide fun and interactive ways for students of all ages to enhance their math skills either independently or together. A geometric figure named Melinda Math poses a problem for students to solve, and a measuring center encourages them to determine their heights.\nThroughout the month of March, Lido is embracing a special focus on mathematics. Students can solve the Math Mystery Number questions that are displayed on posters outside of each classroom, and Morning Math Moments are shared daily during announcements to enrich students' mathematics vocabularies. Mathematical symbols can be spotted throughout the building, and students are asked to participate in Math Matters word problems each week with answers placed on a Math Masters Mural.\n\n\"The museum was introduced as a way to focus on math and show a love and appreciation for math,\" said Mrs. Young.\n\n\"People are often afraid of math, and this shows that it is fun,\" said district math coach Theresa Taplin.\n\nEach class will visit the museum, and it is also open to the public during the following hours of operation: Wednesday, March 16 from 6-9 p.m., Thursday, March 17 from 1:15-3:15 p.m. and Friday, March 18 from 1:15-3:15 p.m.", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "c59b50b6-489c-44da-9f6e-bec1c194a94d", "url": "http://www.lbeach.org/News/Story.aspx?id=67117"}
{"text": "Motor Types\n\nBoth AC and DC motors, as well as single and three phase motors, can use a motor soft start.\n\nSizing a Motor Soft Start\n\nA motor's power requirements are measured in current, voltage, kilowatts and horsepower. The bigger the motor the larger the soft starter that will be required.\n\nProtecting a Motor Soft Start From Environmental Conditions\n\nThe number of starts and the environmental conditions also have to be taken into account when selecting a soft starter. Environmental conditions, such as ambient temperature, humidity, and altitude, can shorten the life of the starter.\n\nFor example, if the soft starter is being used in a hot environment, then the soft start needs to be derated to allow for proper operation. In some cases, corrosive gases and acids may exist that can also damage the motor and starter.\n\nTo give the motor extra defense from external conditions, circuit boards should be given an extra protective coating.\n\nHow Often Can I Turn On The Motor Soft Start?\n\nThe number of starts per hour that a soft starter is limited to is dependent upon the following:\n\nAmbient temperature\n\nHumidity\n\nAltitude\n\nStarting current\n\nDuration of startup\n\nThe soft starter being used will also be a factor, with the starts per hour varying by model.\n\nCan a motor soft starter be used to adjust motor starting duration and current?\n\nStart ramp is how long it will take for a soft starter to reach full voltage. This parameter can be controlled with a soft starter. If the ramp time is too long, it can result in the overheating of the motor and increase the risk of the overload relay tripping.\n\nThe duration of the start time for the motor will depend on the size of the load the motor is carrying: if the motor is unloaded, the ramp time will be shorter, but if the motor is heavily loaded, the ramp time will become longer.\n\nSome starters have a control function through which current draw is limited to a set value during voltage ramp up or ramp down period. Stop ramps may also be programmed into the starter. They are used when soft stopping is required.\n\nMotor Soft Start Programming\n\nA solid state starter will be digital, which means it can be programmed to reach a certain voltage in a set amount of time or limit current to a set value during startup. These starters will contain a number of communications features for interacting with other devices to suit your needs.", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "4babbc09-f4e3-4a08-90c2-b67970d1431b", "url": "http://www.soft-starter.co/motor_soft_start_selection.html"}
{"text": "So you are like many vape enthusiasts and have found yourself in a sticky situation trying to clean up e-liquid that has either gotten on your box mod (yes, some tend to overfill) or you've spilled vape juice on a counter, car seat, desk or other surface that needs to be cleaned. Welcome to the club!\n\nFirst and foremost, paper towels are your friend and disposable gloves (latex, etc.) are a cheap and valuable investment. Pop on some gloves and wipe the surface down with paper towels to remove any excess liquid.\n\nAfter excess e-liquid has been wiped clean, depending on the surface material, proceed with a fresh paper towel that's slightly damp. Many times water is all that's needed. If not, on to the next step.\n\nIf a damp paper towel wasn't enough to get the job done, you'll need to use some sort of cleaner to remove sticky vape juice residue and the cleaner you use must be appropriate for the surface you're cleaning. Don't go dousing your car seats with bleach or other harsh chemicals, and go for the least abrasive solution first. Isopropyl alcohol and popular gum/tar removers work well.\n\nLastly, if you want to avoid e-juice catastrophes altogether, consider moving towards a pod mod system that uses replaceable pods instead of tanks that need to be refilled.

{"text": "So you've already got a key called something-flat (Bb major) with two flats, whereas it takes six sharps to get one called something-sharp (F# major). The common range of whistles cited by Phill simply covers the most common keys, so his Bb scale of keys is just coincidence.\n\nInterestingly, it's the opposite way round for minor keys; the first on the sharp side to be called something-sharp is F# minor at three sharps, whereas the first on the flat side to be something-flat is Bb minor at five flats. But we don't make or name whistles for minor-key bell notes!\n\nOK, thanks. That explains why that series of notes is called Bb major. And on the face of it answers my question, but (and there is always one...) why is that particular series of notes used as the keys for the common whistles? Or to put it the other way round, why were those keys chosen for the common whistles? There are seven common keys for whistles - following a pattern for an octave, I guess. But why that particular seven notes? why did the whistle bell notes not make A major or C major or D major, or F# major? I am sure that there is a rational (maybe even a logical) answer - it may even be blindingly obvious to everyone but me\n\nThe major key with no sharps or flats is C. G has one sharp and F has one flat. D has two sharps and Bb has two flats. A has three sharps and Eb has three flats. These keys were chosen for the most common whistles because they're the most common keys; you're far more likely to want to play in C or D than F# or Db. So nothing I've said explains why that series of notes is called Bb major, but everything I've said attempts to explain why these are the common whistle keysDoes that mean that from the standard starting point Bb is seven steps around the circle of fifths? That would be the kind of inevitability that would explain Bb turning up here. Given a certain starting point (I am assuming C here) and a desire to use all variants of 1..3 sharps and flats, the end point can only be Bb.

{"text": "Students, get involved and fight police injustice\n\nPosted:\n\nApril 9, 1995\n\n9:00 pm\n\nI enjoyed The Bruin's articles pertaining to the recent Westwood\n\"riots.\" Perhaps this example of police brutality will serve as a\ncatalyst for UCLA students to become activists.\n\nUCLA students, do not let this experience be forgotten. Do not\nlet it fail to motivate you. The Los Angeles Police Department and\nthe University of California Police Department are simply gangs of\nrogue cowards. They use excessive force under \"color of authority,\"\nwhich is simply a politically correct way of saying coward.\n\nLong before Gates and the '92 rebellion, the Parker\nadministration was investigated and found to be corrupt just as the\nGates administration had been, and nothing happened, then as now.\nEvery day there are articles in the newspapers documenting\ncorruption and brutality by police thugs. Currently, lawsuits are\npending against the LAPD and UCPD (by both students and\nex-cops).\n\nA well-read person realizes that these reported incidents are\njust the tip of the iceberg. I am surprised that after the Rodney\nKing incident, no civilians with video cameras filming Monday night\nin Westwood have come forward yet. If they were filming, I hope The\nBruin asks those people to come forward to enable prosecution of\nthe police thugs.\n\nLos Angeles settles claims for millions of dollars per year\npertaining to police brutality ­ still, there is little to no\nprotest from citizens. The police play a game and walk a tightrope,\nkissing ass to the wealthy and powerful and abusing the\nvulnerable.\n\nWhy wasn't the judge who gave O.J. Simpson a slap on the wrist\non the wife beating conviction charged with malfeasance? Why\nweren't the cops suspected of doing favors for Simpson, who was\nknown to beat his wife, similarly charged? After Simpson was\narrested for wife beating, why didn't the police watch him in order\nto protect Nicole?\n\nI say that the judge and the cops are culpable and should be\nprosecuted.\n\nI am a homeless Vietnam vet, college-educated, well-read and\nwell-traveled. The cops ­ from the West L.A. department as\nwell as from the UCPD ­ constantly harass me, follow me and\ntry to entrap me. In my opinion, the police recently broke into a\nfriends' locked locker that I have permission to use and took many\nof my valuable possessions.\n\nAnd at the same time, they kiss ass to the rich and powerful,\nmany of whom have been suspected of criminal activity ­ O.J.\nSimpson, Michael Milken, even radiology guys from UCLA who were\nrecently charged with stealing more than $600,000 from UCLA.\n\nWith the current crime rate and increased tension in L.A., the\npolice are in a good bargaining position now and they can use this\nto obtain what they want.\n\nFor example, police officers demanded 12-hour shifts, in direct\nconflict to their claim of too much on-the-job stress. If the\neight-hour shift was too difficult and stressful, then how can they\nperform competently for 12 hours?\n\nIf the job is so difficult and stressful then why perform in\nthree consecutive 12-hour shifts ­ would not a day off in\nbetween 12-hour shifts allow for more competent police officers?\nThe police want 3-12s so that they can moonlight and live far from\ntheir work area (in Simi Valley, perhaps). If the job is so\nstressful, why do police policies allow officers to moonlight?\n\nI think citizens deserve well-rested police officers who live in\nor near the areas in which they work. Perhaps if police officers\nwere well-rested local residents they would not attempt to\nseriously injure or kill criminal suspects, but instead, shoot to\nwound or disarm the perpetrator.\n\nBeing a Vietnam Vet, I know that in many of the cases I read\nabout the police using excessive force, any Seal, Recon or special\nforces-trained personnel could disarm without serious injury. Many\ntimes, the victims receive large settlements from the taxpayers.\nWhy are not the police officers trained in these non-lethal\ntechniques?\n\nI hope the above inspires some students to become activists, get\ninvolved and fight for justice.\n\nNo justice, no peace.\n\nSchulte is an activist with the Network for Public Education and\nSocial Justice", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "d4a39e23-8eb0-482c-a327-e5d7d95a5a91", "url": "http://dailybruin.com/1995/04/09/students-get-involved-and-figh/"}
{"text": "A teacher I know estimated that her school lost three weeks of instructional time--or nine percent of the school year--to testing, with no gains in student success. Her frustrated colleagues now say, \"no child left un-tested,\" not \"no child left behind.\"\n\nBecause of the emphasis on testing, some students are so stressed that they don't want to go to school. And, testing imposes a financial burden on school systems. Testing is a time-sink for administrators who spend weeks learning how to administer tests and prevent cheating. Moreover, testing only shows whether or not a student can read or calculate at grade level. It does not indicate why some students fall short or what teachers could do about the shortfall. To improve student outcomes, schools should be spending as much effort helping teachers find ways to improve outcomes as they do on testing, asserts Simon Rodberg in the Harvard Business Review.\n\nData Collection Is Just the Beginning\n\nBesides schools, businesses, healthcare institutions, and government agencies collect data--the more the better. Unfortunately, many organizations lose sight of their original objectives--identifying problems and finding solutions to problems, such as customer attrition, lack of growth, or growing staff disaffection. Organizations spend so much time setting up processes, collecting data, and analyzing results that no time or money remains for taking corrective actions.\n\nFor years school systems believed that testing would lead to student success. Rodberg's HBR article recommends that schools not stop with testing but that they work with teachers to improve educational outcomes. For other organizations this means collecting the right data, analyzing it, looking for root causes of problems, developing solutions (strategies), and then forming action plans (tactics) for implementing solutions.\n\nGathering and using data requires a thoughtful approach. In businesses this means deciding what data to collect and why and then following data collection with a comprehensive examination of methods for analyzing the results and identifying the causes of problems. Then comes a search for potential solutions and the development of action plans. Both managers and staff may need additional training to do this. As is true in education, businesses must not only fund data collection but also support corrective actions that lead to real change.", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "7630b7b1-2f2b-49ef-a56b-e737fc46ede3", "url": "https://www.winettassociates.com/newsletters/educations-failure-with-data-collection.html"}

{"text": "How to Add Hooks\n\nContents\n\nOverview\n\nHooks provide an easy mechanism to extend functionality from external module. It basically consists on a lightweight mechanism that allows to inject dependencies from third party modules.\n\nThere are two roles for hooks:\n\nBase module that provides the standard functionality and defines some point in its flow that can be extended by external modules\n\nExternal modules that provide extra functionality to the base one. Logic for this extra functionality is executed in the point the base module defines for this purpose.\n\nNote from Retail version 2014Q3 the recommended API has changed, instead of OB.MobileApp.model.hookManager use OB.UTIL.HookManager to access the hook manager\n\nHow to define the hook in the base module\n\nBase module needs to define which are the points other modules can extend through hooks. This is done with the following code:\n\nOB.UTIL.HookManager.executeHooks(hookName, args, callback);\n\nWhen this code is reached, all the hooks defined by external modules for this hookName will be sequentially executed. Finally the callback function will be invoked.\n\nIn case there are no external modules providing functionality for this hook, callback function will be directly executed.\n\nThe 3 parameters this method accept are:\n\nhookName: it is a string that identifies the hook. It will be used by external modules to identify the hook they provide logic for. It is recommended this string to start with the base module's DB prefix in order to avoid possible clashes between different base modules providing different hooks.\n\nargs: any object the hooks will receive as parameter, this object is defined by the base module and should be considered as part of the API provided to external modules to implement the hook.\n\ncallback: function to be executed after finishing with all hooks execution.\n\nHow to provide logic in external modules\n\nWhen there is a base module that defines a hook as mentioned in the previous section, external modules can provide logic to be executed at that point in the following manner:\n\nOB.UTIL.HookManager.registerHook('BASMOD_HookName', function(args, callbacks){// execute all your logic here// This is a MUST to properly manage callbacks\nOB.UTIL.HookManager.callbackExecutor(args, callbacks);\n});\n\nregisterHook function receives 2 parameters:\n\nHook name: which is the name that the base module defined for the hook.\n\nFunction to be executed, which is the logic the hook implements. In order to properly manage the chain of other implementations for this same hook and to finally invoke the callback function the base module defines, callbackExecutor method needs to be invoked when the hook logic is done.\n\nExample\n\nThis example shows how is code for hooks in both sides, base and external module.", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "7c615a4c-b795-4712-b840-940638b5e1ab", "url": "http://wiki.openbravo.com/wiki/How_to_Add_Hooks"}

(Of course, many other countries also have similar traditions.)\n\n'Gōri/kōri' (氷) means \"ice,\" but there are several theories about the etymology of 'kaki' (かき).\n\nOne theory says that it comes from the fact that we used 'kaketa kōri' (欠けた氷 - literally means \"chipped ice\") to make 'kakigōri'.\n\nピポ\n\"鬱\" does mean all of the things listed above. Both of the words listed for the first sense also can be used for the meaning in the second sense. \"鬱乎 (ukko)\" would be a word which takes the first sense, but I presume it could probably take the second, but it's not explicitly listed in the copy of the Sanseido Daijirin that I'm using. \"鬱勃\" does refer to things that are active, but more so in the sense that it is popular. There is another sense that \"鬱\" can refer to that Toru didn't mention and that would be to stagnate as in \"鬱血 (ukketu)\" which refers to vascular congestion (i.e. when a blood vessel becomes congested). I feel this is intrinsically related to the first sence, but it is nice to see it stated somewhere. Whether or not \"鬱\" is mostly used in compounds nowadays to refer to being depressed doesn't change the fact that if it used by itself than it'll \"mean 'gloomy feeling' or '(clinical) depression.'\"\n\n\"鑑\" can be read as \"kagami.\" It's just not in the list of characters for regular use. It is from the same root as \"鏡.\" It's just a different glyph for a different sense. The main sense in this case matches what Toru says, but it can also means (badly translated into English) written material that collects materials/data/documents. This describes 図鑑 which is a written material that systematically collects stuff centered around images and diagrams/chart (図). Thus 図鑑 (illustrated reference book) is an illustration-model.\n\nI didn't mean to ramble that much, but don't worry because I also enjoy writing the character \"鬱,\" but a lot of people don't and prefer to just write \"うつ.\"\n\nToru\nThank you so much for the corrections and comments! And thank you for the explanations, ピポ-san! :)\n\n> I'm not sure about the \"things are active\" meaning. I can't find any words matching that description, unless you are referring to 鬱勃?\n\nAs you said, there are few words containing 鬱 that mean \"things are active.\" 鬱勃 might be the only word which matches the above description.

[It is usually used with a certain emotion, which is marked with で, for example 喜びで~ \"to have one's heart filled with joy\"]\n\nI've just added the extra sentence based on what I learned in your previous post.

No correction needed!This is my first time seeing 感慨無量. I never knew that 感無量 was an abbreviation of it.\n\nThe two parts are combined in a logical way, so you can use \"so\" to highlight/emphasise that.\n\nThat is to say, the literal meaning of 'kan-muryō' and 'kangai muryō' is one's innumerable deep emotion.decAlso \"immeasurably deep emotion\", which is probably better than \"unfathomably\" because that has an extra sense of mystery:\n\n\"immeasurably superior\" (so superior that we almost can't measure the difference) \"unfathomably superior\" (so superior that we can't even begin to understand the difference)\n\nToru\nThank you so much for the helpful correction again!

It's more natural in English for something to do something else (instead of it just happening)\n\nSo, \"my university held\" is more natural.\n\nHowever, you can also say \"Yesterday, there was a party held at my university for ...\" because the doer (行為者) is unimportant. (this is closer to what you wrote).\n\n2. Putting \"at my university\" or \"was held\" at the end of the sentence sounds strange here.\n\nThe three main bits of information you want to express are:\n\na) There was a party; b) It was held at the university; and c) The purpose of the party\n\n(also (d) the time, \"Yesterday\")\n\nIt's more natural to combine (a) and (b) into one part and make (c) another part. The natural sentence structure for this is (a+b) (c). Your sentence structure starts off with a bit of (a), then goes (c) (a+b).\n\nThe (a+b) (c) sentence structure also works well with your following sentence because that sentence refers back to (c), which is at the end of this sentence. The distance between mentioning (c) and referring back to it is shorter, so it's easier to understand.\n\nSince I was also one of the teachers who leave the university, my boss paid me a heartfelt compliment, then I was filled with joy.\n\nSince I was also one of the teachers leaving the university, my boss paid me a heartfelt compliment, andit filled me with joy.\n\nThe \"which\" correction is good too.\n\nWhen you are filled with emotions such as joy or grief, you can describe it as 'mune ga ippai ni naru' (胸がいっぱいになる).\n\n\"overflowed\" sounds weird in English in this case. Does 溢れる also sound strange in Japanese?\n\nToru\nThank you so much for the correction and helpful comments! :)\n\n> \"overflowed\" sounds weird in English in this case. Does 溢れる also sound strange in Japanese? I think that using 溢れる to emotions does not sound strange in Japanese. For example, we say 悲しみが溢れる or 喜びで満ち溢れる.\n\ndec\n有難う、Toruさん。色々勉強になりました。\n\ndec\nSpeaking of being \"full\" or \"overflowing\", you might also like another English expression... \"brimming with\", eg \"brimming with excitement/enthusiasm/confidence/etc\". You can also use it for physical things: \"the basket was brimming with tasty treats\", \"his eyes were brimming with tears\". The brim of a container is the top part, so if something is \"brimming\", it's on the boundary between full and overflowing. (also \"full to the brim\")\n\ndec\nAlso, now that I come to think of it, \"overjoyed\" also has a sense of 溢れる…\n\nToru\nWow, thank you for the informative comments!

Finger also gets quotation marks just like \"index finger\" in this sentence.\n\nThis phrase comes from the fact that children suck their index finger when they can't get what they want.\n\nToru\nThank you so much for the correction! そうですね、「切り札」や「伝家の宝刀」は、よくピンチに時に使います。 言葉の由来について調べると、面白い発見がたくさんあります。:)\n\nDenka no Houtou (伝家の宝刀 - A Last Resort)\n\nFeb 24, 2019 23:27\n\nDenka no Houtou\n\nA measure of last resort that you use in an emergency is referred to as 'denka no houtou' (伝家の宝刀) in Japanese.Since such a sword of the heirloom is a strong weapon used in an emergency, this term came to have its current meaning.\n\n伝家の宝刀\n\nいざというときに出す、とっておきの切り札のことを、「伝家の宝刀」と言います。\n\n「伝」は \"tradition\"、「家」は \"family/house\" を意味し、「伝家」で先祖代々その家に伝わることを意味します。\n\nまた、「宝」は \"treasure\"、「刀」は \"sword\" を意味するので、「伝家の宝刀」の文字通りの意味は \"a treasured sword that has been passed down in someone's family for generations\" となります。\n\n家宝として代々伝えられてきた刀はいざというときに使う強力な武器であることから、「伝家の宝刀」は現在の意味を持つようになったというわけです。\n\nNo. 1 AylesC's correction\n\nDenka no Houtou\n\nThis sentence is perfect!

I would guess that \"right consideration\" is a decent short translation when describing applying that to real situations. When describing what that means, I would guess it's something like \"openness to perceiving the real situation\" (instead of being deluded by preconceptions).\n\nIn addition, 'ba' (場) means \"field\" or \"situation.\"\n\nIn addition, 'ba' (場) means \"field\" or \"situation.\"\n\nI suppose that this 場 is probably very close in meaning to 場面 or 場合\n\nThat is to say, 'shōnenba' represents a very important situation that requires the right heart or the truth.\n\nThat is to say, 'shōnenba' represents a very important situation that requires the right heart or the truth.\n\nI would say that \"heart\" here is not something proactive (積極的、like 大胆) but \"accepting\" (being *com*passionate or \"listening to your heart\"; so this \"heart\" is more \"inward\" than \"outward\") and \"the truth\" is not some philosophical or objective truth, but \"the way things actually are\" (Sanskrit: tathātā).\n\nAfter all that complicated analysis, it's possible to translate this simply into English as being \"a/the moment of truth\"\n\nAt first I was surprised by your using 選挙 and 迎える because I thought that people/animals were the only ones that did 迎える.

Indeed, I should have added a sentence something like \"..., whereas 'hara ga futoi' usually means to have a big heart.\"\n\nHara ga Futoi (腹が太い - One's Heart is Large)\n\nJan 10, 2019 23:04\n\nHara ga Futoi\n\nThere is an idiom, 'hara ga futoi' (腹が太い) in Japanese.\n\n'Hara' (腹) usually means \"stomach\" or \"belly,\" but here it implies \"heart\" or \"capacity.\"\n\nIn addition, 'futoi' (太い) means \"large,\" \"thick,\" or \"wide.\"\n\nThat is to say, 'hara ga futoi' is a compliment that means \"one's heart/capacity is large.\"\n\nHowever, it could literally mean that one's belly is big, so please be careful when you use this idiom.\n\nIncidentally, in several areas of western Japan, 'hara ga futoi' is used to mean to have a full stomach.\n\n腹が太い\n\n日本語には「腹が太い」という慣用句があります。\n\n「腹」は通常 \"stomach\" や \"belly\" を意味しますが、ここでは「度量」や「胆力」のことを表しています。\n\nまた、「太い」は \"large\" や \"thick\"、\"wide\" を意味します。\n\nすなわち「腹が太い」とは、「度量が大きい」ということを意味する誉め言葉です。\n\nしかし、場合によっては文字どおり太っていることを意味する可能性もあるので、使い方には注意して下さい。\n\nちなみに、西日本の一部の地域では、「腹が太い」は「満腹」の意味でも用いられます。\n\nNo. 1 daChewyDuck17881's correction\n\nHara ga Futoi\n\nThis sentence is perfect!

However, I suggest using \"That being said,...\" because it more clearly implies what you said before is added to your following statement! \"That is to say\" is more used when clarifying and rewording something that seems to be confusing.\n\nHowever, it could literally mean that one's belly is big, so please be careful when you use this idiom.\n\nHowever, it could also literally mean that one's belly is big, so please be careful when you use this idiom.\n\nThe \"also\" is optional! As for the second blue part, in Japanese this phrase would sound quite natural and in spoken English it sounds natural. However, in formal written English it is more common to use indirect language rather \"you.\" Try perhaps \"It is advisable to be careful...\"!\n\nIncidentally, in several areas of western Japan, 'hara ga futoi' is used to mean to have a full stomach.\n\nCoincidentally, in several areas of western Japan, 'hara ga futoi' is used to mean to have a full stomach.\n\nThe difference between coincidentally and incidentally is subtle, to the point where native English speakers can barely tell the difference (I can't either, in fact)! So don't worry which you use; either way, you'll be perfectly understood.\n\nOverall, a very well written English text without any grammar mistakes! I rather suggest that you practice native English writing patterns and do you best to not just translate from Japanese to English (but there is no shame in that!). Keep up the great work!

The verb \"to be borne [of|from]\" is more like 生じた。You can think of it like a non-physical version of \"to be born\".\n\nSome people use this idiom in a positive sense, but it is usually used in a negative sense because it contains a nuance that you act without thinking consequences or surroundings.\n\nSome people use this idiom in a positive sense, but it is usually used in a negative way because it contains a nuance that you act without thinking of the consequences or the surroundings.\n\nIn English, we say \"to behave like a bull in a china shop\" (where \"china\" = 瀬戸物). It's always used in a negative way.\n\nI changed the second \"sense\" to \"way\" because it sounds better when you don't repeat the exact same word. \"Way\" sounds more general than \"sense\", so the feeling of the sentences is that first you explain precisely what you mean (using the word \"sense\") and then use a more vague/imprecise word for the same thing the second time. I suppose that in a way, it shows that you trust that the reader understood the more precise word the first time, so you don't need to repeat it.\n\nToru\nThank you so much for the corrections and helpful comments! I learned something new. :)\n\nNo. 2 Kiwi's correction\n\nThe English slang equivalent is to bumrush. Sometimes you need to bumrush when there's nothing to think about, like when you're in a hostage situation and you see a door, you bumrush toward it.

Yes, since microwaves in Japan emitted the sound チン (which is something like \"ring\" in English) when heating/warming was completed, we call heating up something in a microwave チンする.

I have a question about \"危機一髪\" now! Can you use it only in the context of shaving? Or can you use it as a metaphor, too? For example, if you are in a hurry to get on the train, can you say 危機一髪で乗れた? Or is this only for when having a shave? Fantastic writing! I especially like this part \"the distance is as long as one hair.\"\n\nToru\nThank you so much for the correction! I'm glad to hear you say that. :)\n\n> can you say 危機一髪で乗れた? This sentence is a little unnatural. I think 危機一髪 is only used for when having a close shave/escape. Instead, 間一髪 can be used in several situations. Since 間 (kan) means a gap, 間一髪 literally means a hairbreadth gap. 間一髪で乗れた is a natural sentence.\n\nbill marie\nThank you so much for teaching me a new Japanese saying?\n\nKikokushijo (帰国子女 - Returnee Children)\n\nDec 27, 2018 22:41\n\nKikokushijo\n\nA child who returned to his/her home country after living another country (at least one year) is called 'kikokushijo' (帰国子女) in Japanese.\n\n'Taichō ga warui' can only be used for people, whereas 'guai ga warui' can be used for both people and things.\n\nThis sentence is perfect!

They are all ways to express that two ideas are related but not necessarily contradictory. In fact, I'd say they make them feel a bit complementary, like each part ('dobe' is used in western Japan *and* 'biri' is used in eastern Japan) helps to contribute to a bigger whole (to describe completely how these two words would be used throughout Japan). Hopefully that makes sense!\n\nBoth dobe and biri are slang terms that have the same meaning, \"bottom\" or \"last place.\"\n\nBoth 'dobe' and 'biri' are slang terms that have the same meaning: \"bottom\" or \"last place.\"\n\nI'd probably never use \"bottom\" to mean \"last place\", but if you just mean that the terms can mean \"bottom\" in a different context, then it's no problem.\n\nHowever, \"last place\" can be abbreviated to just \"last\":\n\n\"Aw man, I'm in last place!\" <-> \"Aw man, I'm in last!\"\n\nThe etymologies about these terms have not been clarified, but some people believe that biri comes from 'shiri' (尻), which means \"hip.\"\n\nThe etymologies of these (two) terms have not / haven't been clarified / verified, but some people believe that 'biri' comes from 'shiri' (尻), which means \"hip.\"\n\n\"clarify\" -> to explain something more clearly. \"verify\" -> shown to be true/irrefutable\n\nIn support of this theory, there is the fact that biri can imply \"prostitute.\"\n\nIn support of this theory(, there) is the fact that 'biri' can imply / mean \"prostitute.\"\n\nThis is fine. with \", there\" it sounds pretty awkward, but without it's pretty good. Another option:\n\n(1) That fact that 'biri' [can mean / can be interpreted as] 'prostitute' could possibly support this theory.\n\n(: Let me know if you have any questions.\n\nToru\nThank you so much for the corrections! :)\n\n> I'd probably never use \"bottom\" to mean \"last place\", but if you just mean that the terms can mean \"bottom\" in a different context, then it's no problem.\n\nI used \"bottom\" as the similar sense of \"last place\" (e.g., \"rank at the bottom\" or \"be placed in the bottom\"). I think that it is also similar to \"worst ranking,\" but it my thought wrong?\n\nXishem\nI'd say \"place\" and \"rank\" are different. You can't use \"rank\" to describe a position in a race, for example, only \"place\".\n\nRanks are usually a way to separate people based on their merit in some way (which admittedly is what \"places\" in a race are doing too, but \"rank\" just doesn't work there), and sometimes this includes placing people into groups of rank rather than giving them individual ranks.\n\nThe most common example would be ranks in the military: lieutenant, captain, corporal, general, and so on; these are \"ranks\" in the sense that they place people relative to one another based on their merit, but there's more than person per rank.\n\nYou could never use \"worst ranking\" or \"rank at the bottom\" to describe someone's place in a race. \"be placed in the bottom\" would be fine if a bit unnatural, but it would probably just mean you're in one of the last few places (if there are 16 racers, 13th-16th maybe) rather than absolute last.\n\n---\n\n\"I'm (in) last place.\" \"I'm (in) last.\" \"I'm dead last.\"\n\nThese are really the only ways that I can think of that I would say it. There may be others, but I can't think of any.\n\n---\n\nI just thought of something regarding rank. Rank is usually a more long-term idea.

It's something that you openly say you dislike but you enjoy it while no one is present.\n\nToru\nThank you so much for the corrections. :) And thank you for letting me know the interesting phrase! Indeed I think its nuance is similar to the one of urayamakeshikaran.\n\nNo. 2 Kyle's correction\n\nUrayamakeshikaran (うらやまけしからん)\n\nThis sentence is perfect! No correction needed!\n\nUrayamakeshikaran\n\nThis sentence is perfect! No correction needed! while you should against for that feel repulsed, but you have a longing for the situation in your heart.\n\n\"against for that\" is an island of mistakes in a sea of otherwise flawless English. I am not 100% sure what you meant even when I (try to) read the Japanese, but I think you mean that you want the situation despite the fact that you do not want it. Like you want and do not want at the same time. Or maybe you know that you should not want it, but you do anyway.\n\nOne construction we might use is \"Despite X, Y\" meaning \"X is true, and Y and X usually do not go together, but this time they do.\" \"Despite being an athlete, his legs are not muscular.\" That kind of thing.\n\nI made my suggestion above a little more \"spicy\": \"feel repulsed\" is how you feel when you strongly dislike something.\n\nUrayamakeshikaran is mainly used when seeing sexual situations or cute animals.\n\nThis sentence is perfect! No correction needed!\n\nToru\nThank you so much for the corrections and suggestion. :) I didn't know the term \"feel repulsed,\" but it is probably closer to what I wanted to say.\n\nUrayamashī (うらやましい - Envious)\n\nAug 21, 2018 21:39\n\nUrayamashī\n\nWhen you think that someone is favored/rich and you want to become such a person, you can say 'urayamashī' (うらやましい) to express the feeling.", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "1be6f106-16f8-4b61-ade4-c6d7bd2307cd", "url": "https://kano.ac/all.html"}

{"text": "June 30, 2016\n\nNutritional Yeast for Health\n\nArticles by Dr. Erdman are for informational purposes, and are not to be taken as specific medical advice.\n\nWhile searching for a topic for this week's article, I came\nacross a topic I'd never thought of before. Most of us have heard of active\nyeast used to make bread or beer, but have you ever heard of nutritional yeast\nand Brewer's yeast?\n\nNutritional yeast, known as nooch, is popular with\nvegetarians and vegans as a source of non-animal protein. It contains all nine\nessential amino acids usually found in a meat diet. It is a great source of B\nvitamins, including added B12, which again is mainly found in meat.\n\nThis food is neither plant or animal…it is a fungus, like\nmushrooms. The yeast used for baking and brewing is the same type of yeast\n(saccharomyces cerevisiae) as nutritional yeast, with one big difference.\nBaking/brewing yeast is alive or active. Consuming active yeast can actually\nlead to an overgrowth of yeast in your body or to an infection. Nutritional\nyeast does not have these effects.\n\nThe supplemental nutritional yeast, in a dried flaky form,\nis inactive. You wouldn't use it to bake bread.\n\nNutritional yeast is\ntypically grown on sugar beets, sugar beet molasses, or sugar cane molasses.\nWhen grown on these media, it is called \"primary yeast\", or grown specifically\nfor nutritional yeast.\n\nBrewer's yeast can mean it is a live yeast for brewing,\nspent brewing yeast, or primary grown yeast. This is where knowing the origin\nof the product you are buying is an essential.\n\nNutritional yeast is good for you because it contains B\nvitamins, amino acids, at least 14 minerals and 17 vitamins, phosphorus,\nchromium, and more. It does not naturally contain B12, but it is usually added.\n\nSome conditions which nutritional yeast may be useful for\ninclude: Candida infection, chronic acne, loss of appetite, diarrhea, and\nimmune system stimulation.\n\nRunners and athletes who took one teaspoon daily cut their\ninfection rate in half over placebo takers.\n\nThey say it has a taste similar to parmesan cheese, although\nit looks like yellow fish food in small granules. It can be sprinkled on\nsalads, put into smoothies, or added to soups and stews.\n\nAccording to Dr. Mercola, it is difficult to buy quality\nyeast. You need to know what it is grown on, specifically not on genetically\nengineered beets or cane. You should know what types of vitamins are added,\nnatural or synthetic? And you need to ascertain if it is lead tested. It's not\nthat it is high in lead, but some tests on brands were done, and 3 of 8 showed\nsome lead levels. You could eat 6-7 tablespoons a day and still be under the\ndaily allowable amount. But no lead would be better than miniscule lead at any\nrate.\n\nNutritional yeast sounds like an interesting dietary\nsupplement that can easily be added to your diet. Taking just three quarters of\na teaspoon per day can give you the mentioned benefits, especially for the\nvegetarians and vegans.", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "d97cdf6f-17af-41ca-bb3c-85406e3ff02d", "url": "http://trychiropracticfirst.blogspot.com/2016/06/nutritional-yeast-for-health.html"}

{"text": "Vertical Farming for the home\n\nOver the last few posts, we've been exploring the grandiose idea that is the future of vertical farming – skyscraper hubs of efficient, renewable food production – but big ideas often start small and vertical farming is no different.\n\nUrban Farming\n\nUrban farming is an umbrella term for the practice of cultivating, processing a distributing food in or around urban environments. This encompasses a range of practices including horticulture, animal husbandry and beekeeping. If you or someone you know has a vegetable garden or fruit trees in their backyard, then this is an example of urban farming.\n\nThe world in its current state struggles to feed all of the people that currently inhabit it, and one of the solutions that has been thought up is that if more people grow their own food, fewer people will go hungry. This is not to say that people should grow the entirety of their food, but every meal they can produce themselves is a meal that hasn't had to come from elsewhere.\n\nNow if you are a person or persons that are fortunate enough to inhabit a piece of land, then relatively speaking, it's easy enough to set up a garden and start growing food. However, for people who live in apartments or the like, this becomes an altogether more challenging task. Yet this is again where vertical farming can start to shine through.\n\nD.I.Y Solutions\n\nFor the daring and adventurous, there's no challenge too big or small – like building your own Vertical farming solutions. When outdoor space is available for use, vertical spaces can easily be turned into productive spaces through everyday items, as seen in this blog post here, by Bryn Huntpalmer.\n\nMaking use of outdoor space can also include freestanding structures as well, such as standing vertical pipes or A-frames. Many of these projects can be constructed from second-hand materials or easily acquirable materials. Some companies and individuals even go so far as to share complete instructions and guides on the internet, like this one, sponsored by a company called BLT Robotics.\n\nThe project in question, dubbed RUFS (Robotic Urban Farm System) includes a list of all materials and lengths/sizes required, a step by step construction guide, and because this is a more high-tech project, it also includes a coding and setup guide for the IOT components of the project (We'll be covering IOT integration into vertical farming in a future post, so make sure you subscribe to catch it!)\n\nIf however, outdoor space isn't an option, those DIY skills can set up vertical farming indoors too. A spare window provides a space in which a farming setup can be created, as seen in the design below.\n\nA vertical garden built onto a window src:\n\nPre-made Solutions\n\nThat being said, the DIY approach isn't for everyone, and while the market is still a young one, there a few companies that provide, or are in the process of being able to provide, pre-built vertical farming solutions.\n\nCityCrop is one such example, with their self-titled product scheduled for release at the end of 2017. The two-tier tower appears to allow for 24 separate plants to be grown. A companion app allows the user to specify which plants are being grown in each of the 24 slots, and the system handles the rest from there, customising the water and lighting requirements for each plant. The range of plants that the system knows how to grow ranges from leafy greens, microgreens and herbs, through to a small collection of fruits and edible flowers. The system has an indicative price of £700 which is around $1300 NZD.\n\nFuture Solutions\n\nAs mentioned, the market for urban vertical farming solutions is still a young one and has a way to go yet before it starts to gather momentum. What does the future look like and what are the solutions that we're likely to see? While the future is ever changing, an educated guess would suggest that urban farming set-ups become commonplace technology, and just like it's common for a house to have a fridge or a microwave, vertical farming appliances would also become common, with houses having one or more of them.\n\nDesigns, like the one above by George Sawyer, illustrate what these growing environments might look like, built right into the kitchen. The sleek and professional look is something that comes with time and development – when the demand is there, companies make better products.", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "c9b0d20b-9416-4903-abd6-e8646c5fcb0c", "url": "https://techscriptor.nz/vertical-farming-for-the-home/"}

{"text": "Winter months in the greenhouse are a good time to see where your operation could be more efficient to save on energy, especially heating bills. Now's the time to check out what is and isn't working and what you might like to change for next season.\n\nThree main areas to look at for improved efficiencies in the greenhouse are energy curtains, boilers and greenhouse coverings.\n\n1. Energy Curtains Energy curtains can have benefits all year round, but are best known for their insulating properties in the winter. Several different styles and materials exist, with varying levels of insulation and light transmission. Materials with greater insulating power have higher R-values and can help to lower heating costs. The right curtain (or curtains) for your operation will depend on what crops you grow and the level of control you would like over the climate in your greenhouse. In addition to overhead curtains, sidewalls and end curtains help to maintain a more consistent greenhouse environment around the perimeter and should be maintained.\n\nMultiple layers of curtains can increase the control you have over temperature and light levels in the greenhouse. Double layer curtains that open over the course of several stages in a staggered pattern provide better control over the speed with which cold air from above the curtain is allowed to mix with the warmer air below. Curtains that have light diffusion properties to help improve light quality in the greenhouse can be installed under curtains that control light emission or allow for blackout if needed, allowing for better control of light in and out of the greenhouse.\n\nRegularly check for tears and holes in your curtains and ensure they are opening and closing easily. Be prepared to replace curtains as they age. Regular visual inspections and checks of your climate control systems settings will help let you know if the curtain is opening at the correct speed, and how the cold air above the curtain is mixing with the warmer air below.\n\n2. Boilers Boilers are a necessary part of heating a greenhouse, but they aren't all created equal. Traditional firebox boilers have expected efficiencies of around 80 per cent, while high efficiency condensing boilers can have upwards of 95 per cent efficiency. A properly sized condensing boiler can also have the ability to fire at a lower output level, therefore causing fewer spikes and dips in the heating load while increasing efficiencies. High efficiency condensing boilers have a much larger upfront cost, but the increased efficiency will result in greater long-term energy savings.\n\nConsider targeting the majority of the heat to where the crop is located. Perimeter heating and ensuring snow melt from roofs are necessary parts of growing through Ontario winters. However, heated floors and under-bench pipes can help keep heat near the crop, making sure that the growing environment is best at crop level. Fans that circulate air throughout ranges can also help to create a more even growing environment.\n\nMaintenance and servicing of any boiler should be done on a regular basis. Upgrades to existing heating systems such as heat exchangers, variable speed boiler pumps, heat storage tanks and even simply insulating pipes can all help in gaining efficiencies.\n\n3. Greenhouse Coverings Take a look across the greenhouse floriculture industry and you'll see a wide variety of greenhouse covering materials. Glass, polyethylene film and various types of polycarbonate are all used for various purposes and crops. Some growers like the control that glass gives them, others prefer the energy savings of double-walled polycarbonate.\n\nWhen choosing a new covering, a balance between good light transmission and heat insulation is needed. This balance may differ depending on which crops you grow and when in the year. For example, some glass and poly materials can be made in a way to improve light diffusion, which may provide additional benefits. Certain acrylic materials are able to allow UV into the greenhouse, creating an environment that's protected but has lighting that is more similar to an outdoor field. As with energy curtains, covering materials with greater insulating power have higher R-values and can help lower heating costs.\n\nIt's also good practice to ensure that coverings are well-fitted around pipes, vents and gutters to avoid gaps where heat can easily escape the greenhouse. Try to replace ripped loading dock curtains and weather stripping around doors promptly. Keeping an eye on these seals may also help increase your biosecurity.\n\nUpkeep is key Overall, it's important to remember that proper upkeep and maintenance (including scheduled replacement) is necessary to see efficiencies. Scheduling the opening of curtains or cycling of boilers only works if your climate control system is correct; so be sure to check how they operate and adjust as necessary! Knowing the energy savings you expect to see from a more efficient boiler or upgraded greenhouse covering is important to determine if the payback period on an investment is right for your business.\n\nInterested in how the images for this article were obtained? We used a heat-sensitive camera. Warmer areas can be seen in shades of red, orange and yellow, whereas areas that are cooler are in purple and blue. A relatively inexpensive attachment for your smartphone ($500) and the free FLIR One app are all you need to check out your greenhouse in this way too!

Camping outside of developed campgrounds, commonly known as dry camping or boondocking, requires a reliable power source beyond the RV's battery to fuel the appliances you need to enjoy your experience in the great outdoors. From your refrigerator to your stovetop, to additional portable appliances you might bring, the RV generator is a must-have for all RVers who set up shop away from the campgrounds. That's why we talk a bit in this video about the essentials of picking the right generator for your RV, depending on size and power capacity.\n\nGenerator Tips for RV Trips\n\nWe'll begin by walking you through an explanation of the common types of generators that you'll find at your local hardware store. When choosing the right generator for your RV, you have to first decide what makes the most sense for your needs. To help you determine your ideal generator for the RV in your life, Dave Solberg describes the difference between onboard and portable generators, and explains how you might choose one or the other based on your power preferences. This is dependent upon whether you opt for a propane, fuel or diesel power source.\n\nTo further demonstrate the ideal method for selecting a generator for your RV, Dave teaches you how to select the size of your generator by factoring in your available power wattage and things such as the number of air conditioner vents on your RV roof. Also, you'll learn why your choice depends on whether your prospective generator will be connected to a j-box for direct current or a distribution center to be switched over from alternating current. With Dave's help, you'll have no trouble figuring out which generator for RV is perfect for you.When you're boondocking in the wide open spaces with no street lights or other rigs around, having an outside light is crucial and expected all night long. Move your RV to a park or campground, though, and having a porch light on all night long can really annoy the neighbors.

{"text": "Ghee – the powerhouse used in Indian cooking\n\nGhee is clarified butter with its milk solids and water removed. It occupies an important position in an Indian pantry. According to Ayurveda – India's nutritional sciences, Ghee (clarified butter) used in moderation is the best oil for cooking for many reasons. Simmering unsalted butter in a large pot until all water has boiled off and protein has settled to the bottom makes ghee and the cooked and clarified butter is then spooned off to avoid disturbing the milk solids on the bottom of the pan. Unlike butter, ghee can be stored for extended periods without refrigeration, provided it is kept in an airtight container to prevent oxidation and remains moisture-free.\n\nAccording to ancient medicinal science of India Ayurveda, the ingestion of Ghee is like offering the finest of fuels into the fires of digestion-Agni and in accord with this, Ghee builds the aura, makes all the organs soft, builds up the internal juices of the body-Rasa, which are destroyed by aging and increases the most refined element of digestion-Shukra or Ojas, the underlying basis of all immunity and the \"essence of all bodily tissues\". One of the Ayurvedic experts calls Ghee the \"single most ojas producing food on earth\". Ghee is known to increase intelligence–Dhi, refine the intellect-Buddhi and improve the memory-Smrti.\n\nThere is one very important difference in the way Ghee was and is made in India. The Indians start out with milk from a cow, just like in America. But, they do not let the cream rise to the top and skim it off as we do in the West, instead, and here comes the key difference- they culture the milk with yogurt, allowing it to sit for 4-5 hours, just before it becomes completely soured. Then they churn the whole milk. From that point on, the process is more or less the same and this culturing with yogurt introduces another form of Fire-Agni into the substance of refining the milk into butter and then Ghee.", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "9df1363b-818c-40e6-82b0-2c939d2ff1dc", "url": "http://www.ayushveda.com/magazine/ghee-the-powerhouse-used-in-indian-cooking-2/"}

{"text": "The first full-body, motion-sensing controller, released in 1993, for the Sega Genesis/Mega Drive console and the Dragon Ball Z VRVS arcade game. It was an octagonal ring of sensors that control on-screen movement when a player stands in the center and strikes over specific sections.\n\nSummary\n\nShort summary describing this accessory.\n\nOverview\n\nThe Sega Activator is an octogon-shaped ring that was placed on the floor and plugged into the Genesis controller port. The product was based on the Light Harp invented by martial artist and musician, Assaf Gurner, and produced by Sega and Interactive Light. It was the first full-body motion controller, more than a decade before the Wiimote or Kinect.\n\nThe player would stand in the middle of the ring, which emitted infrared light beams directly up, and sensed their reflections back from the ceiling. The player's movements over each section would break the beamsand trigger some form of in-game action. Beams could be broken high (hands) or low (feet), producing sixteen distinct inputs.\n\nSega Mega Drive / Genesis\n\nMarketing implied the Activator was similar to a free-range motion-capture device, with commercials showing players performing martial arts moves in the ring and seeing them translated in-game. However, the system was actually designed only for the player to make specific movements that were analogous to buttons pressed on a controller (e.g. wave hand over the section mapped to the \"A\" button to perform that action). The mechanics are naturally similar to the original Light Harp's mapping of specific sections to notes, or keys on a keyboard. The player was free to punch and kick, but it would only correctly register if they did so over the right beam.\n\nThe Activator could work with any Genesis game by emulating a 3-button pad. The user would assign buttons to each of the eight sections, including direction pad up, down, left, and right. Additionally, combination moves (pressing two buttons at once by breaking two beams at once) were not supported. Only three games were specifically programmed to recognize the Activator's full range of inputs: Eternal Champions, Mortal Kombat, and Comix Zone.\n\nVaulted or mirrored ceilings interrupted the IR beams' reflections, along with irregular roof beams, ceiling fans, or similar obstructions. The Activator also required its own standalone power supply (another 9V brick; typical of Sega's consoles of the time), and retailed for $80. High cost, lack of support, and restrictive gameplay all contributed to the controller being quietly discontinued.\n\nDragon Ball Z VRVS\n\nUnlike the console peripheral, this Dragon Ball Z game used extra sensors for better reaction detection, so that the player's movements match the on-screen actions, making it the first successful example of full-body motion sensing.", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "d63a3b81-a574-4105-b2a0-8dbf0a9998e7", "url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/sega-activator/3000-8/"}

{"text": "Lost Antarctica: Adventures in a Disappearing Land\n\nIan Thompson C.R.E.W. October 2019\n\nHOOVER HIGH SCHOOL - At first glance, it looked like a PowerPoint presentation in the cafeteria at Hoover High School (HHS). But the massed students were about to be \"transported away\" to the vast and mystical continent of Antarctica, with explorer, researcher and UAB professor Dr. James McClintock as their very special guide.\n\nAntarctica is the icy continent at the South Pole, often called \"The Frozen Continent.\" Although scientific expeditions visit Antarctica, there are no permanent human residents. McClintock noted it takes almost a week to reach it from Birmingham, flying to Chile and then taking five days by boat. He is typically based at Palmer Station on the Antarctic Peninsula, previously at McMurdo Station, a U.S. research station, and will be gone for months on end.\n\nClose to six months in the planning, the Advanced Placement (AP) Environmental Science classes at Hoover, Spain Park, Mountain Brook and Vestavia high schools came together at this lecture held in mid-October.\n\nTitled Lost Antarctica: Adventures in a Disappearing Land, the Hoover High School cafeteria served as the setting for McClintock, the endowed university professor of Polar and Marine Biology at UAB, as he spoke about climate change and a myriad of related subjects.\n\nMoving along with an engaging presentation, McClintock presented data and stories for more than an hour, before breaking for questions.\n\nOrt noted that she was brainstorming with her colleagues from other area schools and they all determined they wanted to bring in a speaker to light a fire within their students.\n\n\"We all think Mr. McClintock is pretty cool and pretty fabulous.

{"text": "Who can benefit from gentle teaching\n\nGentle teaching is often seen as an approach especially for people with an intellectual disability and severe behavior problems. This maybe because in the early years of gentle teaching the emphasis was on the need of these people for a more humane support.\n\nWe know that most behavior problems are caused by feelings of insecurity or fear. Due to the domineering approach of these people, this fear will rather increase than decrease.\n\nThe effect of gentle teaching on people who are labeled as behavior problems is that the relationship between them and the caregivers improve and that they will feel better. Usually this will result in decrease of the behavior problems, but not always. Changing the behaviors is not the goal of gentle teaching. The central goals of gentle teaching is to help the person feel safe and loved in warm relationships with others.\n\nExperiences show that – even if the behavior of the person doesn't change – the relationship does improve and caregivers enjoy their work more. The old negative image of the behavior lost its meaning.\n\nActually gentle teaching is suitable for everybody. Is may not be a cure for all wounds, but it is an approach many people can benefit from. For whom would it be good to feel criticized or rejected or for which caregivers would it be nice to be irritated by the behaviors of people they serve.\n\nGentle teaching assumes that for everybody it's important to engaged in safe and loving relationships. In these relationships you don't have to fight with the other, but you can guide him in a loving way through the difficult moments in life.\n\nThis goes for people with an intellectual disability, people with a mental illness, people with dementia, children, etc. Gentle teaching is for all people who feel marginalized or are at risk of becoming marginalized.", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "10d0b81e-cede-4f66-8cf9-2b48dfe2c882", "url": "https://gentleteaching.nl/gentle/en/for-who/102-for-who"}
{"text": "You are here\n\nWorshiping the Lord\n\nNehemiah 12, Chronicles 25\n\nLanguage\nEnglish\n\nYear:\n\n2019\n\nQuarter:\n\n4\n\nLesson Number:\n\n10\n\nLesson 10 Worshiping the Lord\n\n(Nehemiah 12, 1 Chronicles 25 Worship styles! Want to start a fight? Just take a firm position on that issue. Some churches resolve the matter by using different worship styles at different services. Have a preference? Attend the service that reflects your views. In my old church, we had different types of music on different Sabbaths. That solution made people happy some of the time. My current church began with firm beliefs specifically about the style of worship because the founders believed it was critical to reaching nonbelievers. Their views on music are my views, so it has been an easy choice for me. The real issue is not my preference or yours, but rather what does the Bible teach us about music and worship? Let's plunge into our study and learn more!\n\nWorship and the Wall\n\nRead Nehemiah 12:27. What is the reason for this gathering? (To dedicate the wall of Jerusalem.)\n\nWould you call that worship? (To whom are they dedicating the wall? If they are dedicating it to God, then I would call it worship.)\n\nWhat is the overall tone of the dedication? (They \"celebrate joyfully.\")\n\nDoes that reflect what is going on in your church during worship?\n\nWhat kind of music did they use? (Singing. The instruments mentioned are cymbals, harps and lyres. I think we understand cymbals and harps. A lyre appears to my uneducated eye as a cross between a guitar and a harp. It is a stringed instrument.)\n\nWhat was the theme of their music? (Thanksgiving!)\n\nHave you analyzed the music you sing at church?\n\nWhen I was growing up much of it seemed to be celebrating God's followers and not God. Is that a problem?\n\nHave you criticized worship music because it is simple and repeats the same phrase? If so, read Revelation 4:8 and explain the practices at headquarters.\n\nRead Nehemiah 12:28-29. Who sang? (People designated as musicians traveled to the dedication.)\n\nIs there a lesson in this for church worship?\n\nLet's skip down and read Nehemiah 12:43. What is the dominant them for this worship? (Rejoicing.)\n\nIs that the dominant theme for worship in your church?\n\nIs your worship more conducive to worshiping or sleeping?\n\nI recall visiting a church where the pastor preached so long and in such an uninteresting way that I literally fell asleep. I'm sure it was just for a very short period of time. But, when I awoke I looked around and saw that everyone in the church had also fallen asleep. When I mentioned this remarkable thing to my wife, she responded that we were praying, which was why everyone had their eyes closed. My question and her response struck us as being so funny that we were having a terrible time being quiet during the prayer.\n\nLook again at Nehemiah 12:43, the last part. Who else could not sleep during this worship service? (The neighbors! The Bible tells us the sound of rejoicing \"could be heard far away.\")\n\nWorship Organization\n\nRead Nehemiah 12:31 and Nehemiah 12:38-39. Consider what this would look like. What does this reflect? (Organization. Preparation. An eye for how things look. I'm sure this procession looked impressive.)\n\nHow does your church rate when it comes to the organization of your worship? Is it put together on the spot? Does anyone pay any attention to how things look?\n\nDo you recall any examples of a worship that looked great and was well-organized?\n\nDo you recall any examples of a worship that looked bad and was disorganized?\n\nWhat is the reason for a disorganized, bad looking worship? (Worship services are disorganized when people fail to take the time to do things right. It reflects a lack of preparation and taking matters seriously.)\n\nTwo weeks ago I preached in a small church that had a beautiful front of the sanctuary. You walked in and it looked very impressive. I recall another small church I visited where the front of the church had a prominent plumbing pipe sticking out of the wall that looked terrible. I suspect the members were so used to the pipe that they did not think anything about it. In the first church the members who built it were particular about the details. In the second church, they didn't care very much. Which one of these examples is more like your church?\n\nRead 1 Chronicles 25:1-2 and 1 Chronicles 25:6-7. Notice the repeated reference to both supervision and training. Should those who participate in the worship service at church be supervised and trained?\n\nI'm often asked to preach. With God's blessings and hard work on my part, I think the result brings glory to God. However, no one ever asks me to sing. Any idea why that is?\n\nWhen I'm teaching or preaching, I never try to sneak in a little singing. Any idea why that is?\n\nShould a church be less selective in choosing singers than choosing preachers? Should singers (or those praying, calling for the offering, or reading the scripture) try to sneak in a little preaching?\n\nShould a church have some hard rules against unrequested and unauthorized preaching? Or, is the unrequested unauthorized stuff a reflection of the leading of the Holy Spirit? (I never want to quench the Holy Spirit, but I think both supervision and training are important to excellence in worship.)\n\nSacrifices and the Wall\n\nRe-read Nehemiah 12:43. What do you think the people (actually the priests) were doing when they \"offered great sacrifices?\" (They were sacrificing animals.)\n\nHow is killing animals consistent with joy? (One commentary said that these sacrifices would be \"thank offerings.\" The people are able to participate in eating these sacrifices. This as one big barbecue!)\n\nRead 1 John 1:7-9. What does this suggest about the followers of God?\n\nWe previously mentioned the fact that the people were dedicating the wall. I suggested that it was a form of worship because they were dedicating it to God. It is possible that they were dedicating it to being a strong wall? A wall to defeat their enemies?\n\nWould it be more appropriate, given what we have studied so far, to conclude they were rejoicing over the safety of the completed wall?\n\nWhy did they need to rebuild the wall? (There are two plausible reasons for the dedication. First, Jerusalem had fallen because God's people were unfaithful to Him. I think they wanted to purify everything, including the wall, to make it part of God's holy city. Second, the wall was a source of protection and a sign that they had overcome the opposition of their enemies. 1 John 1:7 tells us that being in a right relationship with God is our goal. That, and defeating your enemies, are two good reasons to rejoice with God.)\n\nLet's look at the two texts that bracket the one we just read. Read 1 John 1:6 and 1 John 1:10. What are the two extremes that we must avoid? (Living a life that does not reflect our fellowship with God. Claiming that we live a perfect life when we do not.)\n\nHow do these extremes reflect poorly on the glory of God?\n\nRead Nehemiah 12:46. Should our lives reflect our songs? (Yes! Songs are one form of communication. Our lives should be about praise and thanksgiving to God!)", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "2fe738b9-39cb-4ccc-8bc1-af01ea258b5c", "url": "http://www.gobibletranslations.org/node/2155"}

He added that he does his best to make sure he's someone young baseball fans can look up to.\n\n\"I try to do the same to these kids,\" Graveman said. \"They're excited to be out here, and to be genuine and to be sincere when I meet them. If they ask for an autograph or a picture, to be able to say yeah.\"\n\nGraveman wasn't randomly selected for this event. He studied mechanical engineering at Mississippi State and is a STEM supporter. He avidly studies the connection between baseball and engineering, a relationship those at the event tried to convey to the kids.\n\n\"We track spin, and how we track velocity on a pitch and how we track the distance that you see on SportsCenter,\" Graveman said. \"You see that ball carried 440 feet, well that's engineering and that's math. That's one of the things I can think on maybe a little bit of a deeper basis than some guys, because I've got a background in it. \"\n\nWhile Graveman met Little Leaguers in the outfield, former Athletic Willie McGee taught them how to hit in the infield, at one of many stations set up around the Coliseum.\n\nRhonda Morris, vice president of human resources for Downstream, Chevron, grew up in Oakland, and has been a lifelong A's fan.\n\nFor her, Tuesday was a chance to bridge two of her favorite things -- baseball and education -- and inspire kids to develop similar passions.\n\n\"For us to have the opportunity to take kids who are really passionate about baseball and Little League and connect that to learning and education and science and technology and math is absolutely fantastic,\" Morris said.", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "87acc096-837c-414f-853e-786268d24391", "url": "https://www.mlb.com/news/as-host-stem-clinic-for-little-leaguers/c-133873324"}

That's why the company has been aggressively discounting its Alexa-powered devices, including various Echo models, Fire TV Cube, and the Echo Look.\n\nThese devices all allow users to use voice commands to do anything from play music or ask what the weather is going to be to control smart home devices. Amazon's Alexa-powered devices also let people order from the online retailer -- even though that's not something most people have been using them for.\n\nAmazon wants consumers to buy its Echo devices. Image source: Amazon.\n\nWhat is Amazon doing?\n\nSince Thanksgiving, Amazon has made selling its own devices a core part of its holiday strategy. It has offered its entire family of devices on sale, with the various Echo models, Fire TV Cube, and Echo Look being marked down considerably.\n\nThe strategy worked. Customers \"purchased a record number of Amazon devices globally\" during the period from Thanksgiving through Cyber Monday, according to a press release. It was the biggest holiday shopping period for the various Echo devices ever, according to the company, and the digital assistant was the top-selling \"product on Amazon globally, from any manufacturer, in any category.\"\n\nAmazon has kept up that momentum by keeping many of its devices on sale through the end of the holiday season. Customers, for example, can buy an Echo Dot (3rd generation) for $29.99 (down from $49.99), a Fire TV Cube for $69.99 (down from $119.99), and an Echo Look for $49.99 (down from $199.99) as of Dec. 20.\n\nWhy is Amazon doing this?\n\nThe online retailer has flooded the market by offering its Alexa-powered devices at cut-rate prices. That's not the company being magnanimous, it's about capturing market share. Consumers may not be using these devices to order from Amazon in large numbers, and they may only be dabbling with using them as smart home hubs. That doesn't matter.\n\nAmazon isn't worried about now. It wants to have a huge installed base of customers talking with Alexa. As long as that happens, the company will eventually be able to get consumers to use the devices to order from the online retailer.\n\nThis is Amazon betting that it will eventually have an easy-to-use store in everyone's living room. As consumers get used to talking to Alexa, it seems logical that they will eventually make the leap to using it for purchases. Even if they don't, Amazon can monetize in other ways as people order services through the device or expand their home automation efforts.\n\nIs it working?\n\nAmazon is attempting to flood the market as a way to keep Alphabet(NASDAQ:GOOG)(NASDAQ:GOOGL) from gaining market share. It's hard to know definitively if that's working, since neither company releases hard sales numbers on its devices. It does, however, appear to be anecdotally successful, as Amazon has clearly leveraged its sales platform to increase the number of homes with one or more Alexa devices.\n\nBasically, Amazon is building an army of customers who use Alexa. They may use the digital assistant mostly to play music or to answer basic questions. That doesn't matter in the short term. They're using the platform, and ultimately Amazon should be able to figure out how to make that use profitable.", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "d32732a1-72fe-46a6-a7dd-33b13387a5a9", "url": "https://www.fool.com/investing/2018/12/21/3-amazon-products-on-sale-this-holiday-season.aspx"}

Yeah.\nNot only is this a dance, but it's a beautiful song. Alright, let me see it. Oh wow. Pretty good.\nWhat's the question– One question that everyone asks you about the show?– Working on the show? I mean most of the questions are about, like, how we choose episodes.\nOh, really? Yeah, yeah. Or, like, what the process is of like– Like, why would we do, like, MBS and then also, like, cruise ships. Oh, the gamut issue. World issues to, like, cruise ship. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Well it's like we'll cruise ships are fucking interesting. Yeah. What do you tell them? Are you just like– I'm just like, \"Yo, like watch the episode. It's amazing.\" You don't answer the question. I never– I never answer the question, I just say go watch. There we go. What's the question you get asked the most? That's actually very similar to what I get. Really?\nYeah, yeah, yeah. \"How do you guys choose episodes?\" \"Why don't you do this?\" I'll get pitched a lot. \"You guys should– You guys should totally–\" Oh my God, yeah. There's so many people in my DMs asking if they can intern for me. Nice.\nYeah. And I want to be like \"That's not–\" Like, I can't hire my own intern. That could never happen. That'd be amazing if you just, in your office, there was just another chair. And I was like, \"What?\" What's going on here? Yeah, we set up shop here.\n\"Oh, it's my Instagram DM intern.\" Do you want to go to this red– This little red… We'll go to like the furthest out… part of the map. Why does it have that [siren sound]? Why does it sound like a bus is driving by? Well 'cause we're on– we're on a party bus. That's the thing we're jumping out of. Dude, it's pretty peaceful when you're just… you know I mean? No, there's something, like, really serene about just, like, looking out at the beautiful ocean. That's the Atlantic Ocean. Can we fact check that? Let's get fact check on that, Ted. Can we fact check that, please. Yeah. Where's the research department? Which ocean is this? Does Beena watch the show? Yeah. She'll come to the taping, and then she'll actually watch it on Sunday morning–Sunday mornings to see how it all came together.\nOh damn. That's so cool. My parents watch the show every weekend. Nice. It's like they're, like, Sunday morning. Yeah. They would watch it, like, if I didn't write on it. Meeting your dad was awesome. Oh, so this is good. We have time to just, like, chill right now. So, you gotta find a gun. Yeah, it's a straight up junkyard over here. Alright, if you come to me. Are you not in the same…? Oh. There you go. Oh, there you are. If you smack that down, then you can grab this gun. Are you serious right now? Like, just break! Alright, right here?\nYeah, yeah, yeah. Okay, if you press square on that. There we go. Oh, dude your outfit's awesome. Thank you.\nOh, someone's building. Someone is here. Oh shit.\nWhere is this person at? You know my biggest problem is? I don't know where the fuck people are. Where do I go? Um, hold on. I got us. I'm building up. You've got a straight up edifice. Oh shit. Its_Chaosss, why do you have to do that? Should we talk about the Video Games episode at all? Yeah. How do you feel about that episode? I thought it was great. I thought it was a great trojan horse to get us into talking about unions via something that people really enjoy. I thought it was cool to see so many people actually in the gaming industry be like, \"Oh, dude. Thank you for talking about this. Like this is a real thing that we actually go through. We've been talking about this for a long time. It was– It's always cool getting, like, big upped by people that are, like, kind of really in that community being like you of shed light on this thing that we've been talking about for a long time. Alright, we're gonna– If you look to your right.\nYes. We're gonna jump out now. Oh! You know another question that I've wanted to ask you and now that we're streaming, I gotta ask. what's your favorite episode. What's your favorite episode? Yeah.\nWow. I have a bunch I like for different reasons. Video Games definitely was one of them. Supreme. Amazon was really fun. Oh, Amazon was super fun. Indian Elections. Super fun. There's a lot. And every episode has something in it that's, like– that was like fun for different reason. Like cricket had Lalit. You know, Lalit Modi was just–\nOh my God. Well, yeah. Wait– Yeah. Can you tell us about that experience? Like, walk in– into his house. Yeah. You know how, like, some people on camera, you know you'll just– People will ask you, they'll be like \"Are they really, really like that?\" And I'm like, \"He's even better.\" The cameras actually don't do him justice. So what do I do here at the watering hole? I feel like this is a trap for sure. Oh my God. Where– I don't even think that exists in the game. Where did you go? Where are you? Does water gives me safety? I don't think water gives you safety. Yeah, yeah. At this point, just see what's out there, man. Do you want me to just go to the edge? Let's see what's at the edge. Alright, let's jump.\nOh, no. Let's see what's up. Hasancide. What? Oh, Dan… [laughing] What happened to you? Did you die or are you still in?\nNah, dude. I'm good. Ah, dude you just like… Oh wait, if you press circle. Communication abuse. What's that? Oh, wow. This is hilarious. You should report someone for you killing yourself. Well I'm reporting you for communication abuse. My teammate… How do I do this. He told me– My teammate convinced me to commit suicide.\nto kill myself. Alright, I'm gonna– I'm thriving out here. You know what? I'm just done. I'm just gonna report as is.\n\"He.\" They'll know. They'll know. Sent. Sending. Thanks. Hasan_Bhai said, \"He.\" Justice better be served. There will be an investigation. What's the longest you could play Fortnite straight? I get frustrated after, like, an hour and a half. I've played for like 24 hours straight.\nStraight? Straight. No sleeping?\nNo sleep. What hiatus was this during? This was pre-Patriot Act? This was pre-Patriot Act. Remember the early days of Patriot Act?\nI remember the early days. Different world. Where are you headed? What's your agenda right now, Zach? My agenda is get to this big ass robot. This thing right here. Oh, someone's already in it though. Yeah, snipe it. No damage? Does that do anything to it? Oh shit. Is he going to try to hit you? Yeah. Oh no. Oh fuck. Oh God. Wow! This dude can take out trees and you're just building Fucking forts. Oh Jesus! Now there also–\nNo! Ah! Rocket launchers? Yeah, dude. Things ain't good. You straight up poked the bear. I don't think he knows where I am though right now. Sneak attack. Where did he go? Just go in the cabin. Go in the cabin. You're right, you're right, you're right. Just chill in the cabin for a lil' bit. Close the door. Let's go. Wow! Nice. He had really good weapons. Oh, this dude was a vigilante. Oh should I get in this boy? Whoa. Alright, what's the move here. Oh, dude my shit's rumbling, too. Really?\nYeah. Damn. Giving my boss a rumble. Can I do Inside the Actor's Studio with you? What's your favorite curse word? The F-word, dude. Is Lipton still doing his thing? Oh shit. I gotta get out. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. You're just self-imploding? Fuck. Hold on. Let's pause on the Lipton. Okay. What are you doing right now? Like, what is this? Oh shit, shit. Fuck. I was trying– I was trying to build a fort as quickly as possible. So that he couldn't kill me, but Mr. Tennis got to me no matter what. You ever run into someone from high school here? In Fortnite? Yeah. You'll be like, you'll be like, \"Brian?!\" I mean, I wonder like, what, like, celebrities or, like, weird people I have played Fortnite with and I will never know. Like, I probably played with, like, Bill Clinton. Oh, that's good. I mean, I checked your account. You have like 250 friend requests. Someone saw the episode, saw Hasan_Bhai, pysspapa, and added both of us.\nOh wow! Yeah. We should add 'em. Just to see. Just to… Should we go see? Yeah. Well, yeah. Press circle. If you go down. IAmLegend… Should we just add them all? …, catdogdrake, of course. Well, yeah. Who do you want to be friends with? Catdogdrake. Boss Volcano, you're in. Daddy Chilli.\nDamn, CT0430 did not make the cut. Nah, he's not in. Yeah, that's true. Dr. Arvid. I don't need a doctor. Drone Daddy? Is there a drone– Too many DJs. Yeah. DroneAddict. You need someone on drones. duckfartmike. duckfartmike seems like he's serious. Those are his three favorite things. Duck. Fart. Mike. I think James Lipton is probably 78. Yo, I think he's 93. Oooh. Oh!\nJames Lipton is 92?! Is he still doing it? What?! They had new eps dropping last year? Yeah. When Patriot Act launched, they were launching episodes? That's why he quit. Okay, so the reason I'm taking us here is because I think we have a good chance of surviving for a good amount of time. What's the highest you've ever gotten?\nI've won a bunch of times. What?!\nYeah. What do you end up winning when you win? I mean, you don't get anything. Just respect? You get the respect of your peers. Belief in yourself. I gained a ton of confidence. I got like a good weapon to start with, too. You do your thing. I'm just gonna chill at the top of this pyramid. Ah, dude. There's someone with you? I came here for solitude. The F-word is a good curse word like all purpose. It's the right one. Yeah. I would just say it serves as an exclamation point. It lets people know you are very serious. It's also a verb. It's also a verb. It's a noun. It's just a lot of things. Oh, shit. I didn't even consider it's noun usage. The noun usage is \"Oh, this guy's a fuck.\" Oh no. Really? You're just gonna light me up like that? Cool. Wait, wait. Did you do that whole game without the headphones on? Yeah I could hear it. I could just hear the bang. I wanted to hear the sound of your voice, man. I wanted a have a real conversation. My dulcet tones. Yeah, man in IRL. For me, it was N64. That was was the console. I played Goldeneye. Mario Karts.\nDid you have an N64.\nI had an N64. And Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time. How have they never made a Zelda movie? I feel like Link is such a great character. Wait, we can't put this on the stream 'cause you gotta make that. You can't put that out into the world.\nWhat?! Because someone else is gonna make it then. Yeah, but I'm not the one to helm Link's story. Why not? Don't you think it would be a great–\nWe can reimagine Link as an Indian man. How come video game movies don't translate? Are there any video game movies that translate? Everyone cringes. Everyone cringes when a video game– Uncharted is gonna be made. They're making Halo into a Showtime series. Yeah. Yeah. Dude, I fucking like Tomb Raider. Fuck the haters. Was Detective Pikachu Good? But it was the closest. Oh, dude. How are we sleeping on those? Why are we sleeping on Angry Birds? There's two Angry Birds?! It's just Christopher Walken. It's like his Norbit. Norbit is an all timer. The movie? For me. Yeah. That's with Eddie Murphy, right? Yeah, yeah. A classic video game adaptation. Yeah. That was an Atari game, right? Norbit was an Atari game? [laughs] Norbit for Atari. Yeah. It came out before Pong. Absolutely not. But I think we should keep this, definitely, in the office. I'll be honest with you right now just because I feel like we're bonding over Fortnite.\nSure. I've been playing in my office. All the time.\nI believe it. I have 2K. And so I've been in there with my created player. He's 5 foot 3 and he dunks. What?!\nYeah. What happens if I go in the lava? I assume I die. Oh man, we're so far. Dude you're so far from– You're like in the suburbs. Dude, you've changed.\nI fucking left your ass. I'm sorry. Dude, you have changed. It's like we were buddies in high school and like– Dude, I just wanted to settle down. It's a slow lifestyle.\nI'm out here living in lava. And you just moved out to the burbs. Dude, I want to build a family. It's hard to do that on lava. Wow. Okay, here we go. Alright, well here's the thing I got my own little lava island. Alright, let's see if I just… Do you still talk to any of any of your friends from college? You know what, a buddy of mine from one of my first job out of college came to one of the tapings two weeks ago. Oh really?\nYeah. Thank you so much for coming, Evan. Yeah. Shouts out to Evan. Evan, thanks for coming, man. That's really cool of you. What was–Yeah, wait. What job was it? First job out of college. Yeah. I basically worked IT. I got fired though. What?!\nYeah. I wasn't really into it.\nWhat did you you do to get fired? I just wasn't good at my job. You're on fire right now, Hasan. How am I doing?\nTop 42. Woo! You cannot stop me.\nNo weapons, just running. Oh, here we go. Wait, no, no, no. Don't break that. Don't break that! Why? Why, why, why, why? Let me live. 'Cause you–Look down at the chest and hold square. Hold it. There you go. Oh, wait. You got to get in the bush. Dude, give me the bush. Okay. R1. R1 again. And then hold R2. R2. Wait, what? Hasan, are you okay? I'm straight Flora and Fauna now. My man is goddamn foliage. Alright, should I lock in? Here we go. I mean that is, like, the ultimate pro move is Fortnite without volume.\nFor real?\nHasan is so good that he doesn't even need to hear the game. The music and shit gives me anxiety. Okay, so stay right here. If you click the right joystick. Okay, now no one can see you. You just are a bush. From their vantage point, I'm a running bush, right?\nYes, right now. But if you– if you were to just, like, crouch like you were before, no one could tell that you were a person. Let's do it. Yeah. Dude, you idiots. Look at this. This is why violence isn't the answer. I've officially opted out of all this nonsense. Zach, this is genius. Yeah. Okay, wait. Now you gotta run into that circle though. There you go. We're gonna win this game. Oh wait. Oh no. Oh no. Just stay. Just stay there. Oh no. He knew! How did he know? How did he know! Who's fucking leaking info? Dude who leaked?\nWho leaked in the administration? How'd he know? I think he saw a running bush and was like, \"I should kill that.\" Ahh, Biryani_14, why do you do that. Fuck, Bryan. Never mind.\nYou translate Bryan to Biryani automatically. Now you know what I'm thinking about. Are we going to do the full episode on it? Dude, give me the full 30. I need at least two field pieces on it. What was your favorite RPG? I really liked Metal Gear Solid. Metal Gear Solid's great. Yeah. I played–I mean, my favorite game growing up was Kingdom Hearts. You've ever heard of that? Kingdom Hearts is great. Yeah, yeah, yeah. The opening music's great. Oh my– I fuckin'– I still run to that. It is like the best work out song I've ever heard. Just on loop? Oh, on loop, yeah. Straight. \"Simple and Clean\", right?\n\"Simple and clean is the way that you're making me feel tonight.\" How many AP classes did you take in high school. I did a good hybrid of AP and Honors. Looking back on it, it wasn't worth it. Kids, if you're watching this, it's not worth it. We're gonna jump immediately. Why? 'Cause I want to go to this place Lucky Landing. Alright, jump. Aw, dude I'm trying to come in with speed. Oh, there you go. That's a freefall right there. Alright, let's go to this really beautiful flower-tree. This feels good, man. What do you mean?\nJust sitting here, shooting the shit. Aw, dude! Come on man. Did you seriously script that? What the hell? Where are you? Stay there. Dude, I'm dead. Oh, I'm not dead? I'll come get–Wait, did someone shoot you? Oh, yeah. Alright, don't do that. Dude, avenge my death, man. Please. Oh, fuck. Like right when we were having a good time. We were– I feel like we were really about to crack that open.\nI know. No chance of that now, huh? What did you–Okay, Real, real talk. What was your first impression of me when I interviewed? Oh, dude. When you interviewed and you had the Harry Potter full on cut out. Oh yeah. I was like, \"This guy's either– I don't know if this guy's for real. I don't know if this is a…\" I used to have a full on, like, 6 foot Harry Potter cut out in my room. Straight up 6 foot Daniel Radcliffe behind him and was in the Skype interview. Yeah. It's either, was just like, an elaborate, like, character thing and he's fucking with us, in which case I'm just like… we need writers. Or– And the reality was so much worse, which was that I just thought it was cool. Yeah, it was gigantic. Way bigger than Daniel Radcliffe. It, like, almost hit the ceiling of my old bedroom. It took up a lot of the Skype interview. This has been fun. At the very least, we've gotten a chance to just talk. Did you have any questions for me? What's the hardest you laughed at the show? Oooh.\nWhat, like– 'Cause I remember being at The Daily Show some of the funnest times were like on, like, tape days and like rehearsal days when you're with the writers and you're just, like, hanging out. Oh, man I think the many most fun–\nWhen you all troll each other? Oh, yeah. I mean that's the best. I mean– Oh wait. Someone just joined us! DroneAddict.\nSomeone you added joined us. One of our friends? Yeah. DroneAddict8. Dude, how do I talk to him? I don't know if he has mic.\nDude. Dude! DroneAddict? Okay, if you press triangle We'll all play. Maybe he's good. Are there any love stories where people fall in love on Fortnite? There must be. Like meet-cute? You stumble into someone's gun… those the late nights. When it's those like the late nights when it's like–\nFor real? When it's like, when it's like 2 A.M. and I get to– like during cricket, like I know you're going to like interview Lalit and like me and Ismael just get to sit and like– Oh, yeah. –come up with a thousand things to ask him. Oh, 'cause you guys were here, right? Yeah. And we know that, like, realistically, we're gonna have to ask him some, like, normal questions, but we just get to play for a while. Yeah, you guys ask some wild stuff. Yeah, that's the funnest for me, too. It's the– It's the best. It's like the stuff you know can't make it. And then if it somehow does make it in. Yeah. I feel like I really started having fun on the show when I was, like, comfortable enough with you to, like, write jokes and scripts that I knew you'd be like–you would laugh at, but we couldn't put in. Oh yeah. 'Cause I'm like this is absolutely insane. Yeah. Yeah, we've got– We've got Drone Addict8 with us. DroneAddict, come with. DroneAddict's coming. He knows what's up. Wait, DroneAddict already died? Aw, dude. We haven't even landed yet. Dude, rest in peace to our boy. Shouts out to a DroneAddict8. Dude, DroneAddict, it was really fun. I wish we'd gotten to know each other a little better. This was so much fun, man. It's funny, he doesn't even know that this is Hasan. Dude, I was just trying to, like– I honestly was trying to communicate with you DroneAddict and if you're watching this, please subscribe to our other videos, they're really good. Okay, wait, yeah. I'm gonna come to you. Oh my God. How do you somehow end up in like the most beautiful places? Oh, man. I've never seen this before. I'm running to the edge. I don't know what it is but I just feel like it's a metaphor for something. Hello? Who are you? Hey! What's up? Is this actually Hasan? Yeah. Who is this? Can you let me hear me? Here, here. Turn me on. Turn me on. Hey! Hello! Voice chat, on. I heard someone. Dude, I feel like I'm, like, on the island. You know what I mean? I'm here. This is me. How do I it like send an S.O.S.

And then, like, I watched the video again and I saw that pysspapa was also in the video and I was like, \"This has to be the real one.\" Dude, it's the pysspapa. Oh my God. I'm just– I think it's great that we're connecting. I friended you, like, a few weeks ago when I watched the episode and then I just saw.

Your choice. Yeah sure. Okay. Yeah, we'll go to Lucky Landing. It's familiar territory. Wait, Ajeet, why did you die so early last game? Yeah. How'd you get killed so fast, dude? I landed at Pressure Plant. So, yeah. Why would you abandon the squad. No, I didn't see your marker until I jumped. I don't know, untrustworthy. Wow. I'm just kidding. I never actually thought that this is really– that this would really happen. 'Cause I never, ever had heard of you before. And then I saw– and then I saw– It's alright. Damn, dude. I've done a lot of stuff outside of just the show. DroneAddict, I was in a movie called \"The Spy Who Dumped Me\" and I played a guy named Duffer. DroneAddict died. Alright DroneAddict, where are you at? This guy's gonna finish. Uh, oof. This guy's got a pump too. Okay. Oh, come on! Who is this guy? Alright. Someone avenge my death! Hold on. Alright, pysspapa.

Oh, DroneAddict's been dead. I also saw a video about the White House Correspondents' Dinner. What is your favorite episode of the show? I don't know. I really like the labor abuses in the video game industry. 'Cause like, I love gaming and just, like, knowing about all that stuff is really cool. Oh, nice. I also really liked the newest ones about cruises. I liked the mini movie at the end. The like, trailer. That was so much fun. Oh yeah. What the fuck. Damn, SeasickPear just fucking wrecked my ass.

Alright, let's do it. What does it mean to get a win, like, does that means we have to place first, second, and third? Oh, no we're gonna get first. No, we just have to place first. Yeah. Dude, that's really hard. I actually can't believe this is happening. Alright, let's do this. Hasan's all business. Yeah, dude we gotta win. Oh my God. Yeah, dude. DroneAddict, if it wasn't for you, like, we were about to actually just go home. I mean, it's not going. Right now, we're just at the office. This is just our life now. Patriot Act is just our life.

I just opened up Netflix and I see \"The Two Sides of Canada.\" Oh, he's watching right now. Sounds pretty good. Wait, should we tell him to pause it so that the audio isn't ruined. Alright, dude– Alright, dude. Pause it once we get in the game because we've got to win. Okay. Alright. But the episode's funny. Did you come to Ottawa to interview Justin Trudeau? Yeah I came to Ottawa. That's where I live. What?! Dude, yeah. We were just there a couple weeks ago. Nice. Let's not play too aggressive, so let's go to Shifty Shaft.

{"text": "By Neil Biggs\n\nWe're now seeing even traditional \"security\" products such as burglar alarms feature Internet of Things type functionality and, as similar vulnerabilities in these types of products could have serious consequences, we thought we'd take a look.\n\nThe first product we looked at was a Yale smart burglar alarm system which, at the time of purchase, was available through major high street retailers for around £600 and is designed to be installed by the end user. The smart burglar alarm system allows activation and monitoring of the alarm and cameras via a smart phone over the Internet. It also has the option to add smoke detectors to the system. Crucially, it's a secondary security system, in that it monitors but doesn't control access.\n\nThe concept of an easy fit smart alarm system is very appealing as it provides the ability to remotely monitor your home security whilst at work or on holiday. However, from a security standpoint, this feature could open up new attack vectors against a product that owners expect to work when it matters most. With this in mind, we decided to see how secure the product was.\n\nDay 1\n\nThe first thing that we did was to unpack all the items and set them up, although we did disable the external alarm to avoid deafening ourselves! Having set up the device, we started capturing traffic between the mobile application and the control box. This gave us a high level understanding of the systems components and their interactions, as shown in the following diagram:\n\nThe design of the system immediately highlights a number of areas that could be of particular interest:\n\nThe main control box, which communicates wirelessly with the cameras and sensors in the home, as well as being connected to the Internet in order to provide remote activation and monitoring via the corresponding Yale smartphone application\n\nThe communication between the control box and the app running on the mobile phone\n\nThe next step was to capture and analyse the communications taking place. This revealed that the communications with the mobile app were transmitted to a Yale server and used XMPP (XMPP is a simple message protocol based on XML). It's worth highlighting that the XMPP communications between the control box and the Yale server are unencrypted. Some examples of the XMPP traffic can be found below.\n\nThe XMPP commands are sent to and from the control box. They provide status updates and allow for operations such as arming and disarming the alarm. This traffic is interesting as it uses basic authentication (clear text password) and all the requests can be viewed.\n\nThis indicated that the control box was a good candidate for closer inspection. Our next step was a port scan of the central unit, which revealed an internal web user interface running on port 80. On trying to access the page a username and password prompt was displayed:\n\nIf incorrect credentials are submitted an unauthorised page is displayed. Even from this initial page it is clear this is not a polished UI for home use and appears to be more for diagnostics and maintenance. There's no mention of it in the manual, so why is it running? The page titles also give a clue to the likely functionality.\n\nAfter manually entering some common passwords with no success we needed to find a way to get hold of the credentials. We considered brute force, but were keen to get to know the box a little better so we decided to take a more hands on approach.\n\nDay 2\n\nThe next step in trying to get the default credentials was to take a look inside the control box. We identified a 10-pin ARM JTAG header on the bottom left of the control panel. A quick continuity check confirms that the pins on the header are connected to the JTAG pins on the System on Chip (SoC), a Cortex-M4 based Freescale chip. Our hope was that the firmware could be extracted via JTAG so that we could search for the password in the firmware image. The datasheet for the SoC says that it supported read-protection on the JTAG interface.\n\nHowever, no such protection existed, and the firmware was easily extracted. At this point we were about to embark on another IDA Pro adventure, but before getting too deeply involved we ran 'strings' just to see if there was anything interesting. One string in particular stood out - surely this wasn't the password for the web interface? Yes the interface we didn't even try to brute-force against had a password that could be found by simply running strings over the firmware.\n\nNow we had access to the web UI we started playing around with the various options. The device management page had lots of interesting buttons to press and, given we had disabled the large siren, one of our number decided it was safe to press the \"test siren\" button…\n\n… we soon learnt that the control panel also had an internal buzzer that could be very loud in a small space. This was quickly disabled for future tests!\n\nThe page that was of particular interest was the panel control page which has options for arming and disarming the alarm. These were tested and they do indeed activate and deactivate the alarm system. The traffic for these commands was analysed in Wireshark and the specific packets quickly identified.\n\nWe wrote a short python script to login to the web server using the admin credentials and submit the disarm request. This allows for the alarm to be deactivated by simply locating the control box, unplugging the Ethernet cable and directly connecting the laptop running the python script. It is worth noting that when a sensor detects movement and the control box is armed there is a 30 second default time period to allow the user to disarm the system. Once the control box is located it can be disarmed in seconds without any alerts being reported back to the corresponding phone app.\n\nSummary\n\nOur initial assumption that choosing an IoT security product from an established vendor would potentially provide a difficult target was proven to be false. After just a couple of days of analysis we were able to show that within a few seconds of physical access to the control box, the alarm can be disabled trivially.\n\nIn summary the key issues identified were:\n\nRunning the web server on the hub with a fixed username and password\n\nNot enabling the JTAG read protection on the System on Chip\n\nNot encrypting the XMPP traffic from the hub to the Yale servers\n\nDisclosure and comment from Yale\n\nWe first reported our findings to Yale in February 2015, and have been in discussion with them since then. We would like to thank them for their positive response to our findings.\n\nYale released an update to their firmware in July 2015, and also provided us with the following comment:\n\n\"We would like to thank Context IS for the responsible way in which they have carried out their testing and for giving us the opportunity to discuss it in confidence.\n\nWe would certainly agree with Context's point that the \"internet of things\" and connected systems present new challenges, especially in the home market where consumers are not always aware of the potential risks.\n\nOur policy is neither to confirm nor deny any reports about the security of Yale products, as any comment could inadvertently disclose information which might aid criminal activity.\n\nAs one of the most trusted brands in home security, Yale takes product security very seriously and we have a robust, continuous testing and upgrade process.\"\n\nMore details on Context's responsible disclosure policy can be found here.\n\nContact and Follow-Up\n\nNeil leads the Research team and is based in Context's Cheltenham office.

{"text": "Common Causes of Chronic Ankle Instability\n\nMarch 17, 2020\n\nIt is not uncommon to experience instability after spraining your ankle. Wearing a brace and completing a physical therapy program usually prevents instability from becoming a long-term problem. However, sometimes chronic instability is still an issue. The solution to the problem depends mostly on what is causing the instability.\n\nThe symptoms of chronic ankle instability are easy to feel. Most report discomfort on the outside of the ankle that ranges anywhere from a dull ache to sharp stabs. You may also feel as if your ankle wants to roll toward the outside when walking on uneven ground.\n\nAnkle Sprain that Hasn't Healed Properly\n\nA sprain is a soft-tissue injury caused by the ligaments of a joint being stretched or torn. Most ankle sprains are caused by rolling your ankle outward. If you could not treat the sprain right away or if the sprain was severe, it could lead to chronic ankle instability.\n\nRepeated Ankle Sprains\n\nUnfortunately, once you have sprained your ankle once, it is much easier to sprain it again. This is especially true if the original injury has not completely healed yet. With each additional ankle sprain, the chronic instability becomes worse and less likely to improve on its own over time.\n\nCertain Types of Sports\n\nSome sports are more damaging to the ankles than others. For example, ballet dancers and those who participate in gymnastics rely heavily on their feet and ankles to support their weight. Other sports like basketball and football require players to quickly change direction while on the court or field. The ankle joint takes much of the force during these actions.\n\nWhen rest, ice, protective braces and even physical therapy are not enough to alleviate the symptoms of chronic ankle instability, it is time to seek the help of an orthopedic specialist. Ortho Sport & Spine Physicians may be able to reduce or reverse the damage done to your ankles over time.

{"text": "Ray Morehart & the 1927 New York Yankees\n\nChapter 1: Terrill\n\nOne was killed in action in France.\n\nBut brighter days were around the corner. The school celebrated Armistice Day in November, and the end of the war meant the boys would soon be back home from Europe. 1918 was also the first year of enrollment for women, a wise and just decision by AC administration in the face of declining enrollment and activism by women in the community.\n\nThe war years had taken a toll on AC athletic performance. Gone were the legendary football and baseball seasons of 1911-1913, as well as the iconic players who suited up. In 1917, as America mobilized for war, AC football was winless and baseball was struggling. But a turnaround began the following year. That change of fortune coincided with the arrival on campus of one of AC's finest athletes.\n\nTerrill, TX lies just 20 minutes east of Dallas. It's the hometown of actor Jamie Foxx and numerous professional athletes. 100 years ago this spring, it was the home of recent Terrill Tiger athlete and graduate Ray Morehart. In the fall of 1918, he arrived in Sherman to continue his studies and play some ball.\n\nAC football finally ended its losing streak in 1918, notching two victories. Morehart was given running back duties as a freshman, and performed well. He also showed promise in 1919 playing baseball. As the years in Sherman rolled by, it became increasingly clear that his primary talents lay on the diamond.\n\n1919, according to Coach Ewing Freeland, would be the \"comeback year.\" A football star at Vanderbilt before the war, Freeland accepted the vacant coaching job at AC after the war and anxiously began the work of restoring the success of the pre-war years in Sherman. With Morehart moved to quarterback, it wouldn't take long.\n\nThe 1919 Roos notched the first winning season for football since Cecil Grigg's 1913 team. AC posted wins over TCU, UNT, and SE Oklahoma, the last of which saw Morehart throw for three TDs. A 12-10 4th quarter lead over Baylor in Waco was lost on a last minute interception return for a TD; Morehart scored one of the two Roo touchdowns. SMU handed the Roos a lopsided 42-0 defeat, but that loss and the score would not be forgotten in 1920. AC ended the season with a convincing 46-0 win over rival Trinity.\n\nMorehart was shortstop on a 1920 Roo baseball team that split a double header with Rice, topped SMU in a three game series, and played competitively against A&M and Baylor. According to the Chromascope, he was \"fast\" and productive \"with the stick\".\n\nAnticipation was high for football in 1920, as a new post-war class arrived at AC. That team, with Morehart as captain, would be one of the most dominant in Roo history.\n\nChapter 2: Sherman\n\nThe 1920 AC football team was led by what sportswriters referred to as the 'fastest backfield in the state\". This group was comprised of Morehart (who moved from QB to halfback), Lee Jones, and Hub Hollis. The Roos began their 1920 campaign at a new home. Luckett Field (located at the corner of Luckett Street & Lewis Street) was replaced with Cashion Field, which ran east-west at roughly the spot located by Hughey Gym.\n\nThe 1920 Roos were nearly unbeatable. AC captured a TIAA title with a 6-1 conference record, outscoring opponents 330-9. Competitive losses to Baylor and TCU (against whom Morehart ran for a 70-yard TD) were offset by huge wins over SE Oklahoma (62-0), Hendrix (61-0), Southwestern (28-0), and Trinity (21-0). The 42-0 loss to SMU in 1919 was avenged with a 42-0 win over the Mustangs in 1920. Morehart scored late in the game, motivated by a team desire to revenge the prior year's score.\n\nThe highlight of the season was a win against Daniel Baker (now Howard Payne). For four quarters, AC scored at will. Hollis and Jones had multiple TDs each, and Morehart found the end zone five times. His 5 TDs and 30 points remain an all-time AC game record. By the merciful end, the Roos had defeated Daniel Baker by a score of 109-0. Morehart captured All-TIAA halfback honors to go with the 1920 conference title.\n\n1921 AC baseball notched wins over TCU, SMU, Trinity & Rice. Nicknamed \"Egg\" by his teammates, Morehart moved from shortstop to second, a position where he would remain for the rest of his career. The highlight of the season was a 3-0 shutout of the Rice Owls against future major leaguer Eddie Dyer. Morehart's success on the athletic field was so great that he began to receive offers to transfer to larger schools in the Southwest Conference. He rejected them all, remaining loyal to AC until the end. \"I started here and I will finish here, whatever the cost required,\" he told his teammates.\n\nDartmouth's Gene Neely was the new football coach for 1921, and both Morehart and teammate Lee Jones were photographed and featured in the Dallas Morning News. Neely's squad was also previewed in the Austin American Statesman, in an article placed right next to a story about the 1921 baseball season, the New York Yankees, and a recently acquired pitcher named Babe Ruth.\n\nAlthough AC football failed to defend their TIAA championship, the Roos did post another winning season. Another tough loss to Baylor (17-13) also saw another standout game from Morehart; he returned a punt 85 yards for a touchdown. The season included a 17-7 win over SMU at Fair Park Stadium in Dallas. In the game, Morehart did something extraordinary while rushing for a 67-yard TD. From \"Once Upon a Time\" by Roo Football Manager James Creighton:\n\n\"On this play Morehart did something seldom seen on any football field. Half tackled from the back of the helmet, [he] reached up, broke the chin strap, and left his would be tackler with an empty helmet.\"\n\nMorehart finished the 1921 football season, his last, as an All-TIAA halfback once again.\nHis last season of AC baseball began in the spring of 1922. Morehart was Captain, leading his squad to wins against TCU, Texas State, and Trinity. On May 18th, he played his last game at Cashion Field against Hardin-Simmons. After the final out, he walked back to his dorm to meet with a scout from the Pittsburgh Pirates organization. There, on the steps of Luckett Hall, Morehart signed a minor league contract. The kid from Terrill went from Roo to professional after the short walk we Roos have taken hundreds of times.\n\nMorehart was Senior Class President in 1922, and graduated that May. He was awarded the Hoxey Thompson cash prize for \"best all round man\" at Austin College. But it was a different, unique, one-time award that he treasured most.\n\nFrom \"Once Upon a Time\":\n\n\"One last, but sentimental gesture, remained, before the Seniors of 1922 took their departure. For some weeks prior to the end of school, it had been decided that the departure of Raymond Morehart should not be without some material evidence of appreciation. Consequently, a club was formed long before the end of school for the purchase of a large cup which should bear a suitable inscription along with his athletic record.\"\n\n\"On the night of graduation, Morehart was summoned to Room 32 [in Luckett Hall] and there presented with his trophy. At the time Ray could barely stammer his thanks, but later that evening after he had won the Hoxey Thompson prize, he was heard to say anybody could have the money, but the cup……never.\"\n\nChapter 3: Chicago\n\nRay Morehart spent the summer of 1922 with the Flint (MI) Vehicles playing Class B ball in the Michigan-Ontario League. He batted .309 with 356 plate appearances over 94 games. When the season ended, he headed back to Sherman. Gene Neely had left AC, and the head football coach position was open. AC administration decided not to fill the position with one adult, but instead with three kids. The \"Kid Coaches\". Joining Morehart as football coach was former UT football player David Pena and former AC baseball star Charlie Robertson.\n\nBy the fall of 1922, Robertson was already nationally famous. Earlier that spring, the Chicago White Sox ace had accomplished the near impossible by tossing a perfect game against Ty Cobb and the Tigers in Detroit. The major leagues would not see another perfect game until a New York Yankee (Don Larsen) threw one in the 1956 World Series.\n\nUnder the leadership of the Kid Coaches, AC had one of its finest seasons. The Kangaroos repeated their 1920 success by capturing the 1922 TIAA title with a 6-2 record. AC even headed down to Austin and played the UT Longhorns competitively for three quarters, before falling 19-0 at the end. The Longhorns had won all 7 SWC titles since the conference's birth in 1915; they'd win #8 in 1922. The season also included wins over TCU (20-7) and SMU (10-7). For 11 of 12 quarters against SWC foes in 1922, Roo football was arguably the best team in the Southwest.\n\nBy the spring of 1923, Morehart was back in Flint. In 89 games and 350 plate appearances, he had over 100 hits for the second year in a row. He repeated the feat in 1924, notching 112 hits. 27 were for extra bases. It was Morehart's speed and defense however, that caught the eye of big league scouts. His fielding percentage at second base in Michigan consistently led the team. And on the base paths? He was blazing fast. A call up to a higher league was likely just a matter of time.\n\nWhen it came, it was a big one. On August 10th, 1924, the White Sox executed a trade with the Pirates that sent Morehart all the way to the Majors. The Detroit Free Press reported that \"Morehart is considered by critics around the circuit as the best second baseman the league has produced in the six years of its existence.\" The Roo was headed to 14-year old Comiskey Park in Chicago.\n\nMorehart's first game with the White Sox was on an east coast road trip. At Fenway Park on August 13th, he went 0-2 with a walk and stolen base in a 6-0 loss to the Boston Red Sox. In the second game of a double header, Morehart got his first hit (a double) in a 4-1 loss. He finished the 1924 season with appearances in 31 games, 20 hits, 17 walks, and 3 stolen bases. The White Sox finished in the AL cellar, but did include the Roo on a post-season team exhibition tour of Europe.\n\nHe was sent down to the Class A Wichita Izzies for the 1925 season to gain more experience, which worked out well for the Roos. Sherman's proximity to southern Kansas allowed Morehart to assist AC baseball in March. That year in Wichita, he had his best statistical season ever, hitting .330 over 165 games and 655 plate appearances. 54 of his 216 hits were for extra bases; his on base + slugging percentage of .786 led the team.\n\nCharles Comiskey's Player-Manager Eddie Collins was pleased with Morehart's development, and called him back up to the Majors on January 14th, 1926. Collins had been with the White Sox Organization for a decade; while he was present during the infamous \"Black Sox\" scandal of 1919, he had not been implicated in throwing the Series alongside the famous \"eight\".\n\nMorehart was much improved in 1926 for the White Sox, batting .318 over 208 plate appearances in 73 games. His teammate included Longhorn Bibb Falk, against whom the Roos had competed in 1922. AC baseball had also faced C.E. \"Pat\" Olsen and the Aggies in 1922. The Aggie and Longhorn baseball stadiums are named after Olsen & Falk, respectively.\n\nMorehart made the regional press for his utility role as a Collins backup and understudy on August 11th. Later that month on August 31st, 1926, he made national news. That day, he set a major league record that may never be broken.\n\nThe White Sox were in Detroit for a double header against the Tigers, and Morehart woke up that day ready to play ball. From the Chicago Tribune:\n\n\"In the first game, [Morehart] went up to the plate seven times, getting four singles, a double, and being hit once by a pitched ball. Only once was the enemy able to get him out. In the second game, he was at the plate five times, getting three singles, a double, and a base on balls. His batting average for the day was .900, which sounds more like a fielding average.\"\n\nOn August 31st, 1926, Ray Morehart had 9 hits for the Chicago White Sox. The major league record for hits in a double header is 9 (Ray Morehart, shared with 3 others). The major league record for hits in a single game is also 9 (Johnny Burnett, Cleveland Indians, 7/10/1932, in an 18 extra-inning game). Over approximately 25,000 days of major league play spanning three centuries, no batter has ever had more hits on a single day.\n\nMorehart spent the 1926 season in a reserve role, backing up second baseman Collins for most of the year. At season's end, he had established himself in the majors as a valuable utility second baseman.\nAs luck would have it, that's exactly what the 1927 New York Yankees were looking for.\n\nChapter 4: St. Petersburg\n\nCol. Jacob Ruppert's New York Yankees were not even \"New York's team\", let alone an American institution. That honor belonged to John McGraw's New York Giants, who had played in 9 World Series up to 1926. The Giants held spring training in Texas, and played Austin College in the Spring of 1908 & 1909 at Luckett Field on campus. Christy Mathewson pitched, McGraw was umpire, and the Giants beat the Roos both years.\n\nThe home of the Giants was the famous Polo Grounds in Upper Manhattan; the Giants also allowed the Yankees to play there, until Yankees Stadium was completed in 1923. That same year, the Yankees finally won their first World Series title. But none had come since. The 1926 squad made it to the World Series, but lost to the St. Louis Cardinals in seven games.\n\nThe 1927 squad was full of talent. All that was needed was to fill in a few missing pieces of the puzzle. In the winter of 1927, the Yankees were expected to be a great team. By the end of that year, many were already calling them the greatest baseball team ever.\n\nSome of the biggest names in the history of baseball were on the roster of the 1927 Yankees:\n\nBabe Ruth: Right Field. The Sultan of Swat. 714 career home runs.\nEarle Combs: Center Field. Baseball Hall of Fame (HOF).\nBob Meusel: Left Field. 1925 AL home run leader; over 1000 career RBIs.\nMark Koenig: Shortstop. 1,190 lifetime hits over 11 seasons.\nJoe Dugan: Third Base. One of the best defensive basemen of his era.\nTony Lazzeri: Second Base. Baseball HOF.\nLou Gehrig: First Base. The Iron Horse. 2,130 consecutive games.\nPat Collins: Catcher. 10-year veteran of major league baseball.\n\nThe 1927 Yankees would acquire the nickname \"Murderers' Row\" to describe the brutal effectiveness of their batting order. The phrase is usually made in reference to the first six hitters in the order for most of the season:\n\nThe 1927 Yankees were not just about hitting. They had one of the strongest four man pitching rotations in baseball as well:\n\nHerb Pennock: 240 career wins and 1,227 career KOs. Baseball HOF.\nWaite Hoyt: 237 career wins and 1,206 career KOs. Baseball HOF.\nUrban Shocker: 187 career wins and 983 career KOs.\nDutch Ruether: 137 career wins and 708 career KOs.\n\nThe Yankees were managed by Miller Huggins, a veteran player and then manager for a quarter century. The starting lineup for the team was the most solid in the league, but Huggins knew that utility players were key in the event of injury. On January 13th, 1927, the Yankees executed a trade with the White Sox that included future Hall of Famer Leo Durocher being sent to the minors. In the deal, New York acquired utility catcher Johnny Grabowski and utility infielder Ray Morehart. The trade was featured in the Chicago Daily Tribune with Morehart's photo; the Roo was on his way to Yankee Stadium. From Harvey Frommer's book \"Five O'clock Lighting\":\n\n\"It seemed like a minor transaction then, getting backup catcher Grabowski and left handed-hitting utility player Morehart, who had begun his major league career with the White Sox as a 25-year-old in 1924. But Morehart and Grabowski would be two useful supplementary pieces of the 1927 team.\"\n\nThe success of the 1927 Yankees is only partly explained by their talent. Just as important was their hunger. It had been 4 long years since their first Series win in 1923, and the loss to the Cardinals in 1926 left unfinished business. The entire squad was focused on the season with a seriousness that left sportswriters impressed. Even Babe Ruth, famous for his large appetites, showed up to spring training 20 pounds lighter and in the best shape of his life. In 1927, there would be no tomfoolery, not even from the Bambino himself.\n\nThe Yankees spent spring training in St. Petersburg, Florida. Morehart showed promise early; a Florida paper reported that he had \"been doing some neat work with the glove and stick since his acquisition by the Yanks.\" According to the Davenport Daily Times, Babe Ruth had declared that \"All's Well With The Yanks\" thanks in part to the fact that Morehart had \"shown so much in camp.\"\n\"As Ruth Goes, So Go the Yankees\", announced the New Castle News that spring. The paper noted that last year's AL pennant winner had \"added little strength to [the] team since last season.\"\n\nHowever, some rookies looked likely to play key roles. \"It has been intimated rather strongly in the Yankee camp that Ray Morehart, the pride and joy of Terrill, Texas, may do himself a lot of good here. He is being touted as the club's regular second baseman.\"\n\nThe New Castle News hinted that Morehart might start because of the injury prone Mark Koenig. The East Liverpool News did the same. \"You Can Go Fishin' Today, Koenig. [Morehart] May Break into the Yank Infield.\", reported the Ohio paper. The article also criticized the Pirate and White Sox organizations for making the mistake of releasing Morehart, and gave a shout out to the Roo's career at Austin College in Sherman. In late March, the Muncie Sunday Star also brought up the rumors that Morehart might replace Koenig, and published a photo of the Yankee infield (Gehrig-Lazzeri-Koenig-Dugan) with Morehart intruding.\n\nThe team was in fine form in the fine weather, and concluded training with a series of exhibition games against minor league clubs as their train slowly made the trip north to New York. Ruth, Gehrig, and the Yankees were a huge draw. Crowds were immense, and gate receipts for the club were handsome. Ruth especially was a fan favorite, and he soaked up the adoring affection of kids during the trip.\n\nMost of the games were not close, as few clubs could stay with the 1927 Yankees. Their pitching was stellar, and their bats never went quiet. As the Yankees at long last made their way to New York City for two final exhibitions against the Brooklyn Dodgers before Opening Day, Ruth had hit .315 during spring training exhibitions. That average was good enough for second place in the Yankee lineup.\n\nFirst place went to a utility second baseman who hit .373 in 51 at-bats. Ray Morehart.\n\nChapter 5: New York\n\nOpening Day at Yankee Stadium was cold and bleak. Nevertheless, the Yankee bats were hot from the start of the season. Ray Morehart saw his first action in a pinch running role on April 14th at Yankee Stadium, scoring on a sacrifice by Earle Combs. He was inserted into the lineup three times in April. By the end of that month, the Yankees were in first place in the American League.\n\nIn May, Morehart's utility value increased. The Kangaroo saw action in 13 games that month. On May 4th against the Washington Senators, Morehart walked and advanced to third. A Babe Ruth single brought him home in a 7-4 loss.\n\nAmerica was celebrating more than just prosperity and great baseball in 1927. At 7:52 a.m. on Friday, May 20th, the Spirit of St. Louis slowly took off from New York's Roosevelt field headed east. Pilot Charles Lindbergh was attempting to become the first person to successfully navigate a non-stop flight between North America and Europe. The Yankees were in Cleveland that afternoon. While the shores of Newfoundland were disappearing behind Lindbergh, Morehart was sent in to pinch hit in a ninth inning rally that fell short in a 2-1 Yankees loss.\n\nThe Yankees and Indians met again the next day at 1:30 p.m. The game went into extras, and Morehart was put in as a pinch runner in the 11th. The rally failed, Cleveland won it in the 12th, and the game ended at 4:32 p.m. At that very moment, Lindbergh was making his final approach to Le Bourget Aerodrome in France, where an enthusiastic crowd awaited. He touched down 20 minutes later, at 4:52 p.m. (EST) on Saturday, May 21st.\n\nThe success of the 1927 Yankees is actually due to three factors, not two. The talent of the squad was obviously key, as was the commitment and focus of the team. But another detail is often overlooked. With one major exception, the starting lineup and pitching rotation were remarkably free of injury. That exception occurred on May 30th, when shortstop Mark Koenig re-injured his already problematic wrist in the second game of a double header.\n\nAt the time of the injury, the Yankees were in first place with a solid-but-not-yet-historic record. Manager Miller Huggins had to figure out how to replace the injured Koenig, and decided to move Hall of Famer Tony Lazzeri from second base to short stop. Huggins asked Ray Morehart to fill in at second.\n\nThe greatest team in baseball history was asking for help from a Roo. Players looking out from the home dugout in Yankee stadium during the summer of 1927 would see Morehart at second and Gehrig at first, with Babe Ruth between them in the distance in right.\n\nRay Morehart was the starting second baseman for the 1927 Yankees over the next 47 games; the Yankees won 36 of them. At the time of his first start in Philadelphia on May 31st, the Yankee record stood at 27-14 (0.659). After his last start in St. Louis on July 18th, the Yankees had improved their record to an astounding 63-25 (0.716), a winning percentage not far off of their final record of 110-44 (0.714). The Yankees won a ridiculous 77% of their ballgames over that 47 game span.\n\nWith Morehart on Murderer's Row, the team went from great to legendary.\n\nChapter 6: MurderROOS Row, Part 1.\n\nThe Yankees opened a 13-game home stand on June 2nd, and Morehart immediately began to shine as a starter. On June 5th, a diving catch by Morehart and throw to Gehrig turned a double play and ended a threat in a 5-3 Yankees win over Detroit. Three days later on June 8th, he was briefly the toast of New York City. The 1927 Yankees were nicknamed \"Five O'clock Lightning\" due to their late inning dramatics around 5 p.m., and on this day Morehart provided the lightning.\n\nThe Yankees found themselves down 11-6 at home to the second place White Sox in the bottom of the ninth. A dramatic comeback fueled by Ruth, Gehrig, & Lazzeri tied the game at 11 and sent it into extra innings. In the bottom of the 11th, Yankee Cedric Durst led off with a triple. Tony Lazzeri was intentionally walked. With darkness approaching and Yankee fans on their feet, Ray Morehart walked up to the batter's box. He slapped a single to right on the first pitch, and Durst walked home with the winning run.\n\nYankee fans exploded as Ruth, Gehrig, and teammates rushed towards first to celebrate with the Roo. Morehart finished the game with a run, a stolen base, and two hits……including the game winning RBI walk off. \"A winning single from the bat of little Ray Morehart pierced the gathering darkness in Yankee Stadium along about supper-time Wednesday and broke the spell of the season's most exciting ball game,\" screamed the Decatur Herald.\n\nYankee fans barely had time to recover from the excitement when more Roo heroics arrived the next day. With one out and a 4-3 lead in the 7th, Morehart smacked a three run home run to left to put the game away. The Yankee faithful cheers had barely subsided when Babe Ruth followed with a triple to left of his own, after which he would score stealing home. The Yankees won 8-3, and Morehart finished with 3 hits, 3 RBIs, and 2 runs scored. \"Morehart's Homer Gives Yanks Third Win Over Chicago,\" reported the St. Joseph Herald-Press. The Akron Beacon Journal even gave the Roo top billing over the Babe: \"Yanks Take Third Straight from Chicago Team as Morehart, Ruth Star.\" The next day, Huggins moved Morehart to #2 in the order, behind Hall of Famer Earle Combs and ahead of #3 Ruth and #4 Gehrig. Just like that, the 1927 Yankees had become \"MurderROOS Row\".\n\nTwo days later on June 11th, Morehart led off the bottom of the third in a scoreless game against Cleveland. He smashed a double to left, and a wild pitch to Babe Ruth advanced him to third. From that vantage point, he watched as the Sultan of Swat launched a homerun to deep centerfield. Morehart trotted home, and awaited the Babe at home plate to congratulate him. Ruth hit a second home run later in the game. The Babe ended the day with 20 home runs, well on his way to his iconic 1927 record of 60 home runs in a single season. New York won, 6-4.\n\nMorehart had a hit, a walk, and two runs scored in an 8-7 loss to Cleveland the next day on June 12th. Down 2 in the bottom of the ninth, he started a rally with a single, advanced to third after Gehrig reached first on an error, and later scored on a Cedric Durst groundout. But the rally fizzled with two on and two out.\n\nBy mid-June, the importance of Morehart and other reserves was becoming clear. \"Comfortable Position of Yankees Attributed to Fine Reserve Power\", declared The Brooklyn Daily Eagle on June 15th. \"With Mark Koenig on the hospital list, the good work continues with Lazzeri manning shortstop and Ray Morehart cavorting around the keystone territory.\"\n\nThursday, June 16th was Charles Lindbergh Day at Yankee Stadium. The instantly legendary pilot was honored before the game against the St. Louis Browns, and Ray Morehart was in fine form once again. With a 3-0 lead in the bottom of the third, he led off with a single to center. Ruth followed with a single, and Gehrig answered with a single of his own. Utility outfielder Ben Paschal walked into the batter's box with the bases loaded: Gehrig on first, Ruth on second, a Roo on third. Paschal smacked a single to left, scoring Morehart and Ruth. Morehart started the day applauding Lindbergh, and ended it with a sacrifice, a hit, and one run scored in an 8-1 Yankees win.\n\nFriday, June 17th was not Charles Lindbergh Day. But it was Ray Morehart Day again. In the bottom of the 8th with the game tied 2-2, Morehart led off with a single and advanced to third on pitcher Ernie Nevers's throwing error. A Cedric Durst sacrifice brought him home, and the Yankees held on for a 3-2 victory.\n\nThe 13-game home stand came to an end on June 18th against the Browns. Down 2 runs in the bottom of the 1st, Combs hit a single to center and Morehart reached first on a second base error. Gehrig slammed a home run to deep right field, giving the Yankees a 3-2 lead. Up 2 runs in the bottom of the 8th, Morehart reached first again on a single. For the second time that day, he watched from first as Gehrig launched another home run to deep right field. The Yankees won, 8-4. For most of 1927, Ruth and Gehrig were locked in an epic home run battle. Gehrig's bat cooled as summer turned to fall, and the Iron Horse ended with 47 to Ruth's 60.\n\nThe Yankees left the Bronx and headed east towards 15-year old Fenway Park. A Boston Massacre awaited the Red Sox.\n\nChapter 7: MurderROOS Row, Part 2.\n\nNew York headed to Fenway for a double header on June 19th against Boston, but the change in venue did nothing to cool the bat of Morehart. In Game #1, his single in the top of the 1st scored Earle Combs. Babe Ruth followed with a single, advancing Morehart to third. A Lou Gehrig single sent him home. The Yankees defeated the Red Sox in Game #1 by a score of 7-3.\n\nGame #2 began after a break, and the top of the 1st again proved deadly for Boston. Morehart slapped a single to left, and advanced to second on a Babe Ruth walk. Lou Gehrig went opposite field with a homerun over the Green Monster, scoring Morehart and Ruth. The Yankees won, 7-1.\n\nThe Curse of the Bambino began for Boston in 1920, when owner Harry Frazee traded Babe Ruth to fund his musical \"No, No, Nanette\". Ruth might have been the primary reason for the curse, but Ray Morehart wasn't helping to alleviate it. On June 22nd, a Morehart double off of the Green Monster scored Johnny Grabowski from second and extended the Yankees lead to 3-0. New York would hold on for a 3-2 victory.\n\nRed Sox pain continued the next day. On June 23rd, Morehart walked in the top of the 1st. A Ruth sacrifice moved him to second, and a Gehrig single advanced him to third. A Cedric Durst groundout brought him home. The Yankees never lost their lead, and won 11-4. Morehart finished with a hit, walk, and one run scored.\n\nBy late June, a home run race between Ruth and Gehrig was emerging. Gehrig had 21 to Ruth's 24, and the Allentown Morning Call did a piece on the Iron Horse and his attempt to keep pace with the Sultan of Swat. \"Lou Gehrig isn't another Babe Ruth for the reason that there never will be another Ruth. Yet Gehrig is the nearest approach to Ruth that modern baseball knows and doubtless deserves to be rated with the great sluggers of the past.\" The article focused on the difficulty of pitching around Murderer's Row, and even mentioned the role of Morehart. \"Scramble those Yankee hitters any way you will and the result always will be the same – a knotty problem for any pitcher any day in the week. In this connection it is interesting to note the steady mounting of Ray Morehart's batting average. A gain of ninety points [to .240] means that Ray has been slapping the ball forcefully and frequently.\"\n\nBack at Yankee Stadium on June 26th, New York defeated Philadelphia 7-3. Morehart singled, and advanced to second on an error. A Durst single moved him to third, and a Gehrig single brought him home. The next day, Morehart scored from third on a wild pitch to Gehrig after getting on base with a walk. The Yankees won, 6-2.\n\nThe Red Sox were in Yankee Stadium on June 29th, and the curse was in full effect. In the bottom of the 3rd down 2-0, Morehart walked. He scored on a Ruth double to right. The comeback was on, and the Yankees would win 8-2.\n\nIf Boston wanted a reprieve on June 30th, they wouldn't get it. The Yankees closed out June with a 13-6 win over the Red Sox. In the bottom of the 1st, a Morehart single and Ruth walk put runners on first and second. Gehrig crushed a homerun to right, scoring both. In the bottom of the 4th, Morehart singled. From first base, he watched Ruth slug his 25th home run of the season to right field. He jogged home and awaited Ruth at the plate. In the bottom of the 5th, Morehart singled again. From first base, he watched Ruth smash a double to right. This time, Morehart sprinted home, arriving safely. He finished the day with 3 runs and 2 hits.\n\nJune eventually turned to July, but nothing could stop the blistering pace of the Yankees in the summer of 1927.\n\nChapter 8: MurderROOS Row, Part 3.\n\nEvery fan was awake in the city that never sleeps. The Yankees had a record of 52-21 on July 4th, and New Yorkers had the day off. There was really only one thing to do on a bright, sunny Independence Day in Manhattan: watch Murderer's Row do their thing. Amazingly, nearly 73,000 fans crammed into Yankee stadium to see New York take on the Washington Senators in a double header. It was the largest crowd to ever see a baseball game. The Yanks would give the home town fans a lot of reasons to cheer.\n\nAlready down 8-1 to the Yankees, Washington sent in Walter Johnson in the bottom of the 5th for relief. Johnson, in his final year of a 20 season Hall of Fame career, would later be one of the \"first five\" inaugurated in the Baseball Hall of Fame (alongside Ty Cobb, Honus Wagner, Christy Mathewson, and Ruth).\n\nJohnson held the Yankees scoreless for three innings, but Murderer's Row was up in the bottom of the 8th. Combs tripled to center. Ray Morehart doubled, scoring Combs. Ruth singled, scoring Morehart. Gehrig homered. The top of the order hit for the cycle on four at-bats, and the Yankees won Game #1, 12-1. Game #2 would bring more of the same.\n\nMorehart walked in the bottom of the 1st. A Ruth single moved him to third, and a Gehrig double brought him home. He singled in the bottom of the 2nd. A Ruth triple brought him home. Morehart walked in the bottom of the 6th. A Ruth walk loaded the bases, and a Gehrig grand slam home run scored all four. Morehart ended Game #2 with 3 runs and 2 hits. America celebrated its 151st birthday amidst an unprecedented prosperity, and New Yorkers watched their home town team demolish Washington by a score of 21-1.\n\nIt wasn't Independence Day on July 5th, but the Yankee machine rolled on as usual. Morehart singled in the bottom of the 1st, and scored on a Gehrig single. In the bottom of the 3rd, Morehart slammed a triple to left. A Ruth double allowed him to trot home. The Yankees beat the Senators, 7-6.\n\nNew York was at Navin Field in Detroit on July 8th, the site of Roo Charlie Robertson's perfect game five years earlier. Morehart singled to center in the first, scoring Earle Combs. In the second, a Ruth homerun brought him home after yet another single by the Roo. Morehart walked in the 4th, and moved to second on a Ruth walk. A Gehrig single brought him around for yet another run. The Yankees won, 10-8.\n\n\"Yanks Have Qualified as A Really Great Team\", reported the Appleton Post-Crescent in understated fashion. And how so? \"The Yankees showed to those who appreciate things of that sort a flexibility of defense and a store of reserve strength which was delightful to behold. Three of their regular players were out of the game with slight but sufficient injuries. The detraction of three regular players from any team is usually a handicap and a good alibi for defeat. But what happened to the Yankees?\"\n\nThe Post-Crescent detailed the work of Yankee reserves, including Morehart. \"[Huggins] put Ray Morehart at second and Ray drove in the winning run in an eleven inning battle and sewed up another game with a home run.\" The result? \"All of which is recited to show that the Yankees not only have a good ball club, but also that they have as good reserve strength as any team in the league.\n\nJuly 9th brought more Morehart misery to Detroit. The Roo walked in the bottom of the 1st, and a Ruth homerun allowed him to jog home. He reached on a first base error in the fourth, and scored on yet another Ruth home run. Morehart singled in the 7th, and advanced to third on a Ruth double. A Gehrig groundout allowed him to sneak home with a run. Morehart ended the day with 3 runs, 2 walks, and 1 hit. Detroit fell, 19-7.\n\nThe Yankees were in Cleveland on July 12th, and pitched a 7-0 shutout. Morehart doubled home Combs in the top of the 3rd, and later scored on a Gehrig double. He doubled home Grabowski in the top of the 9th, and then casually jogged home after Ruth smacked a home run to deep right field. The Bronx Bombers were behind 3-2 the next day, when Morehart reached on a second base error. A Ruth double to center scored him and tied the game. The Yankees eventually won, 5-3.\n\nNew York finished the Cleveland series with a 10-9 win on July 15th. Morehart doubled in a run in the top of the 5th to tie the game at 3-3, but Cleveland later answered with six runs of their own. Down 9-3 in the 8th, Morehart walked. A Ruth walk moved him to second, and a Gehrig double scored them both. The comeback was on. The Yankees scored 7 runs over the last two innings to take the victory.\n\nThe final series of Ray Morehart's 47-game starting stretch was in St. Louis. The Yankees beat the Browns 5-2 on July 16th. Morehart walked in the top of the 3rd, and a Gehrig single scored him. He singled in the top of the 7th, and a Gehrig double sent him racing to the plate. A 2-1 deficit on July 17th was erased after a Morehart walk in the top of the 6th was followed by a Gehrig walk and Bob Meusel single. He scored from second to tie the game, and the Yankees eventually won 5-4. Morehart started his third and final game on July 18th, a 10-6 victory over the Browns.\n\nAs the Yankees headed to Chicago to take on the White Sox, Mark Koenig was declared 100% healthy and Morehart resumed his utility role. Over the 47 game span, the Yankees had increased their AL pennant lead from 2 games to 12 with a 36-11 (0.766) record. Morehart started 26 of those games at friendly Yankee Stadium, where New York posted a 20-6 record.\n\nAs Morehart's unforgettable summer on Murderer's Row wound down, newspapers across the country reported on \"The Talk of the Town\" from little Sherman, TX. \"Ray Morehart, Reserve Infielder, Has Proven Valuable Cog to Yankees in Race.\"\n\nChapter 9:Texas\n\nMorehart saw action in 12 games after July 18thin his old pinch hitter/runner role.His last game was at Yankee Stadium on September 29th.Morehart slapped a single to right in the bottom of the 8th, Ruth hit home runs #58 and #59, and the Yankees picked up win #108 in a 15-4 defeat of the Senators.The next day, Ruth hit his record breaking 60th home run.\n\nThe season was all but over as summer turned to fall.The Yankees were uncatchable, and stayed healthy for the rest of the year.Their regular season win total of 110 has only rarely been surpassed, and their regular season winning percentage remains the highest ever for a World Series winner.After wrapping up the AL pennant, New York defeated the Pittsburgh Pirates in an uneventful 4 game sweep.Morehart watched all four games from the dugout.\n\nMorehart finished his 1927 Yankees season with a respectable batting average of .256 (the MLB average in 2017 was .254).Over 73 games, he notched 29 walks and 50 hits, including 10 extra base hits.He scored 45 runs, nearly all over the 47 game stretch in which he started.\n\n1927 was the pinnacle for Ray Morehart.Although he had a lot of baseball left to play, the Yankees organization decided to release him after the championship season.The transaction once again involved future Hall of Famer Leo Durocher, who was acquired as an infield replacement for Morehart.Durocher had a 50-year career in major league baseball as a player and manager, retiring as skipper of a 1973 Houston Astros team that included Cesar Cedeno & J.R. Richard.\n\nThe release of Morehart caused a good deal of head scratching around the country:\n\nThe Allentown Morning Call:\n\n\"About Morehart:Ball fans never will understand why competent players are waived out of the league and when other clubs need them.It is all Greek to the fans and the owners never make any effort to clear it up.With the passing of Ray Morehart to the minors, the question comes up again:Why did they let him out?While Morehart operated at second for the Yankees they hung up 37 victories and 11 defeats.That was the greatest pace of the campaign, and Morehart certainly did not slow down the Yankees.\"\n\nThe Brooklyn Daily Eagle:\n\n\"Why do club owners and baseball managers allow a player of the caliber of Ray Morehart to be waived out of the big leagues?We have watched Morehart in a number of games and he always impressed us favorably.We liked his spirit for one thing.Gee, how he likes to play baseball!We'd take a chance on a youngster with fighting spirit, speed, a fair hitter, a good fielder, and one who thinks it part of the day's work to give the fans a dollar's worth of effort for every 50 cents he is paid.\"\n\nFrustrated and determined to make the majors again, Morehart signed with the AA St. Paul (MN) Saints in 1928.There, he had one of his best seasons ever, batting .311 with 203 hits and 56 walks.He also recorded 42 stolen bases. But despite his best efforts, Morehart never played in the majors again.He spent two seasons with St. Paul, the 1930 season with the Columbus Senators, and 1931 with the Toronto Maple Leafs.He finished his career in 1933 with the Class A Dallas Steers.\n\nWhen Morehart learned that legendary Roo Coach Cecil Grigg was leaving AC for Rice after the 1932 season, he retired from baseball and accepted the head football coaching job in Sherman.The Great Depression was wreaking havoc on the health of Austin College and Roo athletics that year, just as WW1 had done when Morehart arrived on campus in 1918.The prosperity days of New York in 1927 were gone, and the Roo had come full circle.\"Former Yank to Coach Austin College,\" declared the Abilene Morning News.\n\nMorehart eventually left his playing and coaching days behind.He moved to Dallas, started a family, and built a career in business that lasted for decades.\n\nIn 1927, Morehart had gone to New York.Late in his life in 1987, New York came to him.\n\nThe Yankees came to Arlington Stadium that summer to face the Texas Rangers, and nobody could stop New York first baseman Don Mattingly.He had hit 5 home runs in 5 straight games, and was looking to extend the streak.With the bases loaded, Mattingly launched a Charlie Hough knuckleball into the right field stands, making it six straight games.The home run was Mattingly's fourth grand slam of the season, tying a major league baseball record held by former first baseman and Yankee legend Lou Gehrig.\n\nAnd 87-year old Ray Morehart watched the Mattingly blast from the stands.\n\nThe Austin American Statesman caught up with Morehart that evening and got his thoughts on the Yankees and their first baseman:\n\n\"The second baseman of the New York Yankees, explaining the power of the first baseman, said 'he told me the reason he had power was his mother was a good cook.He said he was eating fish out of the Hudson river.I told him, 'you better be careful.There's garbage in that river.'He said his mother cooked it real good.'\"\n\n\"Willie Randolph talking about Don Mattingly?It's Ray Morehart talking about Lou Gehrig.They were teammates 60 years ago on the team many consider the greatest ever, the 1927 Yankees.Morehart backed up Tony Lazzeri at second base.Morehart, a native Texan, was in the stands at Arlington when Mattingly hit his fourth grand slam of the year.\"\n\nMembers of the 1927 Yankees slowly began to leave us as the years passed.The most famous was Lou Gehrig.The first baseman contracted ALS (Lou Gehrig's disease), which ended his consecutive games played streak at 2,130 in 1939, forced his retirement, and took his life in 1941.Before it did, Gehrig gave us one of baseball's iconic moments.At his farewell ceremony on July 4, 1939, the dying man told the country that \"I consider myself the luckiest man on the face of the earth.\"\n\nIn January 1989, two years after Mattingly's blast in Arlington, your humble author was a freshman at Austin College living in Luckett Hall and just about to friend the many AC baseball players who would form a core of his Austin College experience.Snow arrived in north Texas that month, a novel experience for me, a south Texas boy.That same month, AC baseball legend Ray Morehart passed away in Dallas.He was one of the last surviving players from the 1927 team.With his passing, only Mark Koenig remained, the shortstop whom Morehart had replaced for 47 glorious games during the summer of 1927.\n\n2018 marks the 100-year anniversary of many noteworthy events on campus.Armistice day was celebrated after a brutal four years of war.Women fought and won the right to enroll as students at AC.Amidst all of this change, Austin College Kangaroo Ray Morehart showed up on campus and began to prepare for his role as part of the greatest baseball team of all time.\n\nRay Morehart went head-to-head against the Longhorns and Bibb Falk in Austin.He also competed against the Aggies and C. E. \"Pat\" Olsen in College Station.The fields used today by Texas & Texas A&M are named for Falk & Olsen, respectively.\n\nRoo baseball has played at Baker Field in Sherman since 1974.Maybe it's time to honor this particular Kangaroo.I dunno about you, but \"Baker Field at Morehart Park\" certainly has a nice ring to it.

Mindfulness is the energy that knows what is happening in the present moment. And here are 2 powerful mindfulness exercises. Although mindfulness has become very popular in recent years, the word may seem a bit abstract and confusing to some people. It often sounds like a kind of challenging practice that is only for the select few.\n\nThe practice of mindfulness is very simple. You stop, you breathe, and you still your mind.\nYou come home to yourself so that you can enjoy the here and now in every moment.\n\nMindfulness is the energy that knows what is happening in the present moment. And here are 2 powerful mindfulness exercises.\n\nMindfulness is the energy that knows what is happening in the present moment. Mindfulness allows us to recognize strong emotions and prevent them from dominating us.\n\nOur minds can be difficult to study from a scientific perspective. One tip, tool, exercise, or 'hack' may work for one person, but not work for 99% of other people. Does that mean it doesn't work? Or it only works sometimes? Our minds are highly individualized and contextual like that. Ultimately, you have to pay attention to what works best for *you* in particular.— Steven Handel\n\nHere are 2 powerful mindfulness exercises, they will help you fast!\n\n2 Powerful Mindfulness Exercises You Must Try\n\nExercise number 1 – return to our senses\n\nModern lifestyles impose many obligations and bring us innumerable information, so we often feel overwhelmed and distracted. Mindfulness allows us to step out of the preoccupation of the mental sphere at least for a moment and to return back, here and now, using what is always available to us – our body, our senses, and our breath.\n\nMake sense and listen to sounds; In doing so, do not try to determine what produces them and do not judge them as pleasant or unpleasant.\n\nThen focus on the colors and shapes you see around you.\n\nLook at them as if you were seeing them for the first time in your life.\n\nFocus curious attention on the scents around you.\n\nHere is a new spiritual practice for you: don't take your thoughts so seriously. — Eckhart Tolle\n\nExercise number 2 – Conscious Breathing\n\nWhen someone is very upset, they will often get the advice, \"Just breathe deeply!\" In addition to keeping us alive, the breath can help calm our troubled mind and connect with the present moment.\n\nWe can practice this exercise anytime and however long we want. We can take even just one minute to feel effective.\n\nStop for a moment and close your eyes if you wish.\n\nMake your breathing aware: is it shallow, fast, deep, slow?\n\nCuriously and patiently monitor your breathing sensations (such as expanding and lowering your abdomen and chest) for a while without changing them.\n\nNotice if your attention is distracted by your thoughts, then return it slightly to your breath.\n\nThen take a deep breath and exhale several times and continue your day.\n\nTake some time to be mindful today! Maybe when you're in the shower, focus on the feeling of the warm water on your skin, the smell of the soap, your fingers massaging your scalp.\n\nMaybe when you've just gotten into bed, focus on the warmth of the sheets, the softness of the pillows, the weight of your body against the mattress. If you have a pet, spend some time with them concentrating solely on the experience – for example, if you have a cat, concentrate on the warmth and softness of their fur (if your pet is fluffy) or the sound and vibration of their purring.\n\nTaking some time to be present at the moment can be a really relaxing, healing thing.", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "2ff0eedb-01df-45a7-b7f4-3912e77fd560", "url": "https://positiveaffirmationscenter.com/2-powerful-mindfulness-exercises-you-must-try/"}

{"text": "World Sleep Day, March 13, 2020!\n\nWorld Sleep Day is intended to advance sleep health worldwide. The mission involves all professions involved in the health and well being of the world's population. This involves education of the healthcare professionals and patients as well. Our mission as well as our vision is to promote the role of the dentist in an effort to help patients achieve better health through better sleep. How can the Dentist impact better sleep? There are many ways that involve:\n\nEducating the Dentist about how to recognize someone at risk for a sleep disorder – primarily sleep apnea and snoring\n\nEducating patients about the various health related consequences associated with poor sleep and sleep disorders – these include both medical and dental conditions such as Diabetes, Cardiovascular Disease, High Blood Pressure and even Periodontal (Gum) Disease\n\nAssisting people with obtaining a diagnosis of their sleep disorder\n\nFacilitating the management of the sleep disorder and in the case of sleep apnea and snoring a Dentist will use an oral device or appliance that repositions the lower jaw and supports the airway for improved quiet breathing\n\nProviding ongoing communication with physicians regarding the care of the patient\n\nAnd most of all an improved Quality of Life through an improved Quality of Sleep\n\nOverall the goal is to spread the word about the importance of sleep to Dentists and patients through education and enlightenment.\n\nOral Devices for Snoring and Sleep Apnea\n\nOral Devices (Oral Appliances) reposition the lower jaw, opening the airway and stabilizing both the jaw and tongue, thus preventing the lower jaw and tongue from collapsing back during sleep. This helps stabilize the breathing, opens the airway (see circle) and prevents airway collapse. This in turn lessens and may even resolve the apnea and as an added bonus reduces or eliminates snoring.\n\nAdvantages of Oral Devices\n\nThere is a growing body of scientific literature that has demonstrated the overall effectiveness of Oral Appliances for the management of snoring in the absence of sleep apnea, for mild to moderate sleep apnea as an option and for people who are unable to tolerate the CPAP device. The major advantages of an Oral Appliance:\n\nPeople tolerate them well and as such will use them for more hours per night and more nights per week or month\n\nBecause they are used for longer periods of time the overall effectiveness is equivalent to CPAP – this applies to health concerns such as blood pressure and Diabetes type II\n\nThese devices have been shown to provide positive long-term outcomes\n\nThey are minimally cumbersome and as such are comfortable\n\nThe devices are easily transported (easy to travel with)\n\nRequire minimal care and maintenance\n\nOral Appliances are best provided by a Dentist who has been adequately educated and trained in sleep medicine, as well as in the use of a variety of oral appliances and especially trained to address any negative outcomes (side effects) that may occur.\n\nHow will you help to raise awareness of sleep and sleep-related breathing disorders on World Sleep Day this year?

{"text": "1 Answer\n1\n\nWhile I have no experience with this, I am pretty confident that it is not practical to age wort prior to fermentation in any container that is not fully sterile (not just sanitized). I imagine it would be safe to age wort if you pressure can it.\n\nWhen we make wort, we are creating the perfect conditions for growing yeast (and lots of other microbes). Something will grow in the wort and start fermentation in your barrel.\n\nBottle bombs are bad - can you imagine a barrel bomb?\n\nI would also question what chemistry you are trying to achieve by aging wort. Compared to the chemical profile following fermentation, wort is relatively simple - it is the yeast during fermentation that makes beer really interesting. If you are looking to add the character of the wood in the barrels (or the prior occupant of the barrel), then this is safer to do following fermentation.\n\nThere are lots of examples of using wood/barrels, both new and used, in making some specialty beers. However, I believe that these all use the wood post-fermentation.\n\nLots of beer styles benefit from some aging.

{"text": "increases immunity, reduces the likelihood of complications for flu and colds,\n\none of the key antioxidants for the human body.\n\nDaily Needs\n\nThe human need for vitamin C is strictly individual and is determined by:\n\nage,\n\nsex,\n\nactivities,\n\nclimatic conditions,\n\nbad habits.\n\nImportant is the amount of vitamin consumed during pregnancy and lactation.\n\nA person especially needs vitamin C for flu, colds, stress, fever and against the background of toxic effects.\n\nUnder conditions of extreme temperatures or staying in the northern or southern climate, a person should take 30-50% more vitamin C. The younger the person, the better his body absorbs vitamins, so the need for these substances in the elderly is much higher.\n\nIt has already been proven that taking oral contraceptives reduces the level of vitamin C in the body, so the daily dose should be increased.\n\nAverage daily doses:\n\nphysiological norm: 60-100 mg.\n\nTherapeutic dose daily: 500-1500 mg.\n\nDosage of vitamin C per day can be divided into several parts and taken throughout the day.\n\nAs you know, the human body quickly spends incoming vitamin C, so you should constantly maintain its concentration.\n\nAscorbic acid for colds and flu\n\nVitamin C has become a common preventive and curative remedy for colds since the 1970s. During this period, the work of Dr. Pauling gained popularity.\n\nIn those years, Nobel laureate Pauling advised vitamin C for colds to consume 1000 mg daily. In the same amount, the scientist recommended using the substance for the prevention and improvement of general well-being.\n\nAn international non-profit organization that studies the effectiveness of medicines, the Cochrane Collaboration, reported that, according to the results recently conducted a meta-analysis of 30 studies, daily (200 mg or more) intake of vitamin C for flu and cold helps reduce symptoms and reduce the duration disease.\n\nIn addition, the studies provided an opportunity to learn that with daily intake of vitamin C, the likelihood of a cold is reduced by 50%. These results are especially important for the following people:\n\nThe human body needs ascorbic acid more often than in other vitamins. This is due to the fact that with flu and cold, vitamin C creates an acidic environment in the body in which viruses can not fully exist.\n\nFor preventive purposes, doses of 5 mg (3-4 tablets) per day are used. With flu and cold, a shock dose of ascorbic acid - 1 mg, that is, 20 tablets per day is indicated.\n\nContents in food products\n\nAscorbic acid in large quantities is found in such types of products:\n\ncitrus fruits,\n\nvegetables,\n\nleaf vegetation.\n\nVitamin C is contained in:\n\nmelon,\n\ndifferent types of cabbage,\n\nBulgarian pepper,\n\napples,\n\ntomatoes,\n\nbaked in the \"uniform\" potatoes,\n\napricots,\n\npeaches,\n\nstrawberries,\n\nblack currant.\n\nAscorbic acid for colds can also enter the patient through animal products, such as the liver and kidneys.\n\nTo fill the missing substances for cold and flu, you can also eat sorrel, and drink broth from the hips, but vitamins for colds are an unquestionable part of complex treatment.\n\nIndications and contraindications\n\nAs an additional therapy, ascorbic acid is indispensable in hypo- and avitaminosis. A high demand for vitamin C occurs when:\n\nactive growth of the body,\n\npregnancy and lactation,\n\nincreased physical stress,\n\nduring recovery from a serious illness,\n\nin the winter season, when there is a high risk of contracting infectious diseases,\n\nwith intoxication.\n\nLimiting the intake of vitamin C is necessary for people who are hypersensitive to ascorbic acid. Video in this article will tell in detail about the phenomenon of vitamin C.\n\nstopgripp.ru\n\nVitamins for flu and cold: a list of effective vitamins\n\nAs soon as autumn begins, many of our compatriots immediately begin to suffer from a decline in strength, a cold.\n\nIf the weather is damp, viruses are activated, provoking the development of acute respiratory infections and flu.\n\nIn order not to be ill, you should systematically maintain your immune system with vitamins. Even if a person is already sick, taking vitamin complexes will greatly accelerate the process of recovery.\n\nHow do vitamins work?\n\nThanks to the use of higher doses of vitamin C at the very beginning of the disease, you can reduce the risk of its further aggravation and the development of complications. Ascorbic acid stimulates the ability of the human body to secrete leukocytes and interferons.\n\nIt is possible to create an acidic environment, detrimental to the activity of viruses, to prevent the penetration of their particles into cells.\n\nVitamin C is often included in the composition of popular combination antiviral medicines. Saturate the body with ascorbic can, if you eat vegetables, berries and fruits, extraordinarily rich in this vitamin:\n\nsweet Bulgarian pepper;\n\ncitrus;\n\nkiwi;\n\nblack currant;\n\ncranberries;\n\ninfusions, decoctions of rose hips.\n\nCoping with colds will help vitamin A, several times enhancing the protective function of the mucous membranes. This prevents the virus from entering the cells, increasing the activity of interferon. You can get vitamin A from fatty fish, butter and liver of animals.\n\nScientific research has shown that under the condition of preventive use of vitamin D, the susceptibility of the body to respiratory ailments can be reduced, and diseases of the upper respiratory tract can be reduced. Another important feature is the prevention of resistance to antibiotics.\n\nImportant for influenza, cold and mineral substances, for example, zinc. It is characterized by antioxidant properties, blocks the destruction of cell membranes, the ability of rhinoviruses to multiply. Due zinc activates the activity of the protein of the immune system, the symptomatology of the disease softens. The substance is present in nuts, seeds, beans.\n\nTake vitamins should be in higher dosages, because they are quickly washed away with a plentiful drink.\n\nVitamin Complexes\n\nModern pharmacology offers just a huge selection of vitamin preparations. Vitamins for colds should be chosen such:\n\nWill direct. This special complex contains vitamin A, ascorbic acid, zinc and natural extracts of plants. It increases resistance to viruses during the exacerbation of seasonal diseases, will accelerate the process of recovery from influenza. It is recommended to take 1-3 tablets a day;\n\nvitamin C (effervescent). Convenient in use, produced in a dose of 1000 mg. You can drink it once a day;\n\nTeraflu Immuno. It consists of ascorbic acid, zinc, extract of echinacea. Produced in the form of a powder that does not provide for preliminary dissolution (it should be poured immediately into the mouth). Effectively prevents colds and can be prescribed to relieve it;\n\nMulti-tabs Immuno Plus. The complex helps to strengthen the body and will become an excellent preventive measure of viral diseases. It contains lactic acid bacteria, which are responsible for stimulating the production of immunoglobulins. You can take it once a day for a month;\n\nSambucol Immuno forte. This biological supplement is made of zinc, vitamin C, black elderberry extract. The latter component increases immunity, protects cells from viruses, and is characterized by anti-inflammatory action. Produce it in the form of a solution, which is useful to add in teas to obtain a therapeutic drink. It is also provided for mixing it with mineral water for a refreshing drink. Allowed to give to children who are older than 6 years.\n\nWhat will help people's ways?\n\nOrganically complement the treatment and alternative medicine. Folk remedies are good at curing colds, they are effective for flu, but on the condition of a competent approach, and in parallel, it is necessary to clarify which antibiotics to take when taking Orvi and the flu\n\nSo, it is very useful during the illness to drink plenty of fluids. It can be not just water, but also vitamins rich in fruit juices, fruit and black currant kissels, cranberries, cranberries, herbal teas. Drinks quench a constant thirst caused by high body temperature, saturate the patient's body with the necessary substances.\n\nAgainst the cold will help the vitamin composition, made from natural butter and boiled milk. The resulting mixture is drunk 6 times a day.\n\nPerhaps, the economical option of treatment will be the use of lemons. They should be ground with a meat grinder, season with 150 g of sugar or 100 g of honey. Use this homemade medicine should be 5-6 times a day for 1 tablespoon.\n\nIf you include effective vitamins in your food, then with the flu and during the cold they will become the key to a quick recovery. Pay attention to:\n\ngarlic. Phytoncids kill microbes, viruses, not allowing them to multiply. Garlic can be used for inhalation;\n\nblack currant.

You can use raspberries in any form;\n\nIn order not to ache, it is necessary to saturate the body with vitamins not only during seasonal diseases, but also throughout the year, as the expert in the video in this article authoritatively tells.\n\nstopgripp.ru\n\nVitamin C and cold treatment\n\nAt the first signs of a cold, many people are after vitamin C with supplements. For a long time it was thought that vitamin C very well helps to cure a cold. Then there were studies in which it was said that vitamin C for the treatment of colds is harmful. Some doctors say that vitamin C does not affect the common cold at all. In what the truth?\n\nWhat is vitamin C?\n\nVitamin C was first recommended for colds in 1970. But, despite its widespread use, experts say that there is very little evidence that vitamin C really affects the treatment of colds.\n\nVitamin C is a vitamin and an antioxidant that the body uses to make you strong and healthy. Vitamin C is used to support the condition of bones, muscles and blood vessels. Vitamin C also promotes the formation of collagen and helps the body absorb iron.\n\nVitamin C is found in vegetables and fruits, especially oranges and other citrus fruits. This vitamin is also available as a natural nutritional supplement in the form of chewable tablets or other forms.\n\nVitamin C is very good for preventing colds, so we strive to take it in large quantities with foods such as vitaminized juices, teas and fruits.\n\nCan vitamin C prevent or treat symptoms of a cold?\n\nVitamin C has been studied for many years as a possible treatment for the common cold or as a way to prevent colds. But the results were contradictory. In general, experts almost did not find the benefit of vitamin C in the prevention or treatment of colds.\n\nIn July 2007 the researchers wanted to find out if taking 200 mg or more of vitamin C per day could reduce the frequency, duration and severity of the common cold. After 60 years of clinical research, they found that vitamin C supplements almost do not make the cold less or shorter in duration. If vitamin C is taken daily, the duration of the common cold can be reduced by 8% in adults and 14% in children.\n\nBut the researchers found that vitamin C has the greatest impact on people who are in extreme conditions, for example, marathon runners. In this group, taking vitamin C reduces the risk of catching a cold twice.\n\nSo, what does all this mean?\n\nThe average adult who suffers from a cold for 12 days a year will suffer from it 11 days a year, if this person received high doses every day during the year vitamin C.\n\nFor an average child who suffers about 28 days a year from a cold, this means that daily intake of high doses of vitamin C will shorten the duration of the cold to 24 days per year.\n\nWhen vitamin C was tested for cold treatment in 7 separate studies, it was found that vitamin C for cold treatment is no more effective than placebo.\n\nIs vitamin C safe?\n\nVitamin C can be taken with confidence with sources such as fruits and vegetables. For most people taking vitamin C in recommended amounts, it is safe. The recommended daily allowance is 90 mg for men and 75 mg for women. High doses of vitamin C (more than 2000 mg per day for adults) can cause complications such as kidney stones, nausea and diarrhea.\n\nTaking more than 500 mg of vitamin C at one time will not do any good, because the body can not keep it. In addition, anyone with kidney disease should avoid vitamin C with supplements. If you can not decide on the doses of vitamin C for colds, talk with your doctor.\n\nThe greatest benefit from the increased amount of vitamin C is obtained by people with vitamin C deficiency, as well as highly qualified athletes and military personnel. Studies conducted with groups of athletes and military personnel who are in very good physical form and experience in extreme conditions, showed that taking vitamin C reduces the risk colds by 50%. However, these results were not known to the general public.\n\nVitamin C for immunity against colds\n\nIf you want to take vitamin C to help your immune system, it's best to get it with foods instead of supplements. Foods high in vitamin C include:\n\nCitrus fruits and juices\n\nGreen and red pepper\n\nStrawberry\n\nTomatoes\n\nBroccoli\n\nDark green\n\nSweet potatoes and white\n\nCantaloupe\n\nRaspberries, blueberries and cranberries\n\nWatermelon\n\nBrussels sprouts\n\nA pineapple\n\nCabbage\n\nSo, whether to use vitamin C in the treatment of colds, it's up to you and your doctor. In any case, the intake of fruits and vegetables, as well as vitamin supplements during the cold season, will add to you health, and your immune system - sustainability.\n\nilive.com.ua\n\nAntiviral means of fast action\n\nColds can overtake each of us when it is completely unacceptable to get sick.

{"text": "Spring is the season of warm sunlight, but there's a big temperature gap between daytime and nighttime. When spring arrives, nature's power withdrawn during the winter awakens and emits its force. If you don't manage your health properly at this time of the year, your body could lose its natural balance. As a result, the immune system will weaken and your health will suffer. We have to pay particular attention to our health, especially in spring. Here are some tips for better health care: 1. Get enough sleep. The best way of relieving fatigue in spring is to sleep well. If you didn't have enough sleep, taking a 20 minute nap in the afternoon will help relieve fatigue. However, taking a nap for over half an hour could result in a bad sleep. Sleeping all day to get rid of fatigue accumulated on weekdays during holidays could also make us even more tired the next day. To sleep well, try to avoid caffeinated drinks and alcohol. 2. Do stretching in the morning and evening. Relaxing tense muscles through free exercises and light stretching is recommended. Especially, briefly warming up by stretching after getting up in the morning will make you start a day with vigor. Slightly exercising before going to bed can help you sleep well and thus can prevent spring fever. 3. Maintain cleanliness. During spring, it's easy to get eye and respiratory diseases due to yellow dust. You should avoid rubbing your eyes. Make it a habit to wash your hands frequently after coming home and even when indoors. After returning home, eyes and nose should also be washed clean. Also, don't forget to drink enough water to keep enough moisture in your body.\n\n4. Get enough sunlight exposure. As sunshine increases, the secretion of pituitary hormone also increases. More vitamin D is also generated in our bodies and our bones also get stronger. The secretion of hormone also becomes active. Getting enough sunlight during spring, the season of more sunlight, is also good for our health.", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "6b770bee-186e-44ed-b2f9-d35711a9789f", "url": "http://journal.changwon.ac.kr/news/articleView.html?idxno=4032280"}
{"text": "Smyles, who retired from the profession in 2005 after teaching at Lakeview Public Schools for 27 years, completed the first of her \"Michigan History Nightmares\" series in 2014. There are four volumes and six books in total, with the first two volumes each containing two books.\n\nAfter temporarily being a substitute teacher post-retirement and between 2010, the Clinton Township resident developed a desire to pursue writing that in a way would be engaging to youth. She said that when she was a teacher, it didn't always bring much fulfillment teaching it out of the textbook \"because it was dry.\"\n\nInstead, she decided to go back through the history curriculum to see what was being taught and devised creative ways to make the content more engaging. And the focus was to get local students to better understand the history of Michigan.\n\n\"It would be learning but in a fun way, and they'd be more apt to learn about their state,\" Smyles said.\n\nHer first volume includes the books \"Trapped in the Lower Peninsula\" and \"A Narrow Escape in the Upper Peninsula.\" A special pen and a normal day at school goes haywire as friends are thrust into an adventure and suddenly embark on a historic journey of the state's Lower Peninsula.\n\nThe second volume, with the books \"Entombed in a Hopewell Burial Mound\" and \"A Shocking Encounter with the Iroquois and Three Fires Native American Tribes,\" takes the youthful group back into time to explore Michigan's Native American culture, including the ancient Hopewellian mound builders, Ojibwas, Ottawas and Hurons.\n\nVolume three, \"Michigan Fur Trade … A Hare Raising Adventure,\" is Halloween-centric and leads the kids into contact with pirates, bears and wild rapids. Volume four, \"How Michigan Became a State—Lessons From Beyond the Grave,\" is the last installment published in 2018 and transports students through mysterious USB ports and catapults them back into time to deal with ghosts, quicksand and even cannonballs. They need to find a way home.\n\nSmyles took her books to different school assemblies and craft shows. She even tweaked her presentations to make them more interactive.\n\nAfter the pandemic started she looked into other ways to get her series known, so she traveled to the west side of the state — to bookstores in Pentwater, Traverse City, Grand Haven, where she was able to sell numerous sets of her books to a new audience.\n\nShe has also created her own YouTube videos, one for each volume, in attempts to inspire at-home learning for both teachers and students.", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "c13ded9f-3aec-4831-bae0-54b7be9df55e", "url": "https://www.candgnews.com/index.php/news/former-teacherturnedauthor-puts-spin-on-history-118223"}
{"text": "Blog may complicate and lengthen proceedings.\n\nPrenups are certainly not the answer to everything. Particularly in a case as complex as the Bezos split. But these agreements, recognised in every US state, do often simplify division of assets following divorce.\n\nARE PRENUPS ENFORCEABLE?\n\nWhat about the UK? We've written about the legality of prenups in this country before and the law is developing all the time. Generally speaking if the agreement is 'fair' courts will rely on it. But it's the definition of 'fair' that could add an element of uncertainty to any prenuptial agreement you sign. For example:\n\nDid each party receive independent legal advice?\n\nWas there full disclosure of each side's financial position?\n\nWhen was the agreement signed? Ideally any prenup should be executed at least two months ahead of marriage to avoid any suggestion that undue pressure was applied to the financially weaker spouse.\n\nBecause a prenup involves altering the rights you may have under the general law it's essential to seek advice from an experienced family solicitor before entering any agreement.\n\nINTERNATIONAL DIVORCE AND PRENUPS\n\nAt Brookman in London we advise regularly on international divorce. Often there will be a prenup in place. Enforceability can become a matter of contention. Questions that may arise include:\n\nCan UK courts enforce a prenup signed abroad?\n\nAre foreign assets covered by the prenup?\n\nEverything depends on what the original agreement says about jurisdiction and the law that governs the agreement. The recent case of DB v PB (2016) showed that the courts in England and Wales will uphold jurisdiction clauses even where it might be unfair to the financially weaker spouse to do so.\n\nThe case involved a Swedish couple that had signed three prenuptial agreements. Each agreement provided that it should be interpreted according to the law of Sweden and that any maintenance claims should be heard by Swedish courts. The wife issued proceedings in England but the judge found that because of the prenup, his hands were tied. While he could order the sale of the family home, that was all he could do. Even though he was 'completely satisfied' that the wife's needs would not be met by the sale of the home alone. Any other order would mean straying into the area of maintenance and the needs of the wife and children – which the prenup did not allow. He was obliged to respect the parties' autonomy.\n\nCAN I CHANGE A PRENUP?\n\nAs we have seen above the overriding concern of the courts when looking at a prenup governed by English law is to decide whether it's fair or not. As the length of a marriage increases, circumstances change. Marital wealth may increase or diminish significantly (Jeff Bezos hadn't even started Amazon when he married). There may be children. What was fair on the day you married may not be fair a few years down the line.\n\nCourts will always bear in mind the parties' freedom to enter a prenup. But when a long marriage ends, the greater the onus will be on the person seeking to rely on a prenup to establish that it remains fair.\n\nFor this reason we recommend you review your prenup every four or five years or when a significant life event occurs. This will involve a deed of variation or a postnuptial agreement.\n\nHOW DO I DISCUSS A PRENUP WITH MY PARTNER?\n\nIn our experience some people can feel awkward about bringing up the idea of a prenuptial agreement with their partner. They are uncomfortable discussing what might happen to finances and property if the marriage fails. And this is understandable. But it helps if:\n\nYou raise the idea of a prenup as early as possible\n\nYou point out that it will be designed to protect the financially weaker party\n\nIt can make any divorce less complicated and less expensive\n\nYou suggest preparing the initial agreement together\n\nThere's no getting round the fact that a discussion about prenups can be delicate. But at Brookman it's our job to sensitively guide you through the process. Remember, we will be working with your partner's own legal adviser. It's typically a requirement that both of you receive independent advice.

Deciding what to feed them, and how much, can be difficult to determine. It would be ideal to keep your horses on pristine pastures year round where they could eat grass all day long, but the climate in America rarely allows for that. The good news is that when you utilize horse hay properly, it can be just as good as a grass based diet.\n\nNovember 1st, 2016 - SEOTERIC\n\nAll horse owners know that the way they feed their horse is extremely important to their animal's overall health and condition. However, horse owners sometimes need help figuring out exactly how much hay their horse should consume in a day. Horses that are more active will require more hay than those that are idle.

Unfortunately, the way horses are typically fed is greatly affected by the desire to rush through a busy schedule. Instead, as a horse owner, the nutritional needs of your horses should be a top priority 8th, 2016 - SEOTERIC\n\nTo find the right hay for your horse, you should know about their health. A horse's stomach is small, with a normal sized small intestine and a large hindgut. These body structures enable your horse to graze continuously rather than having one or two large meals a day.\n\nMay 27th, 2016 - SEOTERIC\n\nHorses have different dietary restrictions and needs depending upon their use and purpose. Growing horses need more protein while work horses need a balance of nutrients. These animals can succumb to digestive problems if they eat the wrong diet. Horses are also big eaters, able to consume between 2 and 2.5 percent of their body weight in a day.\n\nApril 25th, 2016 - SEOTERIC\n\nThere are several factors that you should consider when selecting and storing horse hay.

{"text": "Best Way to a Stress-Free Retirement\n\nFebruary 28, 2020\n\n3 min read\n\nBy the time you reach retirement age, you've earned the right to relax. Unfortunately, many seniors are finding themselves with too much debt and not enough income–and don't even get me started on Medicare.\n\nNo matter where you are in life, it's never too early to start retirement planning. Here's how to coast into your golden years and enjoy a stress-free retirement.\n\nBasic Steps for Debt-Free, Stree-Free Retirement Planning:\n\nPay off your credit cards\n\nConsolidate your debts, if needed\n\nManage your mortgage\n\nConsider online investing\n\nCredit Card Payoff\n\nYour first step in retirement planning should always be credit card payoff. Carrying credit card debt is a lot like trying to sail a leaky boat–you're constantly bailing water just to stay afloat. Once you pay off your cards, it'll be so much easier to focus on your future. Commit to paying as much as you can every month until those balances hit zero. You might also consider using a rewards credit card. These rewards can be used to pay off future expenses!\n\nDebt Consolidation\n\nOkay, but what if you have a lot of debt scattered across multiple places? That's where debt consolidation can make a difference. When you consolidate your debts, the goal is to get a lower overall interest rate and manage just one monthly payment. This is especially useful if you are trying to cope with credit cards that have high interest rates.\n\nManaging Mortgages\n\nWhen you purchase a home in your 30s, the idea is that you'll be free and clear by the time you retire. But for many people, that's simply not the case. Mortgages are one of those expenses you really can't do much about–unless you decide to sell. Depending on where you are in life–and whether you're thinking about downsizing anyway–you might find that it's actually more economical to rent than own.\n\nConsider Online Investing\n\nMost people stick to basic savings models for their retirement money. You stick part of your paycheck in an employer-matched IRA or 401(k) and then maintain a savings account at your bank. The rates on those accounts tend to be very conservative–low risk, low reward. If you're interested in making your money work for you, it might be worth looking into online investing.\n\nThere are a number of online stock brokers to choose from–NerdWallet does a rundown of the best ones here–and you can choose how much cash you're willing to invest. Just make sure that you don't gamble with more than you could afford to lose", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "a24f7488-080a-4282-bb84-7eaccbd50d55", "url": "https://todaysprayers.com/best-way-to-a-stress-free-retirement/"}

{"text": "World Osteoporosis Day (WOD) is celebrated on every 20th October with the purpose of promoting awareness regarding bone related problems and diseases. It aims to raise better understanding of the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of osteoporosis-a bone related disease that makes bone weak and brittle. This day reminds people to live good quality of life and to love their bone to prevent future complications.\n\nImportant points on osteoporosis-\n\n1. 25 million people are diagnosed with osteoporosis every year.\n\n2. Women are more susceptible to get osteoporosis than men.\n\n3. More than 1.5 million bone fracturesare caused due to osteoporosis.\n\n4. More than half of the cases of the osteoporosis are left undiagnosed and untreated.\n\n5. Your chance of developing osteoporosis increases with the increase in your age.\n\nEveryone wants to be active, look dynamic and live healthy and disease free life, but how healthy are we and our bones? On this osteoporosis day, we would enlighten the facts about the bone health, problems, diagnosis and treatment, and also the ways of the prevention.\n\nWhat is Osteoporosis?\n\nOsteoporosis is a dreadful medical condition that reduces the mass of the bone and makes it weak, porous, and brittle. Osteoporosis can lead to bone fracture even on the small jolt, sneeze or collision.\n\nWhat are the Risk factors?\n\n1. Advanced Age or Old Age (60+)\n\n2. Lack of exercise or physical activity\n\n3. Smoking\n\n4. Alcohol Consumption\n\n5. Calcium less diet\n\n6. Stress and depression\n\nTreatment-\n\nThere is no permanent solution to this problem. Its treatment can give you only temporary relief. So it is advisableto love your bone and follow prevention methods because prevention is better than cure.\n\nHere is the list you can follow in order to prevent Osteoporosis-\n\n1. Increase your Calcium intake: Yes, Calcium plays an important role when it comes to your overall bone health. Increase the calcium-rich food in your diet.\n\n2. Replacing caffeine with milk: Excessive consumption of caffeine put you at risk of osteoporosis.So it is advisable to replace your one cup of coffee with milk.\n\n3. Reduce Sugar Intake: If you want to live a sweet life then surely you need to reduce your sugar consumption. Excess intake of sugar adversely affects your health. It blocks the absorption of the calcium from the food we eat.\n\n3. Salt Intake: We already know that excess sugar consumption leads to high blood pressure and hypertension.People with these problems lose more calcium through urine than others. So cut down your salt consumptions too to prevent calcium scarcity.\n\n4. Protein Intake: Balance your protein intake in your diet. As the excess of the protein forms acid in the body that requires calcium to neutralize it. Your protein intake should be less than 60 grams per day.\n\n5. Maintain a healthy lifestyle: Though we know that it has become difficult to maintain healthy and active lifestyle due to our sedentary job schedule and busy life. But regular exercise, yoga, reducing smoking/alcohol consumption can prevent you to great extent", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "1d75df46-a4d8-4abf-b690-28e38570ba4f", "url": "https://www.doctoriduniya.com/healthfeed/world-osteoporosis-day-2017-love-your-bone-protect-your-future-135/post"}

The Patriots are not among the oldest team because they have a bunch of young un-drafted crap camouflaged by Tom Brady.\n\nI hope he doesn't retire when Tom finally kicks the bucket, because the true shitty GM will look like it.\n\nLaremy Tunsil\n\nLet's be real here, the butt-fumble may have been on Thanksgiving Day, televised, but Sanchez was playing in a game and trying to his best ability, perform (that was a joke too), but this dumbass idiot actually allowed himself to get filmed with a virtual reality high helmet.\n\nThis was taken two years ago, which means the idiot lied about the fact it was in HS, as if that mattered. He is incredibly talented and obviously big enough to play the part of an NFL lineman, but his brain needs growing, unless its true that pot makes you stupid! Why would you ever allow a film of you doing anything that can come back to bite you later in life?\n\nMy beef however is not with the head piece or stupid decision to let it get filmed, but with his arrogance of getting caught. The man left millions on the table as a result of this genius move, and he now has lawyers ready to blame the one that leaked the video, because obviously, that leaker is the real culprit……dumbass!!! This is the result of what our governments have told these kids is right and wrong. Because WikiLeaks was the problem, not their own actions. I am so tired of immature spoiled brats that hide behind \"if they didn't leak it, it never happened\".…Tunsil has shown immaturity and bad decision making. In an NFL world run by Ray Rice videos, this will come back to bite even further down the road.\n\nThe Rex-Rob Show\n\nRex and twin brother Rob grew up fighting, competing, they have never really been able to work together without causing a ruckus. So, what could possibly go wrong in Buffalo?\n\nRex walked into a situation where he couldn't possibly do better than Marrone, after all that was the best Bills season since Paul Revere went for a ride in the country yelling like a drunk. The team was not made to his mold, it was made for someone else, and the fans in an uproar, they wanted Rex gone after less than a full season. As an encore, in a season that can make or destroy this franchise for another five years, he hires Rob.\n\nRob like Rex is an excellent DC, however, Rob has overstayed his welcome everywhere. Imagine now that he has his twin to report to?\n\nThe sideline during the Bills game should provide a lot of entertainment and material for all the Rex starved beat reporters.\n\nHarvard Education is for the birds\n\nRyan Fitzpatrick is a very smart man, we all know this, and his life after football, unless he continues to refuse to slide, is going to be prosperous. This a QB that was not really worthy of long NFL career, he simply doesn't even look the part. By pure luck, he ended up getting coached by Chan Gailey (the Quarterback whisperer), who had previously worked with John Elway and Troy Aikman. Chan turned him into a serviceable quarterback. After he left Chan, Fitz became a journeyman, every team tried to bring back some of the FitzMagic he had displayed in Buffalo. It wasn't until the reunion with the Jets, that Fitz displayed some of the same ability. One year wonder decides that he, the one that has never made more than what journeymen QBs make, he should get paid like the elite ones. Wake up Fitz, you are basically a figurine that Chan plays with.\n\nPolitics\n\nThe narcissistic Canadian has finally realized that America and his own party don't really like him. He may however have a future as another tv evangelical rip off artist.\n\nIf Hillary wins the presidency, do we call drunken nosed Bill the First Man or the First Gentleman?\n\nSpeaking of Narcissus followers, if Trump is the new president, how long before the White House is added on to and renamed Trump towers?\n\nWhy are young college kids always so screwed up when choosing a politician to follow? Maybe we need to redefine the meaning of puberty and when it happens.\n\nThis week we tried to enter this new market with a kinder heart, do not to expect such kindness in the future linebacker", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "1c514aff-b122-48db-b3a8-1d4f772ea9a0", "url": "http://www.thesidelinereport.com/the-instigators-debut/"}
{"text": "Alfred Barnard Nobel was a Swedish chemist, engineer, and innovator born in 1833. As the inventor of dynamite, he amassed a great fortune through the manufacture and sale of armaments. The Nobel Prize was established through his will in1895. Every year since 1901, the Nobel Prize has been awarded for achievements in physics, chemistry, physiology or medicine, literature and for peace.\n\nIt is one of the most impressive accolades any public servant can receive. The fact that the documentary \"An Inconvenient Truth,\" its Academy Award, and Vice President Gore's activism led to this incredible honor is tantamount to the Nobel Committee endorsing his work. Giving him the Nobel Peace Prize places Vice President Gore in the company of greats like Martin Luther King, Jr. in 1964, Mother Teresa In 1979, Lech Walesa in 1983, and Nelson Mandela in 1993.\n\nThrough this award, the international community is saying to us, \"Environmental concerns are very important and America needs to step up to the plate of international leadership!\" Although we would hardly place Gore in the same category as King or Mother Teresa, the award adds cache and credibility to the former Vice President's agenda.\n\nIronically, last week, I asked my readers to consider taking practical steps to frame the debate on the environment. I suggested that we consider weaning the nation off of foreign oil as a way of starting down a balanced approach to both pollution and reducing CO2 emissions. There are a myriad of approaches to energy reform and environmental policy reform that conservatives can take that will help move these issues forward in a balanced manner. My greatest concern is that we will wait too long to attack this issue.\n\nLittle did I know that the Nobel Prize would be awarded to Gore and the IPPC days after my last column. If the Peace Prize causes the voting public of our nation to move environmental issues to the top of the list of public concerns, they will mandate that a solution be found and implemented.\n\nFortunately for the nation, environmental activists have not yet gained enough public attention for them to unveil their \"solutions\". As these activists wait for their \"moment,\" conservatives should use the time we have to develop incentive-based approaches to reducing CO2 emissions. Even increasing the use of nuclear energy as a source of power within the US should not be taken off the table.\n\nMany writers have noted that this present global warming scare is not new. In fact, in the spring of 1975 Newsweek published an article on climate change. The following words were written by sensationalistic journalists:\n\n\"There are ominous signs that the Earth's weather patterns have begun to change dramatically and that these changes may portend a drastic decline in food production – with serious political implications for just about every nation on Earth. The drop in food output could begin quite soon, perhaps only 10 years from now.\"\n\nAccording to many news reports, the Earth was moving into another ice age. Just 30 years later, not only did the ice age not appear, but now we are told the world is on the verge of unprecedented global warming.\n\nIn my discussions with scientists, I have once again discovered a difference between the words of the scientific community and the alarmist rhetoric of writers and activists. In fact, scientific journals of the 1970s were saying that there would likely be warming because of greenhouse effects, sooner than the return of an ice age. Unfortunately, the complexity of the real scientific story was not easily reduced to a thirty second sound bite or a catchy headline.\n\nTelling the full story with all of its scientific nuances, would have not produced headlines. For this reason the science was compromised, conclusions were framed in a sensationalistic manner, and the public was entertained – not informed. It would have been better to say that there are big cooling cycles coming, interspersed with smaller warming cycles.\n\nWhy the flip-flop in the media? I am not sure. Could they be misleading us again? I certainly hope not. In an interesting study of the media's coverage of \"climate change,\" R. Warren Anderson and Dan Gainor examined how major media outlets covered the issue of climate change over the last 100 plus years . What they discovered was that there have been four climate change scares; a concern over global cooling beginning in 1895, followed by fears of global warming in 1929, only to be replaced by alarm over global cooling; now we are back to global warming. With each succeeding crisis, the call for a government solution has grown louder and louder.\n\nEven increasing the use of nuclear energy as a source of power within the US should not be taken off the table.\n\nNot only should it not be taken off the table, it is realistically, the ONLY way we can possibly reduce CO2 emissions substantially, while still maintaining our standard of living and productivity. But see, for the envirofascists, its all about bringing us down to their socialist/luddite utopia..\n\n4\nposted on 10/15/2007 6:31:20 AM PDT\nby Paradox\n(Politics: The art of convincing the populace that your delusions are superior to others.)\n\nthe silver lining to all this is that the Nobel \"Peace\" Prize is forever sullied after Gore's win — it is now seen naked for what it is: merely a vehicle for attacking the United States and capitalism.\n\n5\nposted on 10/15/2007 6:31:50 AM PDT\nby chilepepper\n(The map is not the territory -- Alfred Korzybski)\n\nGiving him the Nobel Peace Prize places Vice President Gore in the company of greats like Martin Luther King, Jr. in 1964, Mother Teresa In 1979, Lech Walesa in 1983, and Nelson Mandela in 1993.\n\nIt also places him in the company of Yasir Arafat, Kofi Anan and Jimmy Carter.

{"text": "Mission to Colonize Mars possible in the near future due to scientists understanding of life in space, technological advances and affordable expenses.\n\nMars is an ideal planet to establish a colony. Its location, temperature and availability of water makes this planet scientists first choice to inhabit (Orwig 2). Earth is not immune from natural disasters (Orwig 2). 165 million years ago, an asteroid hit the Earth and caused such pollution that the dinosaurs became extinct (Orwig 2). This proves how vulnerable we are to mass extinction in the future. Even if new technology fails in the quest for Mars, it might be useful in other areas (Orwig 3). NASA launched the Hubble telescope into space to send back clearer pictures of the space (Orwig 3). Unfortunately, the pictures received were blurry, however, another scientist was able to use the corrected math solution for the Hubble telescope in todays X-ray machines. The result was a better image to detect breast cancer (Orwig 3). Man has always been driven to understand this universe more fully and that is why they explore new areas.\n\nHumans tend to move and establish communities, town and cities. NASA believes the mission to Mars is comparable to the early pioneers of American or to landing on the moon (Knapton 2). Both were great accomplishments of mankind. Just like the early explorers purpose of travel was to establish a colony, it is the same for Mars (Knapton 2). The early explores sent out scouts and they reported back their findings to see if a colony could or should be establish. NASA has been sending probes and robots to Mars for the last 40 years (Knapton 4). These probes have discovered salt water and ancient lakes (Knapton 4). NASA will continue to send probes and robots to learn more about the possibility of life either past, present or future on Mars (Knapton 4).\n\nIf the fastest probe to date, traveled in a straight line it would take 162 days to reach Mars (Redd 4). It would have travelled 33.9 million miles or 54.6 million kilometer (Redd 3). Scientists base these numbers on the arrival time not the launch time (Redd 5). Since the planets are always moving towards and away from the sun at different times these calculation also change constantly. Another huge challenge is the financial aspect to colonize Mars.\n\nElon Musk was speaking to the International Congress in Guadalajara, Mexico in 2016 (Glaser 1). He expressed his plans as to how to finance the colonization of Mars (Glaser 3). One problem was to convince the US Government to help finance it (Glaser 3). The public could argue that these funds would be better used to feed the poor, improve schools or communities than sending people to Mars. Musk summarized that the first 12 astronauts would cost 12 billion dollars (Glaser 3). However, if one million people signed up the cost would drop to $200,000 per person (Glaser 3). There are seven billion people on earth so finding one million people to pay for a trip of a lifetime is reasonable. How to support life, shelter and return to earth are other factors that were also addressed (Ghose 7). The International Space Station has taught us many things about survival in space. Using this knowledge we have a better understanding of the needs required for survival and how to do it (Ghose 7). The key to life on Mars is he availability of water.\n\nMars has ice water under its soil and therefore, can support life. With the use of technology, we can use a water extractor to heat the soil and collect the condensed water (Will 1). Storage units that hold 1500 liters of water per person would be built for daily needs. Oxygen can be split from the water and turned into breathable air. Mars's air carbon dioxide, light, water and added nutrients can be used to grow food in hydroponics (Will 2). It is not feasible to continually transport supplies from Earth to Mars for the inhabitants.\n\nMany trips must first be taken to Mars in unmanned ships to drop off food, shelter and building supplies and also establish a reliable power source before man can stay on Mars (Maclver 2). NASA building plans will resemble a trailer park of interconnected buildings (Maclver 2). The structures would include; housing units, storage units for food, and life support supplies, recreational spaces and other necessities for survival (Maclver 2). In order to build these modules robots would be used to establish the shelters before mans' arrival.\n\nThree robots have already been developed for use on Mars: Axle rovers, MMSEV and the Robonauts (Maclver 3). The main problem with these robots is communication (Maclver 6). To send a command from Earth to the robot on Mars is a 20-minute delay (Maclver 6). The Axel robot has independent wheels so its use would be to collect rock and water for analysis (Maclver 3). The MMSEV robot has a cabin feature attached, so no space suit is required (Maclver 4). The problem with the space suit is that is takes hours to put on and adjust the pressure to be in Mars' atmosphere (Maclver 4). Without the space suit the astronaut could take many trips outside the compound during the day (Maclver 4). The Robonaut resemble a human and would be used to set up the compound before humans arrive on Mars (Maclver 5). These robots would be indispensible to us surviving on Mars.\n\nSpaceX's mission to Mars is not a one trip (Wall 3). The company would use solar power for electricity (Wall 3). Solar power would also be combined with carbon dioxide and water to make methane gas to power the rockets to return to earth (Wall 3). All of this technology has been invented and would have more improvements in time.\n\nColonization of Mars can and could be reached in our lifetime. Our technology has advanced to make living on Mars possible. If the US or other governments fund the initial cost, individual donors can pay for subsequent flights. Our survival as a race might be depended on colonizing another planet against catastrophic natural disasters here on Earth. Once a Mars colony is establish, perhaps a new culture will emerge to better enhance our own society with new discoveries.

Cutting-edge technologies, such as as Internet of Things (IoT), Cloud Computing (CC), Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN), Big Data Analytics (BDA), Compressed Sensing (CS), Augmented Reality/Virtual Reality (AR/VR) and 5G Networking can contribute in the field of smart education. However, smart education is currently in an embryonic 2D data representational state. In this paper, we propose a new Revolutionary Interactive Smart Classroom (RISC) which will provide a virtual environment for enhanced learning experience, based on 5G Network. This classroom will also make use of 3D virtual services in combination with haptic equipment and sensors, in order to carry out augmented human sensing information and touch into the virtual class.

{"text": "7 Days to Better Writing – Day 5: Define Your Audience\n\nJuly 15, 2016\n\nIt is important that you define your audience for writing. Understanding who you are writing for will determine the tone of your writing. Knowing who you are writing for will allow you to better captivate your audience.\n\nDetermine Who Will Read Your Writing\n\nThe first step that you need to take to define your audience is to determine who will read your writing. You will need to figure out if the audience that you are writing for is primarily technical, business, or leisurely. You will then need to look at the demographics within those groups to ensure that you are able to write in a manner that will grab their attention.\n\nWho is Your Primary Audience?\n\nTo determine your primary audience, you need to think about who is going to be reading your work. There are three main audiences that you will need to consider:\n\nBusiness\n\nTechnical\n\nLeisure\n\nOnce you have determined which category your writing falls into, you will need to determine the demographics of the category that you are trying to reach. Each category will need to be broken down further to refine your audience.\n\nBusiness\n\nIf your writing will be business-focused, you need to make sure that you are familiar with the business for which you will be writing. When you are writing for business there are a couple of questions that you will want to ask yourself:\n\nWhat type of business am I writing for?\n\nIs my primary audience male or female?\n\nWhat is the average age of people in this type of business?\n\nAm I teaching or informing?\n\nOnce you have answered these questions, you should have a general idea as to what style of writing you want to use. Each of these questions will help you narrow done the time and style that you want to use when you are writing.\n\nTechnical\n\nTechnical writing is a whole other beast. Often your audience will have an expertise in a certain area and you need to ensure that your writing takes advantage of that, providing more in-depth topics when writing about a known subject matter or higher-level overviews when the audience is not as familiar with the topic. Here are a few questions you will want to ask yourself before you write:\n\nWhat level of education does my target audience have?\n\nAm I explaining myself in a way that makes sense?\n\nHow is the reader going to use this material?\n\nWhat age group is my target audience?\n\nThese questions will help you determine the level of writing you will need to use. By using these guidelines, technical folks will be more inclined to consume your writing.\n\nLeisure\n\nThere are a number of questions that you need to ask when you are writing for leisure. There are a number of different genres that you have to consider as well as a number of different sub-genres that you should be familiar with. We list only a few of the questions you should be asking if you choose to write for a leisurely audience:\n\nWhat genre are you writing?\n\nWhat age group are you writing for?\n\nAre you writing for men or women?\n\nIs the intent to entertain or inform?\n\nThese questions are only a guideline to help you set the tone of your writing. If you intend to write for this audience, make sure you truly understand their needs as a slight misstep on this front could result in nobody reading your writing.\n\nRemember to Define Your Audience for Writing\n\nKeeping these simple things in mind will allow you to define your audience for writing. Visualize this audience as you begin to write and your tone will naturally come. Again, if you are unsure about who your audience is, you can simply ask these questions:\n\nAre you writing for business, technical, or leisure?\n\nWhat age group are you writing for?\n\nAre your readers going to understand what you are trying to say?\n\nAre you writing for men, women, or both?\n\nUnderstanding these key points will allow you to become a great writer with whom readers eagerly engage. Misunderstanding who your audience is, on the other hand, can lead to you wasting your time writing something no one will read", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "4a0631cf-fec5-4a51-b732-c034a089d8a1", "url": "https://capitalizemytitle.com/7-days-to-better-writing-day-5-define-your-audience/"}
{"text": "periods of greek history\n\nDuring this period [500-323 BC], Greece reaches the height of economic success and cultural and artistic splendor. Top Tag's. In order to truly understand what Ancient Greece was like, it helps to get an overview of the time periods, starting with the Neolithic Period and ending with the Hellenistic Period. to the first century B.C., Greek art can be broken down into four periods: geometric, archaic, classical and Hellenistic. Following military reversals against the Persians, the treasury was moved from Delos to Athens, further strengthening the latter's control over the League. These discoveries influenced trade in the Mediterranean and advanced their economy. Despite Greek defeat at Thermopylae, after which the Persians briefly overran northern and central Greece,[11] the Greek city-states once again managed to comprehensively defeat the invaders with naval victory at Salamis and victory on land at Plataea. early archaic period greece, The Ancient Greek sculptures are a unique art form that developed over centuries. They often buried daggers or some other form of military equipment with the deceased. Archaeological evidence tells us that many of the medieval towns, including Athens, Thessaloniki, Thebes and Corinth, experienced a period of rapid and sustained growth, starting in the 11th century and continuing until the end of the 12th century. The economy of Greece was devastated. According to Alan Harvey's Economic Expansion in the Byzantine Empire 900–1200, towns expanded significantly in the twelfth century. Its expansionist foreign policy triggers revolts throughout the Hellenic world and rivalry with Sparta, Corinth, Thebes, and Syracuse leads to much fighting and bloodshed. Little specific information is known about the Minoans (even the name Minoans is a modern appellation, derived from Minos, the legendary king of Crete), including their written system, which was recorded on the undeciphered Linear A script[5] and Cretan hieroglyphs. In Latin-occupied territories, elements of feudality entered medieval Greek life. The Greek Civil War (Greek: Eμφύλιος πόλεμος, romanized: Emfílios pólemos) was the first major confrontation of the Cold War. Archaeological evidence shows an increase in the size of urban settlements, together with a 'notable upsurge' in new towns. Part of the problem is that there weren't many known historians. This list gives you some of the highlights of each period. Ancient Greek philosophy focused on the role of reason and inquiry. Corinth intervened on the Epidamnian side. 431-404 BCE. With Pericles gone, less conservative elements gained power in the city and Athens went on the offensive. In 1973, the régime abolished the Greek monarchy and in 1974, dictator Papadopoulos denied help to the United States. All this suggests that there was an increased demand for art, with more people having access to the necessary wealth to commission and pay for such work. Time period of the Peloponnesian Wars. [14] The millet system contributed to the ethnic cohesion of Orthodox Greeks by segregating the various peoples within the Ottoman Empire based on religion. The great centres of Hellenistic culture were Alexandria and Antioch, capitals of Ptolemaic Egypt and Seleucid Syria. Ove… Historical Time Periods 27/08/2020 27/08/2020 by Heather Y Wheeler This timeline gives a chronological listing of all historical time periods from prehistory to present day They were primarily a mercantile people engaged in extensive overseas trade throughout the Mediterranean region. Fearful lest Corinth capture the Corcyran navy (second only to the Athenian in size), Athens intervened. The Romans left local administration to the Greeks without making any attempt to abolish traditional political patterns. The Delian League was eventually referred to pejoratively as the Athenian Empire. This meant that when Greece went to war (e.g., against the Persian Empire), it took the form of an alliance going to war. British troops had already landed on 4 October in Patras, and entered Athens on 14 October 1944. The outbreak of World War I in 1914 produced a split in Greek politics, with King Constantine I, an admirer of Germany, calling for neutrality while Prime Minister Eleftherios Venizelos pushed for Greece to join the Allies. [36][37] This crisis of confidence was indicated by a widening of bond yield spreads and risk insurance on credit default swaps compared to other countries, most importantly Germany. With its love of luxury and passion for color, the art of this age delighted in the production of masterpieces that spread the fame of Byzantium throughout the Christian world. In 225 BC, Macedon defeated the Egyptian fleet at Cos and brought the Aegean islands, except Rhodes, under its rule as well. Hispano-Moorish art was unquestionably derived from the Byzantine. Written by GreekBoston.com in Ancient Greek History, Greek Culture\nThe leading role of Constantinople began when Constantine the Great turned Byzantium into the new capital of the Roman Empire, from then on to be known as Constantinople, placing the city at the center of Hellenism, a beacon for the Greeks that lasted to the modern era. When the Dorians came down into Greece they also were equipped with superior iron weapons, easily dispersing the already weakened Mycenaeans. Although the establishment of Roman rule did not break the continuity of Hellenistic society and culture, which remained essentially unchanged until the advent of Christianity, it did mark the end of Greek political independence. The predominance of the small free farmers, the expansion of the military estates and the development of the system of themes, brought to completion developments that had started in the previous period. August/September 480 BCE: Battle of Thermopylae: The Persians defeated the Greeks in the Battle off Thermopylae: September 480 BCE: Battle of Salamis The civil war left Greece with a legacy of political polarization. [17] However, Turkish nationalists, led by Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, overthrew the Ottoman government and organised a military campaign against the Greek troops, resulting in the Greco-Turkish War (1919-1922). There weren't always people living in Ancient Greece – they needed to travel to the region first. Their general, Epaminondas, crushed Sparta at the Battle of Leuctra in 371 BC, inaugurating a period of Theban dominance in Greece. A major Greek offensive ground to a halt in 1921, and by 1922 Greek troops were in retreat. From the 10th to the 12th century, Byzantium was the main source of inspiration for the West. As a result, Greece also entered into an alliance with the United States and joined NATO, while relationships with its communist northern neighbours, both pro-Soviet and neutral, became strained. The French and British seized its major port and effectively neutralized the Greek army. Such was the influence of Byzantine art in the 12th century, that Russia, Venice, southern Italy and Sicily all virtually became provincial centers dedicated to its production. By the late 6th century BC, the Achaemenid Persian Empire ruled over all Greek city states in Ionia (the western coast of modern-day Turkey) and had made territorial gains in the Balkans and Eastern Europe proper as well. \"Resolution on Genocides Committed by the Ottoman Empire\", \"Genocide Resolution approved by Swedish Parliament — full text\", \"Peripheral euro zone government bond spreads widen\", \"Greek/German bond yield spread more than 1,000 bps\", \"An Archaeological Scenario for the \"Coming of the Greeks\", \"8. In common usage it refers to all Greek history before the Roman Empire, but historians use the term more precisely. The Archaic is one of five periods that Ancient Greek history can be divided into; it was preceded by the Dark Ages and followed by the Classical period. 470-479 BCE. Militarily, Greece itself declined to the point that the Romans conquered the land (168 BC onwards), though Greek culture would in turn conquer Roman life. During the Archaic Period the Greek government began to form with the rise of the city-states such as Athens and Sparta. The first migration entailed the Greek intelligentsia migrating to Western Europe and influencing the advent of the Renaissance. The beginning is prehistory. During this time, there were three phases of Greek history: Archaic Greece, Classical Greece, and the Hellenistic Period. The Archaic period of Greek history lasted from the 8th century BCE to the second Persian invasion of Greece in 480 BCE. Some Greeks became crypto-Christians to avoid heavy taxes and at the same time express their identity by maintaining their ties to the Greek Orthodox Church. It is during this period that the culture of Ancient Greece truly started to develop, most especially the art and sculpture. Ancient Greek history roughly begins in the 12th century BC, lasting until it was conquered and made a Roman province in 146 BC. [5] In 1425 BC, the Minoan palaces (except Knossos) were devastated by fire, which allowed the Mycenaean Greeks, influenced by the Minoans' culture, to expand into Crete. Greek culture was a powerful influence in the Roman Empire, which carried a version of it to many parts of Europe. Here's an overview of the different time periods of Ancient Greece: There weren't always people living in Ancient Greece – they needed to travel to the region first. As a result of the Balkan Wars of 1912–1913, most of Epirus, Macedonia, Crete and the northern Aegean islands were incorporated into the Kingdom of Greece. From the 6th to the 4th century, Athens was the dominating power in the Aegean Sea and had developed strong connections with ports around the Mediterranean Sea. Under his auspices, the Peace of Naupactus (217 BC) brought conflict between Macedon and the Greek leagues to an end, and at this time he controlled all of Greece except Athens, Rhodes and Pergamum.

{"text": "Changing Blaming Cultures\n\nCulture change in organizations is always challenging, but changing a blaming culture presents special difficulties. Here are three reasons why.\n\nA Carrick Mat, a fine example of a decorative mat made from a single cord. The ends are tucked neatly out of sight. The mat can be pulled apart by the ends of the cord, but when they are joined, pulling any part of the mat might distort it somewhat, but the mat will maintain its integrity.\n\nSo it is with blame when blame is part of the fabric of organizational culture. Suppressing blame-based behavior is not an effective means of driving it from the culture. Instead, we must find ways to motivate all members of the culture to alter their own behavior. Compelling abstinence from blame-based behavior patterns does not work.\n\nWhen organizations undertake to change their cultures, the cultures sometimes behave as if they were unwilling to change. They can behave almost as if they had minds and wills of their own. Because this phenomenon is especially noticeable when we're transforming a blaming culture, it's useful to understand how blaming cultures \"fight back.\"\n\nAn organizational culture is a blaming culture if blame plays a significant role in regulating behavior to ensure compliance with organizational expectations. Blaming cultures have difficulty reaching high levels of performance, in part because their people generally fear taking even reasonable risks. For example, a fear of being blamed for insubordination can cause an employee to refrain from questioning a superior's decision, even when that decision ought to be questioned. For more examples of the traits of blaming cultures, see \"Top Ten Signs of a Blaming Culture,\" Point Lookout for February 16, 2005.\n\nWhen we try to reduce the incidence of blaming in a culture, we encounter special challenges. Here are three examples of what makes changing a blaming culture so difficult.\n\nBlaming becomes covert\n\nThose advocating for removing blame as a management tool are likely to encounter supervisors who are accustomed to \"killing the messenger.\" Change agents might sense progress when people deliver bad news without being subject to retribution, but the reality can be rather different.\n\nSupervisors might not immediately \"kill the messenger,\" but they might eventually get around to it. For example, they can delay the execution for months or years to make it seem unrelated to the message delivery incident. The actual execution can take on any form, such as termination during a layoff or reorganization. In some cases, retribution can be delivered not by the offending supervisor, but by a proxy.\n\nDiscussions of blaming are taboo\n\nIn a blaming When blaming is a cultural trait, changing the culture is especially challengingculture that's attempting a transition, questioning incidents, procedures, or policies that are illustrative of the former blaming approach to behavior management can be interpreted as blaming and criticism. People who raise these issues are sometimes criticized for manifesting the old behaviors. The old ways remain in place because we regard questioning them as examples of the old ways.\n\nIt's axiomatic that we cannot change what we cannot talk about. Unless we can openly discuss the costs and constraints of the status quo, coming to consensus as a group about ways to transform the status quo can remain out of reach.\n\nChange is blamed for hiccups\n\nAll change entails loss. All culture change degrades organizational performance temporarily, as people try new ways of working together. But in blaming cultures, the habit of blaming leads to blaming the change itself for the temporary productivity loss.\n\nInstead of accepting the loss as a cost of change, the change is criticized for the loss. That can lead to rejection of the change on the basis of degraded performance.\n\nOnce blame settles into an organizational culture, it provides the culture and its people with all the tools they need to defend the status quo.

When we're unaware of them, they can\nlimit our ability to change.\n\nYou may have heard the phrase \"plenty of blame to go around,\" or maybe you've even used it\nyourself. Although it sometimes does bring an end to immediate finger pointing, it also validates blame\nas a general approach. Here's how to end the blaming by looking ahead.\n\nUnderstanding Power, Authority, and Influence depends on familiarity with the kinds of authority found\nin organizations. Here's Part II of a little catalog of authority, emphasizing informal authority.\n\nSometimes changing organizations goes smoothly. More often, it doesn't.

{"text": "Nadine Finlay shares how she and her school have been adapting to the 'new normal'.\n\nHow do you enrich your curriculum?\n\nHave you ever asked yourself how you could provide that little extra for the children you spend each day with?\n\nThese questions have been pondered recently by leadership teams all over the country including my own and personally, I have been desperately seeking to enrich the areas of the curriculum that I've been developing in my own setting. Aiming to not only cover the three I's but to also captivate the children while making it relevant to our cohort and local environment is a real challenge. We found ourselves asking an array of questions:\n\nWhat can we do in our local area?\n\nWhat do we need to cover in the curriculum?\n\nHow do we do it?\n\nWhat do we have nearby that can be used to enhance the curriculum?\n\nEach time we come back to the same thing… What benefit is it for the children? This has been the crux of everything we've done. Writing a curriculum is challenging at the best of times but when faced with a pandemic we've needed to get a bit creative and I'd like to share some of the things I've learnt, in the hope that it helps others who are working on their curriculum too.\n\nI try to keep the children at the heart of everything and when I reminisce about my own education it's the fun that sings out to me. I don't really remember the details about algebra for example and history was unbelievably dry but I know every element of the science lesson where the teacher blew his eyebrows off and the route we took on the geography expedition hiking around Wales. The enrichment that these life experiences brought to lessons made them not only enjoyable but memorable and that is what I want to bring to the children I spend my days with. I want them to not only remember the topics that we focus on but also learn the key information, be excited about it, and more than that… I want these experiences to help shape them and the person they will become in the future.\n\nWhen writing the curriculum and planning a unit of work I've made a point initially of looking at the families we have in school. Are there some careers that we could tap into? It's always good to get parents and grandparents to come into school and share their own experiences. We live in a multicultural society, my particular school has links with many countries in the commonwealth, so when it comes to festivals such as Fiji Day it is always wonderful to explore full traditional dress, taste test real foods cooked using traditional techniques and learn dances that are unique to the Fijian islands.\n\nCovid has provided another level of enrichment that I had not appreciated before. I've found that companies have staff that are sitting around, desperate to be working and doing things but unable to get out and about. As I planned a geography unit focusing on renewable energy I emailed as many different people as I could find who were in some way related to renewable energy, from large well-known companies to small independent land farms. This led to one of the UK's largest household named, electrical companies running a Zoom meeting with the Year 4's about how offshore windfarms are built. Something which many children had not encountered before and are not likely to during their own time. What was magical about this was that the person at the other end of the Zoom call was in Stirling, Scotland while the class were in Wiltshire.\n\nWhen planning a geography/ science unit for the Year 2's that compares conservation of local wildlife in Wiltshire compared to the Fijian coral reef I once again contacted everyone I could possibly think of. I wanted to provide the children with the understanding that although conservation work is happening for different animals, it is similar in so much as people are protecting wildlife all over the World. The response I've had has been amazing, from large organisations reaching out, to the smaller animal support groups who are as eager as I am to captivate these young minds. We now have packages for the children arriving through the post with supporting work in preparation for our virtual visitors. One visitor will focus on the conservation of our local area, one is a cartographer who will teach the children how to make maps, while one is in Fiji, focusing on rebuilding the coral gardens.\n\nI am swiftly beginning to appreciate how the world of virtual visits provides the children with opportunities that they wouldn't normally have had. I could never have taken my class of Year 2's to Fiji to see the coral garden conservation work and yet through the wonders of technology, they are going to be able to see the amazing work that is being done, ask their questions, and form a link with this fantastic organistion.\n\nWhat a truly wonderful way to enrich the curriculum and bring learning to life! Isn't it wonderful that something good has come out of this pandemic and I hope this new form of enrichment can be maintained and developed even more?\n\nAdmittedly nothing quite compares to a real-life visit however in the current situation we find ourselves in, if you're developing a unit of work or looking to enrich next term's units, I recommend that you start emailing companies. They may have links they are happy to share with you or point you in the direction of others who could be a virtual visitor and the children in your class will not only love it but learn so much.

{"text": "​​​​​​​​​​​​Cold Water Applications​\n\nThe scale of damage and financial cost of water pipe​s burst due to freezing can be devastating. Insulation offsets pipe freezing and is highly recommended. Domestic cold water in the UK is piped directly into homes from a central supply. As water pipes enter a building they create weak points, known as thermal bridges, in the building fabric through which heat is lost. Condensation can also form on the cold surface of the pipe inside the building.\n\nCold water pipe insulation plays an important role in preventing these problems but the prevention of pipe freezing is by far the single greatest reason for insulating cold water pipework. Water left stationary and exposed to sub-zero temperatures will eventually freeze. As pipes freeze water expands and the pressure exerted is enough to either burst pipes along the length or to break pipe connections apart.\n\nBy greatly slowing the rate of freezing insulation makes pipe freezing much less likely.

{"text": "Why do you need Caregiver to take care of the Elderly?\n\nWhy Caregivers?\n\nHiring caregivers in Malaysia is getting significantly popular as time goes by and has been for the past 6 years. This one-of-a-kind care is already a blooming preference in other countries such as America and Australia.\n\nLet's be brutally honest. No matter how much you fight with your parents, how much you argue- in the end, you still want the best for them and you want them to be happy. It is stated in the Journal of the American Medical Directors Association that depression is a very common occurrence in the elderly in the nursing home.\n\nA few main reasons would be due to them being in a foreign and unfamiliar place, the feeling of abandonment and, of course, being away from their loved ones. So, why send your parents or grandparents to a nursing home when you are able to give them wholesome care in the comfort of their home?\n\nFor many years, maids have been the only option for in-house care for the elderly, young children and babies. Unfortunately, because they specialize in domestic household work, they do not have the proper knowledge or best-practiced skills to care for your loved ones properly.\n\n​\n\n1) Safety\nThis is always a concern wherever and whenever. From driving a car, to cooking to even taking a walk in the park, you always think about safety. So why should you compromise safety when caring for your loved ones?\n\nCaregivers are trained to assess the safety of the client's surrounding environment, their own safety and of course the safety of those around them. Maids, however, are not taught to assess the client's surrounding environment to ensure that accidents do not happen. For example, a caregiver will ensure that the bathroom is dry and not slippery before taking your grandmother in, whereas a maid may not think about doing that.\n\nThat is an example of a non-complicated situation. What happens when there are more factors which has to be taken to account, such as IV drips, or catheters and wheelchairs? Would you rather rely on a trained or untrained person to handle it safely?\n\n2) Health & hygiene\nHygiene is a basic necessity of every living human being. It is a known fact that poor hygiene can lead to all sorts of health problems including rashes, lice, infected wounds and infection in general. Body odour, bad breath, greasy hair, dirty and smelly clothes can lead to problems socialising as it inhibits a person to be able to give a good first impression.\n\nCaregivers are responsible for the client's hygiene as well as the hygiene of their surroundings. They are trained to clean and shower a client effectively and not miss any parts. They are also trained to look out for skin problems, keep their skin integrity intact, and ensure that their hands and feet are moisturised among many other things.\n\nMaids, however, are not trained to do those things and very few would have sufficient knowledge from their past experiences. Nursing homes will not be able to supply that sort of care thoroughly as there are many other residents who require care. When a person is cleaned thoroughly and feels fresh, they will feel a lot more comfortable.\n\nFurthermore, caregivers know how to move and reposition a bedridden client appropriately and comfortably. This is important as it prevents pressure injuries and promotes blood circulation.\n\n3) Convenience\nThere are many working adults who only require help with transferring and looking after their parents/ grandparents while they are away at work. With caregivers, they are able to choose the period of time whereby there is someone at home capable and trained to care for their loved ones. Clients are able to arrange when the caregiver arrives and leaves.", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "cddfa2f2-cebe-415b-80c4-72573e677990", "url": "https://www.24angelshomecare.com/why-caregiver"}
{"text": "CFD TRADING ON WTI CRUDE OIL - HOW TO AND GUIDE\n\nOil is a highly volatile asset, and this high volatility creates many trading opportunities for traders. At the same time, you can use it to hedge investment in other assets, diversify portfolio, and take a stake on geopolitical issues. The best part about trading oil is that it is very accessible, and available for 24 hours a day and 5 days a week; all of everything is available online. To get into trading crude oil, you need to know the reason of oil price movements, impactful factors for oil prices, and the methods and strategies for trading oil charts. Let's start.\n\nWhat are Brent Crude and WTI oil?\n\nCrude oil refers to fossil fuel and unrefined petroleum. It contains hydrocarbon deposits and several organic materials. By refining it, usable products like gasoline, petrochemicals such as plastics, diesel, fertilisers, and medicines can be produced. Oil is a basic and crucial component in the global economy. According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), the total consumption of oil in the world is nearly 93 million barrels per day. The commodity not only plays a major role in our daily lives but is also closely followed by businesses, economists, and obviously, traders. Crude oil is one of the most traded commodities globally. It is used as a tool for investment, hedging, speculation, diversification, and more.\n\nTwo of the most popular benchmarks for trading oil on MetaTrader 4 and MetaTrader 5 are Brent Crude and WTI.\n\nBent Crude: Bent Crude oil is North Sea Brent Crude. It is the second popular benchmark when it comes to trading oil. It serves as a scale for the price of oil. Bent Crude oil is mostly extracted from the North Sea. It is refined in the Northwest Europe. Brent is a primary oil type in North Africa and Europe.\n\nWTI: The full form of WTI is West Texas Intermediate. WTI is a high-quality crude oil that is also known as US Crude. The oil is exported and used all over across the world. This light and sweet crude oil is refined in the United States. It usually costs $1 to $2 higher than Brent Crude oil. Like Brent Crude, it also serves as an oil benchmark. Its price is used as a reference for sellers and buyers of crude oil, and the media also quotes it as the price of oil.\n\nWhat Is the OPEC Basket?\n\nApart from Brent Crude oil and WTI, OPEC oil is another important factor in the global market. OPEC stands for Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries. OPEC oil is a combination of seven types of crude oil, from Saudi Arabia, Dubai, Mexican Isthmus, Venezuela, Algeria, and Nigeria. It is less sweet and darker than both Brent and WTI. Although OPEC oil is usually cheaper, yet it is important in the global market.\n\nWhat Affects the Price of Oil?\n\nOil Supply & Demand: Oil is one of those resources that are not located in all countries. Therefore, the production of oil is strenuous. About a hundred countries produce oil, which is about half of the world. Five of these countries produce 49.6% of the world's total crude oil production. It gives these countries and oil associations more control over their supply and impact price. They can increase the oil production to make a profit when they think price is good. At the same time, they can also decrease their production to prevent prices from falling or to increase them. Demand for oil grows when the global economy performs well since consumers buy more products, factories produce and transport more goods, companies invest more, and consumers travel more for both business purpose and leisure. On the contrary, a weakening global economy leaves the opposite effect, and demand for oil decreases.\n\nGeopolitics Effect on Oil: Only five countries produce about half the crude oil in the world. So, tension in one of these countries can cause crucial issues with supply. For example, a war or conflict in an oil-producing region may pose a threat to inventories, as well as production and refinement facilities, and it can cause a spike in the price of oil.\n\nDollar Strength: The value of the US dollar has a direct impact on the price of crude oil. If the value of dollar drops, both WTI and Brent Crude oil rise in value. Similarly, when the value of dollar rises, the price of crude oil drops. However, it does not necessarily reflect minor or daily fluctuations in the value of dollar. Only significant changes in the dollar strength results in corresponding changes in the price of oil.\n\nBenefits of Trading Crude Oil\n\nSince crude oil is one of the most popular assets in the world for trading and investment, there are many benefits of trading crude oil, such as –\n\nVolatility: Oil prices have high volatility. The large price movements are one of the most important advantages of trading Brent Crude and WTI oil. The price of crude oil moves up and down with considerable swings. Look at the chart below to see the price movement. This price movement offers the potential of capitalising on the movements through swing trading, intra-week trading, and intra-day trading.\n\nDiversification: Having all eggs in one basket is struggling for a lot of traders and investors. People's wealth is tied up in property in many Western countries such as the UK, the US, and Australia. On the contrary, assets such as shares account for a large portion of personal wealth in other countries. It is dangerous because if a single market falls, the entire portfolio of an investor is at risk to be wiped out. You can reduce this risk by trading a range of markets and thus, diversifying your portfolio. Investing in commodities like crude oil through trading is a great way for diversifying your portfolio and managing your risks.\n\nTrading fundamentals: New traders find many markets intimidating because they depend on technical signals. However, crude oil is influenced by fundamental events heavily, like, as mentioned earlier, geopolitical tensions. It means that you can find interesting trading opportunities if you follow the news regularly.\n\nHow to Trade in Crude Oil\n\nOil is a very interesting market and there are many ways you can trade and invest in it. People usually assume that purchasing a barrel of oil and selling it a higher price when the price increases is the simplest and most straightforward way to invest in crude oil. However, the reality is far from assumption. It is actually very difficult for an investor or a retail trader. Unlike some other commodities such as gold and silver, it is difficult to store oil. Moreover, it is highly toxic and needs significant insurance. So, you may go for these practical methods of investing and trading oil –\n\nInvesting in oil stocks\n\nA great way of investing in oil and earning profits when the price goes up is to invest in the stocks of companies that are involved in exploring, producing, and refining oil. These companies include global behemoths like Royal Dutch Shell, Total SA, BP, and Exxon Mobil. However, this approach is a bit challenging because you are not investing in oil directly but in the shares. Now, the share prices may not always reflect changes in the oil price. It happens because there are many other factors that play a role in valuing a company beyond the price of the product. These factors include management changes, regulation, and dividends that may impact a business.\n\nInvesting in oil ETFs\n\nAnother great option for trading oil is investing in commodity ETFs or oil ETFs. ETF stands for exchange-traded funds. It is an asset that is a bundle of other assets like stocks that can be chosen by an investor to trade or invest in. Its main benefit is that the investor is provided with the opportunity of investing in or trading a larger market, instead of having to pick individual instruments. For example, if you want to invest in US tech stocks but do not want to add individual stocks to their portfolio, then you can search for an ETF representing the US tech stock market.\n\nThere is a wide range of commodity ETFs you can choose from to trade, including crude oil ETFs. Oil companies' stocks and crude oil futures can be included to them. Like investing in other instruments like shares, the traditional way of investing in an ETF is to invest at one price and then close it when the price of the ETF increases. Thus, you can make a profit on that difference. However, you can also trade ETFs via a derivative called a CFD that allows a trader to trade in both directions. So, traders can earn profit whether the market rises or falls.\n\nTrading oil CFDs\n\nCFD stands for Contract for Difference. It is a tool that allows traders to trade price changes in crude oil but they do not need to invest in the physical assets or handle physical contracts. Instead, you can start trading by signing up for an account with a CFD broker. After that, you need to download and install the trading platform provided by the broker. A demo account can be used with virtual money for demo trading but you have to deposit funds into your live accounts. Now, you are all set to open and close trades on the trading platform.\n\nTrading oil futures\n\nTrading oil futures is a common option whether you are trading Brent Crude oil or WTI oil. A futures contract is a legal agreement to purchase or sell an asset at a predetermined value at a certain time in the future. A trader does not have much interest to receive the asset itself. They are only trading the contract to earn a profit.\n\nFor instance, assume that a futures contract for oil trades at $55 a barrel. Now, if a trader thinks that the oil price would rise before the contract expires, they could buy the contract with the expectation that the contract can be closed at a profit. If their prediction is right and the, and the oil price increases, to $58 for example, when it expires or the trader closes it, they will make a profit of $3 per barrel. So, for 1,000 barrels of oil, the trader would make a profit of $3,000 in total. However, if their prediction goes wrong and the price falls to $54, then they would lose $1,000.\n\nHow to Trade Crude Oil in IQ Option\n\nIQ Option can help you get started if you want to trade crude oil. To start trading, you have to open a trading account on IQ Option first. It is very easy to do; you only need to click on the 'Sign up' button at the top of the homepage. The new account can be registered by filling in a simple online registration form or via existing accounts on Google or Facebook. If you are a beginner, it is a good idea to start with a demo account. On the demo account, you can learn the basics of trading crude oil and test your trading strategies in a risk-free environment without spending real money. There are two ways to trade crude oil on IQ Option, such as\n\nFutures: You can buy oil futures at IQ Option. These are highly volatile and risky, but they offer great returns. However, you must trade oil futures only after you have researched and studied about it thoroughly. Also, keep in mind that trading oil futures without capital is not worth it.\n\nETFs: You can trade ETFs on IQ Option just like you trade stocks of major companies. For example. For example, if you purchase a share of US oil Fund (USO), then you would be trading a barrel of oil. Take note that by trading ETFs related to the energy sector and mutual funds related to the energy sector, you get exposure to crude oil indirectly. ETFs and mutual funds based on the energy sector invest on oil stocks and oil companies exclusively and the risks of trading these ETFs are very low.\n\nTrading CFDs v/s Futures\n\nFutures and CFDs are two of the most common ways to trade crude oil. So, it is common for traders to compare both instruments to see which is the most suitable for them. Here are the main differences of the two assets\n\nCFD Trading\n\nFutures Trading\n\nUsually, no expiry dates\n\nThere are expiry dates (Monthly or quarterly)\n\nTrade via a counterparty (Your broker)\n\nTrade via an exchange (NYMEX), CBOT, CME)\n\nNo ownership of product\n\nNo ownership of product\n\nCan trade long and short\n\nCan trade long and short\n\nTradable on leverage\n\nTradable on leverage\n\nCan trade more than 3,000 markets\n\nLess markets available than CFDs\n\nStrategies for Trading Oil\n\nOnce you find a broker that will allow you to trade oil online, you must think from a strategic perspective about how to do it. It is vital to implement risk management in trading properly, but you also must apply specific oil trading strategies. You can split most trading methods into different trading styles and timeframes.\n\nTrading styles\n\nTechnical analysis: You need to analyse price charts via bars or candlesticks and indicators in order to locate trade setups offering higher probability and a positive expected equity curve in the long-term.\n\nFundamental analysis: It is important to read and analyse before using data, statements, and news to make assessments about supply and demand in future.\n\nWave analysis: Lastly, you have to analyse price patterns on the chart. By doing this, you can not only understand the context but also the market structure and you can also identify trading opportunities, if there are any.\n\nTime frames\n\nVery low charts like 1 to 5 minutes charts are used by scalpers.\n\nLow timeframes like 15 to 60 minutes charts are used by intra-day traders.\n\nMid-low charts like 1 hour to 4 hours charts are used by intra-week traders.\n\nMiddle timeframes like 4 hours and daily charts are used by swing traders.\n\nHigher timeframes like weekly or monthly charts are used by long-term traders.\n\nBest Places for Trading Oil\n\nIQ Option is one of the best brokers to trade oil.

{"text": "National basic income could quickly cut Canadian poverty in half: budget watchdogIn its estimate, the parliamentary budget officer (PBO) used parameters in Ontario's 2017 basic-income pilot project, which was later cancelled by the Ford government.\n\nA single person would get up to $16,989 a year and a couple would get $24,027.\n\nDisabled Canadians would receive a $6,000 top-up. The more someone earns, the less he or she would receive, at a rate of $0.50 for every dollar earned.\n\nProviding Canadians a basic income could cut poverty by almost half in 2022, based on the federal poverty line.\n\nThe decrease would be most felt in Manitoba and Quebec, where 60 per cent fewer people would find themselves living below the poverty line.\n\nIn Ontario, poverty would decrease by 49 per cent, close to the national average. In Newfoundland and Labrador, it would fall the least, by 13.5 per cent.\n\nCanadians in the lowest income quintile would benefit the most, with disposable household incomes increasing by $4,535, or 17.5 per cent.\n\nMeanwhile, the disposable household incomes of Canadians in the third, fourth, and fifth income quintiles would fall by at least $1,371.\n\nIn total, the disposable income of 6.4 million Canadians would go up under a basic income program. However, it would fall for about 16.8 million people, due largely to the loss of tax credits, such as the basic personal amount.\n\nThe increase among the lowest income quintile would be felt most acutely in Manitoba, where disposable incomes would increase by $6,094, or 23.7 per cent.\n\nElsewhere, the household disposable incomes of the lowest quintile in Ontario would go up by 20 per cent, or $5,369. In Prince Edward Island, the average disposable income would increase by $2,966, or 11.4 per cent.\n\nHowever, the guaranteed basic income's effect on labour supply would be \"small,\" the PBO wrote.\n\nThe reduction in hours worked ranges from a high of 1.5 per cent in Nova Scotia to a low of 0.7 per cent in Alberta. Similarly, payroll costs would fall by 1.3 per cent nationally.\n\nBehavioural changes, such as employees working fewer hours, would increase the program's costs by more than $3 billion a year, however.\n\nThe idea of a basic income has grown in popularity, especially during the pandemic, which proponents say has exposed major flaws in Canada's social safety net.\n\nThe Green Party has endorsed a guaranteed livable income, while the NDP has voiced its support for a basic income pilot in P.E.I.\n\nAt their convention starting Friday, New Democrats will debate a resolution to implement a guaranteed basic income in Canada.\n\nThe Trudeau government has set a goal to cut the 2015 poverty level in half by 2030. Ottawa managed to reduce poverty by 30 per cent in 2019, surpassing its target to cut it by 20 per cent in 2020, according to federal figures.\n\nNot everyone is on board, though. An expert panel appointed by the B.C. government concluded last January that \"moving to a system (with) a basic income for all as its main pillar is not the most just policy option.\" It would be too costly, and wouldn't necessarily help the non-financial problems that cause people to need money in the first place, the report said.\n\nInstead, the panel says the B.C. government should bring in improvements and targeted actions, including a basic income for certain vulnerable groups.\n\nThe federal deficit is expected to reach $363.4 billion in 2020-21, the PBO said last week.", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "1f118304-6d19-4909-a132-f405ed849f3e", "url": "https://basicincometoday.com/national-basic-income-could-quickly-cut-canadian-poverty-in-half-budget-watchdog/"}

{"text": "What Is LTE\n\nLTE is the abbreviation for Long Term Evolution, and is a technology protocol for mobile wireless high speed data communications. LTE is specified, designed, developed and standardized by the Third Generation Partnership Project, or 3GPP for short.\n\nLTE was first officially launched in in late 2009 and the first live networks were launched in Norway and Sweden. In other parts of the world by Dec 2014, South Korea had the most advanced LTE network in the world.\n\nLTE Advanced (or LTE A) is the next major step in the evolution of LTE networks. It's a enhanced version of the LTE network technology that's expected to both help the massive increases in mobile data demand, and deliver much higher data speeds for all. That means better coverage, greater stability, and faster performance.\n\nLTE is sometimes known as \"4G LTE\" or \"4G\" depending on the country and the mobile network provders marketing. The \"4G LTE\" term has been used because a number of mobile network carriers used \"4G\" to name wireless protocols that were really 3.5G (HSPA+ or WiMax) for marketing reasons. This is mainly a marketing tactic that started in America, but you may find the same terminology used elsewhere.\n\nLTE Categories\n\nIn order to differentiate between several LTE evolutions, the industry is using different LTE Categories to describe the LTE network capabilities of both the networks themselves and the hardware (mobile phones, modems etc) that can connect. There are 11 different categories that are defined, and from a external perspective, they mainly differ in terms of theoretical speed.\n\nUser equipment category\n\nMax Download datarate\n\nMax. number of MIMO connections\n\nMax Upload datarate\n\n3GPP release\n\nCategory 0\n\n1.0 Mbit/s\n\n1\n\n1.0 Mbit/s\n\nRelease 12\n\nCategory 1\n\n10.3 Mbit/s\n\n1\n\n5.2 Mbit/s\n\nRelease 8\n\nCategory 2\n\n51.0 Mbit/s\n\n2\n\n25.5 Mbit/s\n\nRelease 8\n\nCategory 3\n\n102.0 Mbit/s\n\n2\n\n51.0 Mbit/s\n\nRelease 8\n\nCategory 4\n\n150.8 Mbit/s\n\n2\n\n51.0 Mbit/s\n\nRelease 8\n\nCategory 5\n\n299.6 Mbit/s\n\n4\n\n75.4 Mbit/s\n\nRelease 8\n\nCategory 6\n\n301.5 Mbit/s\n\n2 or 4\n\n51.0 Mbit/s\n\nRelease 10\n\nCategory 7\n\n301.5 Mbit/s\n\n2 or 4\n\n102.0 Mbit/s\n\nRelease 10\n\nCategory 8\n\n2,998.6 Mbit/s\n\n8\n\n1,497.8 Mbit/s\n\nRelease 10\n\nCategory 9\n\n452.2 Mbit/s\n\n2 or 4\n\n51.0 Mbit/s\n\nRelease 11\n\nCategory 10\n\n452.2 Mbit/s\n\n2 or 4\n\n102.0 Mbit/s\n\nRelease 11\n\nCategory 11\n\n603.0 Mbit/s\n\n2 or 4\n\n51.0 Mbit/s\n\nRelease 12\n\nCategory 12\n\n603.0 Mbit/s\n\n2 or 4\n\n102.0 Mbit/s\n\nRelease 12\n\nCategory 13\n\n391.6 Mbit/s\n\n2 or 4\n\n153.0 Mbit/s\n\nRelease 12\n\nCategory 14\n\n391.6 Mbit/s\n\n2 or 4\n\n102.0 Mbit/s\n\nRelease 12\n\nCategory 15\n\n3,916.6 Mbit/s\n\n8\n\n1,497.8 Mbit/s\n\nRelease 12\n\nNote that these speeds are maximum theoretical numbers, which are used to compare the maximum potential of the technology under ideal conditions\n\nThe modems Icomera uses in it's products are normally Category 3 at this time - (Models include the MC7304/7354 for example).\n\nLTE Bands and compatibility\n\nAlthough the core LTE technology is very similar worldwide, each country has allocated different bands (frequencies) for wireless carriers to carry LTE data. Unfortunately this is very messy for mobile devices like phones and modems, and very much unlike WiFi, which uses the same radio frequency worldwide. 3G was also much less fragmented from that point of view.\n\nThe proliferation of LTE bands is mostly due to governments worldwide rushing to auction radio frequencies, without a global perspective. In the rush, there are now 44 LTE Bands to be concerned about. On top of that, LTE has split into two families, FDD (frequency division duplex) and TDD (time division duplex), which are not compatible.\n\nEach device will have a specification as to which bands it can work with which is why Icomera needs to understand where in the world your vehicles will operate so that we can ensure they have the correct modems on board to handle the relevevant countries bands in and around your area.\n\nA list of country and bands by mobile network provider is maintained on Wikipedia and can be found here.", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "12d50104-d3c4-4e4e-9343-e9f720ce87e3", "url": "https://academy.icomera.com/academy/index.php/knowledge-base/useful-information/what-is-lte"}
{"text": "Avoid Salmonella This Holiday\n\nWith Thanksgiving just two days away, I'm sure many of us can already smell the turkey and taste the stuffing and potatoes. While I'm sure everyone is prepared to make a delicious feast and has all of their spices and garnishes ready, there is one thing that you shouldn't overlook this holiday…….salmonella. Needless to say, a case of salmonella poisoning can destroy an otherwise perfect Thanksgiving. Luckily, our friends at The Clean Team, have some tips on how to avoid a salmonella outbreak this holiday. So, read up, and have a safe and happy holiday. Happy Thanksgiving! Gobble Gobble!\n\nDon't Serve Up Salmonella This Holiday Season\n\nYou may feel confident when cooking up that bird and seasoning those veggies, but do you know how to avoid serving up deadly dose of kitchen bacteria like salmonella? According to the Center For Disease Control, over 40,000 people each year get salmonella poisoning. However, with these simple steps, salmonella can be avoided.\n\nWhen you set raw meat on counter tops, you create a harbinger of bacteria. Wipe up meat juices with a paper towel, spray the counter with an anti-bacterial cleaner (mix your own solution of 1 part bleach, 10 parts water for example), and wipe clean with another paper towel. Don't use a dish cloth for this job; it's not worth risking someone washing the dishes or the table with this contaminated cloth.\n\nUse two cutting boards when cutting up meat and veggies – one for the meat, a different one for the veggies – washing cutting boards carefully with hot soapy water between uses. Never cut raw vegetables on the meat cutting board.\n\nAvoid cleaning up raw meat juices with a sponge since germs get trapped in the sponge, creating a breeding ground for bacteria. And if you do get raw meat juices in your sponge, rinse in hot soapy water, then microwave the sponge for one minute. Be careful when removing; let it cool to the touch first.\n\nAfter handling raw meat, be sure and wash your hands vigorously with warm soapy water for at least one minute. And be careful to clean up under those long acrylic fingernails, as they can be completely missed during hand washing.\n\nWash all utensils that touch raw meat, like platters or plates, with hot soapy water before placing the cooked meat back on.\n\nStore raw meat on the lower shelf of the fridge, and raw vegetables on the higher shelves, to protect against mean drips or spills contaminating those raw veggies.\n\nServe up a safe, healthy meal during the holidays with just a little attention to proper clean up and food handling.", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "c6bafbb7-f299-4e8b-af89-869b6fde2212", "url": "https://www.cleanconscience.com/blog/2013/11/avoid-salmonella-this-holiday/"}

{"text": "Revenge and Justice\n\nIt seems I write mostly about revenge. All my characters are exacting some kind of revenge. Or think they are.\n\nYet I feel ambivalent about it.\n\nIs revenge justice?\n\nIt can feel that way. But it's a retributive justice. A justice that retaliates.\n\nAnd it always seems to cost something. Mattie, in True Grit, loses an arm. A character in my novel loses his life. And my protagonist emerges at the end as something less than human, unfeeling, remorseless.\n\nSo if I can come up with one problem with revenge, it's that I imagine it's hard to commit without losing some of that empathy so essential to our humanity. How can a person—once victimized—re-enter the perpetrator-victim dynamic and this time adopt the role of perpetrator? And how can this not jeopardize her sense of shared humanity, of empathy, of compassion?\n\nI understand how this role reversal—from victim to perpetrator—works in fiction and myth and fairy tales. It's satisfying. Even reassuring. Telling such stories, I can believe that justice (if revenge is justice) is possible and within my own hands. Transformed from powerless to powerful, from object to agent, I can act out my revenge fantasies in fiction. Safe from the negative consequences.\n\nAnd one of those consequences is that revenge tears the social fabric as violently as the original crime it is meant to obliterate. Blot out.\n\nAs if, by snuffing out another life, however badly lived, you can snuff out the consequences of that life. The aftermath of the original crime. The pain of it. And the rage that someone got away with it.\n\nBut revenge offers no healing power for society. It is vigilantism. Individualism carried to its extreme. And it is, I believe, inherently destructive.\n\nBecause revenge is all about the past and, the avenger imagines, making the perpetrator feel accountable for it.\n\nBut this is a fallacy.\n\nRevenge imagines no future and takes none into account. Its obsession with history blinds it to what is and is not possible. Revenge attempts to engage the past, amend it, even compensate for it.\n\nWhen, as hateful as that past may be, it is already over and done. We have moved past it. Time has pushed us forward, and there is little that can be done about an event behind us.\n\nBut if I find revenge so destructive, so full of death for all involved—why write about it?\n\nOf course there's the wishful thinking of a child's fairy tale, the desire for an orderly world, a moral one. But there's something more than that, too.\n\nThe imagination is a powerful tool. It reinvents the world, makes it fill whatever size and shape a fiction writer can dream up—\n\nSo why write about such darkness? Some of my characters, in the end, redeem themselves. Or try to. They try to accept, a few even to forgive. Others are swallowed up by it.\n\nI guess the easy answer is that you can have no light without darkness, no story without the tension between opposites—nothing good without struggle and resistance and suffering.\n\nAnd if I am honest, not everyone emerges from that darkness the better for it. As Hemingway famously said, \"The world breaks everyone…But those that will not break it kills.\"\n\nGore Vidal said that writers are compulsive \"truth-tellers,\" and I don't think I'll get far as a writer by trying to pretty things up, struggling against my natural self and the truths I want to tell.", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "2d788b43-4cbb-4208-b248-b65e872a09c2", "url": "https://mceaston.com/2013/01/22/revenge-and-justice/"}

{"text": "Blog\n\nAn electronic cigarette is basically an electronic device which mimics traditional cigarette smoking. It usually includes a device similar to a pen, a battery, an atomizer, and an incident such as a cartridge or bottle. Rather than tobacco, the smoker inhales nicotine instead. Therefore, the smoker is known as to be \"smoking\" when using an e-cigarette.\n\nThe e-cigarette has two main benefits: it reduces the risks of cancer along with other diseases caused by tobacco also it prevents the smoker from acquiring nasty diseases such as for example gum disease and oral cancers. But do remember that these benefits only arise if smokers actually use e-cigs. Should they do not, they're still at an increased risk from the harmful toxins within the tar and nicotine found in tobacco smoke. To give you a better knowledge of what I am attempting to say, let us check out many of the most addictive substances found in cigarettes: nicotine, propylene glycol, ammonia, gums, and polish. The tar and nicotine alone are highly addictive.\n\nThe bottom line is, e-cigs are a more convenient and healthier option. In addition they produce fewer health effects in comparison to traditional cigarettes. But why is them even more appealing is they also help smokers quit the habit. You do not need to exert any effort at all in order to quit smoking with these e-cigs. All you need to do is simply put them on the mouth area and breathe gently as you normally do.\n\nIn the meantime, the best thing concerning the latest innovation in smoking cessation technology is that it is not yet regulated by the FDA (Food and Drug Administration). That will not mean, however, that it is unsafe. On the contrary, there are many manufacturers out there that are constantly improving their products. In line with the FDA, they are aware of several reports submitted by various stakeholders (e.g. state governments podsmall and non-profit organizations) regarding possible threats posed by vaporizing nicotine and so are constantly working towards creating further regulations.\n\nOne way of showing your opposition to nicotine and never have to use actual cigarettes is to use e-cigs. E-cigs contain much less nicotine than the original cigarettes. But even so, they can still trigger the same biological responses within your body that you would get addicted to nicotine. It is simple to get addicted to anything, if you take it excessively.\n\nIf you smoke, you probably know that it is hard to quit smoking when you are constantly surrounded by individuals who smoke. Even when you have your own e-cigarette, you will have the urge to smoke every once in awhile. However, if you want to successfully quit smoking once and for all, you should employ it less and lessen how often you smoke while you use your e-cigs.\n\nThe next of the tobacco and chemical compounds risks e-cigs pose to your wellbeing is related to the chemical composition of the liquid. Once you smoke a cigarette, you inhale several harmful substances such as an extremely addictive substance, which means that people use e-cigs to get hooked to this drug. However, despite the fact that the drug is quite addicting, there is a possibility that one could break the addiction with enough effort and determination.", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "1cbb5db8-8020-44e3-81f4-43f507eeabf8", "url": "https://carter901.sijilmassapress.com/2021/05/e-cigarette-and-chemical-substances-risks-can-e-cigarettes-cause-serious-lung-damage/"}
{"text": "Women and the Arab world's glass ceiling\n\nThe 'third billion' in the Arab world\n\nBased on figures from the International Labor Organization (ILO), at least 90 million women in the Middle East and North Africa are today part of what has been called the \"Third Billion\", which is the approximate number of women worldwide who will be claiming their place as employees, producers and entrepreneurs in the global economy by 2030.\n\nUntil now, these women have been excluded from economic empowerment by either lack of opportunities or insufficient preparedness. Projected to number around 865 million by 2020, most of these women live in emerging and developing nations. The impact of this geographically dispersed group will be so large — equivalent to that of the billion-plus populations of China and India — that they have been dubbed the Third Billion.\n\nThe Third Billion was calculated by combining the forecast for \"not prepared\" and/or \"not enabled\" women globally between the ages of 20 and 65 in 2020. \"Prepared\" refers to having received a sufficient education, usually secondary school. Opportunities for basic education and literacy are prerequisites to women's economic empowerment. \"Enabled\" refers to having sufficient social and political support to engage with the labor market. This support spans family, logistical, legal, and financial parameters.\n\nThe MENA's missing share\n\nIt is not surprising that more than 10 percent, or about double of the region's share in world population, of the Third Billion live in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region. The World Bank places the female labor force participation rate in the MENA at just 26 percent, the lowest of any region globally. Although women have achieved equal, or better, education levels compared to men in most MENA countries, they are not making similar gains at work.\n\nIn entrepreneurship, too, women have not caught up. The World Bank estimates that women own just 20 percent of MENA companies, compared to 32 percent in countries from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), and 39 percent percent in Latin America and the Caribbean.\n\nWomen must have the freedom to participate in the workforce and ultimately advance to senior positions to reach their economic potential. They should have the same opportunities as men to start their own companies. As long as women have limited economic opportunities, Middle Eastern countries will be unable to join the modern global economy.\n\nThe World Bank argues if rates of female participation in the labor force increased to levels predicted by women's education, age, and fertility, average household earnings would increase by as much as 25 percent. For many families, that is the ticket to the middle class. If female participation rates had been at these predicted levels, per capita gross domestic product growth rates might have been up to 35 percent higher, according to the World Bank.\n\nEntrenched gender roles\n\nThe environment in Egypt, the Middle East's most populous country, is fluid. Women organized in a remarkable way during and after the 2011 revolution. They have since been vocal in demanding new reforms and have sought to defend previous social and economic gains. While the near-term in Egypt is hard to predict, what is clear is that Egyptian women are underrepresented in the workforce. The female participation rate was just 24 percent in 2010. Egyptian women cluster in a few sectors: agriculture, education, public administration, health and social work.\n\nSome governments are attempting to redress the economic and workplace balance to assist female participation. Saudi Arabia is trying to integrate women into the workforce at a pace that balances economic needs with social norms. Legislation on workplace requirements is evolving to allow women and men in the same facility. Oftentimes, however, the legacies of old laws and traditions prevent female participation. There is a strong feeling within the private sector that it can be simpler for companies to retain all-male workforces than to pay for buildings that accommodate mixed gender staffs or to tackle potential resistance to female workers.\n\nAs a result, although women constitute 57 percent of Saudi Arabia's university graduates, the participation rate of female nationals was just 12 percent in 2009. Women in the workforce often congregate in the public sector, despite government encouragement of a more vibrant, inclusive private sector. Women tend to focus on education and health because of gender perceptions and the lack of career guidance.\n\nWhile each country has unique challenges, several approaches can apply regionally. To this end, Booz & Company has created the Third Billion Index, which ranks 128 developing and developing countries. The index highlights how countries have fostered economic opportunities for women, and where they can improve. To make the index relevant for ranked countries, we offer concrete recommendations. For MENA countries in particular, we see great potential in following these recommendations.\n\nHow to advance women\n\nThe first recommendation is for government-private sector partnerships to draw women into the workforce. Experience demonstrates that government mandates alone will not be effective. Forcing women into work without the necessary skills and workplace policies will damage productivity and could create an employer backlash.\n\nAt the same time, a clear official signal that female workforce integration is a priority can catalyze corporate commitment and investment. Together, government and enterprises can reinforce each other's desire to promote female inclusion.\n\nSecond, governments and companies that employ women should establish mentoring programs. Men already benefit from informal ties, the \"old boys' network.\" Mentoring programs can connect young women entering the workforce with successful women who have already broken in. We should not underestimate the power that role models, along with advice and encouragement from career women, can give to younger women entering the male-dominated workplace.\n\nAn example of such mentoring comes from the Prince Sultan Bin Abdul Aziz Fund for Women's Development. Over 1,300 women have gone through the fund's various training programs. Similarly, the fund has provided finance to 40 female entrepreneurs. The result of these initiatives is that women have gone on to start businesses and create more than 200 jobs. Women's business networks can also fill an important information gap on the economic status, education needs, and social roles of women. Governments, the private sector, and not-for-profits should collect this evidence-based data collaboratively. They can pool feedback to design high-impact programs.\n\nIn the United Arab Emirates, the Khalifa Fund in Abu Dhabi, Mohammed Bin Rashid Establishment for Young Business Leaders in Dubai, and Sharjah Tatweer Forum are providing such information — although their focus is not solely on women. Such organizations need to be better staffed and funded, have wider geographic coverage, and should network to share knowledge.\n\nThird, governments and companies should examine success stories and innovative methods of bringing women into the workforce.\n\nOne example is Bupa Arabia. The company, a provider of health insurance products and services in Saudi Arabia, has a 40 percent female staff after a decade's effort. The health insurance provider broke with stereotypes and partnered with the government to train women in job skills. By employing women in all departments — finance, human resources, information technology, operations, regulatory affairs and sales — the firm dispensed with the notion of \"women's work\" that elsewhere confines them to supporting roles. Indeed, the company now has an all-female telesales team. This is good business — female customers in the healthcare market prefer female sales agents.\n\nIn Kuwait, Lebanon, Morocco, and the UAE, there is now a corporate funded program called the Arab Women's Entrepreneurship Project. The project is run by AMIDEAST, a US educational institute. Funded by the Citi Foundation and leveraging the Cisco Entrepreneur Institute's training program, the Arab Women's Entrepreneurship Project will provide education and mentoring to 80 women entrepreneurs from disadvantaged backgrounds.\n\nFourth, companies and governments should turn social restrictions into opportunities for commerce and innovation. For example, Ataalam in Saudi Arabia has created a women's virtual learning environment to allow women to study from home. The company is a female-owned private venture that arose from a Saudi government-sponsored innovation incubator named \"BADIR.\"\n\nCombining these approaches can have an immediate impact on employment and skills building. Today, hard-working, high-profile women are chipping away at the \"cement ceiling\" and making it possible for others to do the same. Similarly, multi-sector cooperation will result in further success stories and role models that can alter mindsets and inspire young women. With more women at work, the Middle East can achieve its economic potential", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "e321939d-9097-42a5-9349-9e339dea54a2", "url": "https://www.executive-magazine.com/economics-policy/women-and-the-arab-worlds-glass-ceiling"}
{"text": "I tried to research but what I found is pretty limited. A very tiny but non zero percentage of primordial matter was Helium-3 or 3He.\n\nStars produce 3He as part of the proton-proton chain but they also consume 3He. It has about a 400 year half life in our sun. From Wikipedia.\n\nIn the Sun, each helium-3 nucleus produced in these reactions exists\nfor only about 400 years before it is converted into helium-4.[6] Once\nthe helium-3 has been produced, there are four possible paths to\ngenerate 4He\n\nMy question is 2-fold. Is the primordial amounts of 3He significant or insignificant compared to what stars produce and eject by coronal mass ejections or blowing up into nebulas, and are there specific stars, due to the internal heat and rate of reaction that product and eject more 3He into their mass ejections.\n\nFor example, would airless, rocky, magnetic field free worlds around red dwarfs be more saturated with 3He or would you find more around larger, hotter stars that undergo fusion faster. If I wanted to go He3 mining, would I set my ship to a red dwarf system or a blue star system or a nebula?\n\nIt's not for a book or anything, I'm just personally curious, as 3He is potentially very useful stuff.\n\nI'm aware that primordial isn't particularly easy to collect, as anything gaseous and primordial would spread out and only collect in large gravity wells, gas giants or larger. But primordial 3He could, for example, exist in Jupiter or Saturn from formation, though the formation of their magnetic fields probably prevents them from absorbing any ejected from stars. Hence the primordial vs star ejected ratio and the type of star that produced the most question are somewhat related, so I thought one question rather than two, but I can split into two questions if desired.\n\n\"Early work [Bame, et al., 1979; Schwenn et al., 1980; and Zwickl et al., 1982] showed that He and heavier elements are overabundant in CMEs and there is enhanced He$^{+}$. Observations from the SWICS instrument on Ulysses revealed some compositional differences in CMEs, such as a high O$^{7+}/\\,$O$^{6+}$ ratio, indicating significant heating in the corona [Galvin,\n1997].\n\n...\n\nSWICS is especially well suited to measure solar wind $^4$He$^+$\nand the isotopic helium ratio, $^3$He$^{++}/\\,^4$He$^{++}$, as described by Gloeckler' and Geiss [1998a].\".\n\n2. are there specific stars, due to the internal heat and rate of reaction that product and eject more $^3$He into their mass ejections.\n\n4. D and $^3$He\nThe light isotope $^3$He is produced in large quantities in dwarf stars where the masses are not large enough for it to be destroyed by $^3$He ($^3$He, 2$p$) $^4$He. It is also the case that there is a class of stars in which it has been shown from measurements of the isotope shift that most of the helium in their atmospheres is $^3$He. These stars include 21 Aquilae, three Centaurus A, and several others (Burbidge & Burbidge 1956; Sargent & Jugaku 1961; Hartoog & Cowley 1979; Stateva, Ryabchikov, & Iliev 1998). The stars are peculiar A, F, and B stars having He/H abundances that are $\\sim \\frac{1}{10}$ of the normal helium abundance. The $^3$He$/\\,^4$He ratio can range from 2.7 to 0.5. These stars occupy narrow strip in the (log $g$, T$_{eff}$)-plane between the B stars with strong helium lines and those with weak helium lines that show no evidence for the presence of $^3$He. However, the detection of $^3$He from the isotope shift will fail if the $^3$He$/\\,^4$He ratio is $\\le$ 0.1. Thus, many of the weak helium-line stars may well have $^3$He$/\\,^4$He abundance ratios far higher than the abundance ratio that is normally assumed to be present, namely, $^3$He$/\\,^4$He $\\approx$ 2 x 10$^{-4}$.\n\nThe high abundance of $^3$He in these stars has been attributed by G. Michaud and his colleagues to diffusion (Michaud et al. 1979 and earlier references). Whether or not this is the correct explanation, what these results do tell us is that stellar winds from such stars will enrich the interstellar gas with He in large amounts. This $^3$He is in addition to the $^3$He that will be injected from dwarf stars. The final abundance required is $^3$He$/\\,$H $\\; \\approx \\;$ 2 x 10$^{-5}$. It has been argued by those who believe that $^3$He is a product of big bang nucleosynthesis that there has not been time to build up the required abundance by astrophysical processes.\n\nHowever, not only do we not know what the rate of injection from stars is, but in the QSSC, the timescale for all of this stellar processing is $\\sim 10^{11}$ rather than H$_0^{-1}$$\\approx$ 10$^{-10}$ yr. Thus, we believe that He may very well have been produced by stellar processes.\n\nOne early estimate of the primordial ratio of $^3$He to $^4$He in the solar nebula has been the measurement of their ratio in the atmosphere of Jupiter, measured by the mass spectrometer of the Galileo atmospheric entry probe. This ratio is about 1:10,000,$^{[43]}$ or 100 parts of $^3$He per million parts of $^4$He. This is roughly the same ratio of the isotopes as in lunar regolith, which contains 28 ppm helium-4 and 2.8 ppb helium-3 (which is at the lower end of actual sample measurements, which vary from about 1.4 to 15 ppb). However, terrestrial ratios of the isotopes are lower by a factor of 100, mainly due to enrichment of helium-4 stocks in the mantle by billions of years of alpha decay from uranium and thorium.\n\n$^3$He is a primordial substance in the Earth's mantle, considered to have become entrapped within the Earth during planetary formation. The ratio of $^3$He to $^4$He within the Earth's crust and mantle is less than that for assumptions of solar disk composition as obtained from meteorite and lunar samples, with terrestrial materials generally containing lower $^3$He$/\\,^4$He ratios due to ingrowth of $^4$He from radioactive decay.\n\n$^3$He has a cosmological ratio of 300 atoms per million atoms of $^4$He (at. ppm),$^{[44]}$ leading to the assumption that the original ratio of these primordial gases in the mantle was around 200-300 ppm when Earth was formed. A lot of $^4$He was generated by alpha-particle decay of uranium and thorium, and now the mantle has only around 7% primordial helium,$^{[44]}$ lowering the total 3He/4He ratio to around 20 ppm. Ratios of $^3$He$/\\,^4$He in excess of atmospheric are indicative of a contribution of $^3$He from the mantle. ...\".", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "65ca60b6-9574-4bea-8121-ae256be3e1bb", "url": "https://astronomy.stackexchange.com/questions/29936/what-percentage-of-helium-3-is-primordial-vs-produced-in-stars"}
{"text": "One of the things the ancient philosophers pondered was the impulse to look at a dead body near the city walls. Why are humans drawn to look at such a thing? What part of the self does that curiosity represent? Is it the need to confront our own mortality? Is it a morbid celebration of being alive? Is it even worse? A dark and violent impulse?\n\nThe need to look at the David Letterman mess seems to be a modern day equivalent of this ancient conundrum. What fascinates? Is it being surprised by the humanness of someone whose reclusive image runs counter to reports of connecting with co-workers? Is it that this is serious business and we think of him as someone who makes us laugh? Is it the revenge of wronged wives everywhere to want his head because he's wronged his longtime partner and new wife?\n\nOh, wait, it's none of these. It's our sanctified right to call someone a hypocrite because he has made sport of others who have colored outside of the moral lines while all the while making a mess in his own playpen.\n\nDon Imus called him a \"creep\" on the air recently. Give me a break.\n\nIn talking about this with a young friend, a 27-year-old woman, I was given a lesson. \"It's insulting,\" she said. \"To hear those women who worked with him might not have the judgment or self-respect to resist his advances — to hear they might have had sex with him because they worried about their jobs.\" She went on, \"They were most likely choosing to have sex with him because they wanted to. It doesn't matter if it was out of ambition, or lust or boredom or because they had heard that was what other women had done. The point is women want sex and power too, and they are just as misguided in how they go about getting it as men are.\"\n\nThat point of view is one worth looking at. We fought for our rights in the workplace, including the right to make the same stupid mistakes as men and to have the same bald ambitions. Why do we think, when a powerful man says he's had sex with a number of women who work for him, that their part of that equation involves being somehow blinded by the man's power?\n\nSo far we know that David Letterman was unfaithful to the mother of his son with a number of women who worked with him. Beyond that we know that he is a celebrity in a country where we love nothing more than celebrities. Maybe he thought that gave him a Get Out of Jail Free card. Maybe the women who didn't think about the sisterhood when they partnered with him thought that card applied to them too. It doesn't matter. What matters is that we keep our heads on straight now. The man has apologized at length and in public, and the alleged blackmailer has been given the message that threat doesn't trump the law.\n\nThis just may be a triumph for the Constitution, while it is an allegory about those who live under its protection. So far it's Citizen's Rights 1, Blackmail 0. Let's remember what game we're watching and how the score is keptThank you Pat.\nBy the way,I went to Hahneman hospital last Friday for orientation for anatomical drawing.We went through the basic proceedures and how to carefully wrap and explore and close the cadavers.\nOn the chalk board was written \"go eagles\" and perhaps the more enduring \"mortui vitae docens(sic my latin is rusty ),which as you know,translates as the \"dead will teach the living 'and they certainly did.\nI was reminded of the universality of all our forms and how important it was to respect each creature.You could draw a landscape copying the spinal vertebre or voluptuos intestines or a ghostly desert following the folds of the skin and larger muscle groups.I was reminded that as the moon and stars waxe and wane in their orbits that those stellar forms and rhythms are embedded in our in our human codes as well.\nIt was quite an evening.\nThe human figure is beautiful.\n\nAs a gynecologist I can certainly report from the front lines that women have extra marital affairs and enjoy affairs with married men even if they are single. The sexual appetites of women are just as varied as are those of men. So there was only one person who was harmed here and we need to leave that in the bedroom of the Letterman household.\n\nLetterman is just another guy with power and fame and happens to be funny and probably a lot of fun as well. Work environments often produce faux closeness that can easily lead to both emotional and physical intimacy.\n\nIt must be really hard to be in spotlight all the time and to be a target of stalking and kidnappying threats and blackmail.\n\nIt took Indiana courage to refuse to be blackmailed and now Letterman needs to stop talking to us about this and buy that lovely wife a great piece of jewelry from Verdura. That would be a lovely piece of jewelry for a week for the next 52 weeks, Dave.", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "3f58d764-0280-4852-887d-a4c41d0ef46e", "url": "https://womensvoicesforchange.org/following-letterman-remember-the-name-of-the-game.htm"}

Chemical etching machining process is primarily used for making common precision medical parts. The machining system offers an excellent flexibility for creating precision medical tools with uncommon configuration also as metals with tight tolerance within .0005'. Apart from this, chemical etching machining is capable of producing small holes and bars that happen to be not attainable with other machining processes. Additionally, chemical etching machining uses state-of-the-art-CAD software enabled with ¼-mm resolution within the production process, which facilitates speedy and low price operations. The machining system is ideal for each prototype and production of big quantities of precision medical instruments.\n\nYet another approach called the metal stamping machining phenomenon, which can be also referred to as progressive die stamping or lengthy run metal stamping, is extensively used in production of precision medical equipment with thickness from .002' to .135'. The technique is primarily used for processing common low price tag parts which are formed into 3 dimensions. An additional common process is Wire Electrical-Discharge Machining (EDM) in which the metal is separated from a conductive work piece by suggests of electrical erosion. Throughout this process, the wire never ever touches the conductive work piece and leaves a path around the work piece, which is slightly larger than the wire.\n\nThe advancement in precision medical machining has supplied a substantial enhance towards the medical industry, as surgical procedures will need parts, that are designed with utmost perfection. Medical machining phenomenon has helped in manufacturing much better quality hospital tools, hence serving drastically to get a social lead to.", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "0adc3a43-2891-490a-94fa-dd0815e6ece2", "url": "https://www.techsite.io/p/2228937/t/medical-machining"}

{"text": "ST. LOUIS, MISSOURI. Anemia involves a lack of red blood cells (erythrocytes), or may be associated with a hemoglobin deficiency. A patient is classified as anemic if their hematocrit (packed red blood cell) level is below the normal range of 38-50% of total blood volume. In the USA it is estimated that 12% of people between the ages of 75 and 84 years, and 25% of people over the age of 85 years are anemic. Anemia is associated with increased mortality among patients with heart failure, chronic angina, and cancer. Researchers at the St. Louis School of Medicine now report that anemia also increases mortality and hospitalizations among elderly patients with atrial fibrillation (AF).\n\nTheir study involved 13,067 Medicare beneficiaries hospitalized with AF. Average age of the patients was 80 years and 58% were women. The group probably contained very few lone afibbers and no attempt was made to see if the conclusions of the study applied to them. More than half (57%) of the patients had heart failure, 37% had suffered a prior heart attack, 29% had a history of stroke or transient ischemic attacks (TIAs) while 25% had diabetes.\n\nDuring a 12-month period, 3665 (28%) of the patients died. After adjusting for all likely confounders the researchers observed that male afibbers with a hematocrit level of 45-49.9% had the lowest mortality and that men with a hematocrit level of less than 25% had twice the risk of dying than did men at the optimum level. The optimum hematocrit level for women was 40-44.9% and the risk of dying increased by 41% for a hematocrit level of less than 25%.\n\nAlso during the 12-month observation period 8364 study participants were re-admitted to hospital. After adjusting for likely confounding variables the researchers found that those with a hematocrit level in the 25-29.9% range had a 28% increased risk of re-hospitalization when compared to those in the 40-44.9% range.\n\nThey conclude that anemia is an independent predictor of all-cause mortality and re-hospitalization among elderly patients hospitalized with atrial fibrillation and suggest that clinical trials are needed to determine if correcting anemia (iron supplementation?) is effective and safe in patients with AF.\n\nEditor's comment: Although the findings of this study are unlikely to apply to the average lone afibber, it nevertheless points out the importance of maintaining an adequate hematocrit level, especially as one ages. Although Geritol (an iron tonic) used to be very popular among older people years ago, it has fallen out of favor based on medical advice that older people should avoid iron supplements. Will this advice ultimately turn out to be as \"ill-advised\" as the advice to avoid sun exposure? NOTE: People who suffer from hemochromatosis (iron overload) should not supplement with iron or vitamin C unless specifically advised to do so by their physician.\n\nI do have one major problem with this study that links low hematocrit levels in afibbers to increased mortality. How did the researchers account for the effect of warfarin and aspirin usage (over 80% of all study participants were on one of these two drugs)? While aspirin and warfarin would likely have been beneficial for those with prior heart attack and stroke, both cause significant micro-bleeding which would certainly be a highly plausible cause for the high prevalence of anemia observed in the study", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "78a1726f-a483-41e1-9e40-100b45f144a7", "url": "https://database.afibbers.org/database/risk_factors/anemia-and-atrial-fibrillation"}
{"text": "An OFRR is free and confidential and focused on finding solutions\n\nPUBLISHED ON July 11, 2021 (USDA, Flickr/Creative Commons)\n\nJACKSON, Mich. — Growers who have already attended a FSMA Produce Safety Training have an idea of what the Produce Safety Rule is all about, but many find it challenging to apply what they learned to practices on their own farms. To support growers through this challenge, Michigan State University Extension and the Michigan Produce Safety Technicians have teamed up to provide growers with a free and confidential produce safety consultation called an On-Farm Readiness Review (OFRR). This low stress walk-through also helps a grower gauge how ready they are for a Produce Safety Inspection with the Michigan Department of Agriculture and Rural Development. Growers sometimes feel they need to have things \"perfect\" before they schedule an OFRR, but that is not necessary! An On-Farm Readiness Review is meant to help growers focus their efforts on the things the law requires and then identify other best food safety practices that are important, but not requisite.\n\nAnother piece of good news is that an OFRR is free and confidential and focused on finding solutions! Michigan growers do not need to tackle produce safety alone; the Michigan On-Farm Produce Safety (MIOFPS) team is here to help!\n\nP.S. Although not required, attending a FSMA Produce Safety Alliance Grower Training prior to completing an On-Farm Readiness Review is highly recommended. These 8-hour courses are offered online by both The Michigan On-Farm Produce Safety Team and The Produce Safety Alliance. This training course provides growers with a copy of the FSMA Produce Safety laws and introduces key concepts that the Produce Safety Rule regulates. For those growers who must comply with these laws, this training also fulfills the education requirement outlined in sub section 112.22(c) which requires that \"at least one supervisor or responsible party for your farm must have successfully completed food safety training at least equivalent to that received under standardized curriculum recognized as adequate by the Food and Drug Administration.\"", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "e52a096a-8178-4588-a0a0-78b0b7521afb", "url": "https://www.morningagclips.com/on-farm-readiness-reviews-help-michigan-produce-growers-with-fsma-produce-safety-sompliance/"}

{"text": "Currently the TrainerRoad outside workout .FIT file defines lap power as the target type for the Garmin default workout page. Here is an example, where lap power is \"Step Avg. Pwr.\" at the top of the screen:\n\nThis is not very useful, and workouts from Garmin Connect and TrainingPeaks use 3-sec Power as shown here:\n\nI would recommend creating a second workout screen and just ignoring the default for the time being. I don't find the visuals particularly compelling or effective myself even if a 3s power was made available. I really like my second screen however, I have everything I need at a glance. TR has created a tutorial for this as well.\n\nThe default Garmin workout page is compelling for me. All about focus and being in 'the zone' (mental) without distractions.\n\nI've posted soooo many custom screens on the forum over the last year. Seriously. I've been using Garmin to do outside workouts since 2016, first with the 520 and then 530. Previously a heavy user of creating workouts in Garmin Mobile, TrainingPeaks, and a bit in TR's WorkoutCreator.\n\nCurrently I have a coach and workouts are assigned in TrainingPeaks and I don't have any issues, everything works very well pre-ride, during ride, post-ride. The TP UI could use a facelift but honestly there are too many features for me to give it up and commit to using TrainerRoad even if I dropped my coach.\n\nI'd like to see TR up its outside workout game (pre- and during- and post-), for the day I go back to self-coaching.\n\nFailing to see how this is mutually exclusive to my statement. In the interim, you could create a functional screen that does exactly what your asking for. The flex isn't necessary. Garmin workout screen that has the same key visuals and simplicity in the short term.\n\nTR is all about the user experience. Why create something that should simply work out of the box? If lap power was so important it would be front and center of the Desktop and Mobile apps. Its not, and for good reason. Same applies for running workouts on Garmin.\n\nI totally get it. I think for people roaming around and dissatisfied, the custom solution works and might even be better, I like HR as a sanity check for instance. I think Garmin's default workout screen that can't be overridden is crap. TR missed on the redunt step average field for sure, you can see at a glance how you track on the comparison graph which is more valuable than a number for sure. But Garmin should let you populate your own custom workout screen that would apply to any platform's workout. I'm a garmin die hard, but sometimes they piss me right off.\n\nI think this is a no brainer. I didn't even notice the target type for a while the first time I was using the field and was all confused by the data I was seeing. I am also relatively technology impaired with a cheap cell phone and no functional computer (damn right I have an 830 an Fenix 6 though!), so that probably doesn't help.\n\nI get your point. It really just needs another field. In comparison to all the apps, which has immediate/3s power, lap power, etc. There are fields missing.\n\nBut, just wanted to point out that it is there. It's just that you prefer to see the 3s power instead of where you are relative to the target. So, in essence you could come up short on the interval but have 3s be in range.\n\nThanks. You left off the real-time power graph in that pic. Look at it from a design point-of-view, what information is given the most pixels? Ok now shrink it down to the size of a Garmin 530. Why should interval power be given pixels on a tiny screen, at the expense of knowing 3 or 10 second power and seeing that in a red/yellow/green target RANGE? Outside you can't precisely hit a target power number, not much value in that if you can keep the dancing triangle in the green and yellow ranges.\n\n(somewhat off-topic: it took many workouts before I figured out the meaning of the TR app's bar/ball)\n\nIts like Alex said on the podcast recently (paraphrasing), if you put interval power on a bike computer and due to traffic/terrain you are low, then quite often the first reaction is to go well over the target RANGE in order to make lap power get back into a proper range.\n\nyeah, I did. Is it relevant, for highlighting that interval target is front and center?\n\nbbarrera:\n\nWhy should interval power be given pixels on a tiny screen, at the expense of knowing 3 or 10 second power and seeing that in a red/yellow/green target RANGE?\n\nI can kind of see the momentary power, in the power-graph, as you mentioned. But, it's a coarse graph. I can see when I'm close, and I can see when I'm not.\n\nI'd think in some cases it's the target, and other cases it's not. But, given that Garmin hasn't exposed a way to specify 4 fields instead of 3, which is the priority? I think it varies on the scenario.\n\nbbarrera:\n\nif you put interval power on a bike computer and due to traffic/terrain you are low, then quite often the first reaction is to go well over the target RANGE in order to make lap power get back into a proper range.\n\nI think the argument of being well over the range to make up for it, is dependent on the duration of the interval and how far under you are.\n\nTo extrapolate the emphasis being placed on that argument (\"well over the target RANGE\"), my guess is that you're saying target is not important for a long interval and you can drift under the target, and that rest breaks in the interval are OK. It could be traffic lights, or it could be that you're tired and need to stop (and fill out the survey that it was traffic lights. ).\n\nI'd guess that interval power is one of the metrics being used to determine if you pass/fail the workout. Just like if you stop in the middle of a VO2 interval. Fail. Stop in Z2, don't care.\n\nInterpretation of the interval target, and reaction to the target, is what you're arguing about in the latter posts. I get that. I still think it's an either/or scenario, and varies. You might want 3s, someone else may want the interval range. On a VO2 power interval, I'd want to see my lap power. 3s doesn't really cut it there, IMO, as it's probably going all over the place. Maybe I want 10s or 30s, if it must be some form of instant power.\n\nI get that, but that's not the point I am making in a selected response to you. That was that it is not on any of the apps. My point is that it is on the apps. Nothing more than that.\n\nThere's no need to move the goal posts and to try and convince me. I'm pretty rational about it, and would just make another screen as I see the value of both. It's situational.\n\nyeah, I did. Is it relevant, for highlighting that interval target is front and center?\n\nWithout trying to beat a dead horse I think @bbarrera is correct on this.\n\nI get that the average interval target is \"front and center\" but the \"measured average interval power\" is only secondary on the TR app - the actual numerical value shown is that of current power - not average. The numerical power on the default garmin screen when a TR workout is loaded is the average - so there is indeed an inconsistency there.\n\nOf course it would be nice if we could just configure the default workout screen ourselves…", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "ffe7bbc2-8fe9-49f7-883e-d77d3bb8845d", "url": "https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/feature-request-3s-power-on-garmin-default-workout-page/59864"}

As a member of the Minnesota Student Association, he is advocating to make the U of M a place where all students can succeed. After graduation, he hopes to use virtual reality to create even more positive change in the world.\n\nWhy did you choose to study computer science at the University of Minnesota?\n\nIn high school, I was part of a STEM program at the University of Minnesota, which was an amazing experience! I had the opportunity to tour labs, get hands-on with some of the available tools, learn about current research, and meet students in a wide range of majors. During this program, I fell in love with the location and culture on campus. The U of M also has an excellent computer science program, which was perfect for me as an incoming freshman interested in research and unsure of what I wanted to do in the future.\n\nHow did you become interested in computer science?\n\nFor a long time now, I have had a goal for my life: to create positive change in the world. My interest in computer science was first sparked in high school when I began taking programming classes. I found I was very passionate about it and was amazed by the versatility and freedom it offered as a creative medium. I also recognized the opportunities it presented and the increasing ease of reaching individuals worldwide. From this point forward, I knew I wanted to study computer science and spent a lot of time learning all I could about different career paths and how I could use what I learn to help people.\n\nYou've spent the last two years working as an automotive technician. Does this position have any aspect that contributes to your interest in computer science?\n\nI spent most of my time working independently on multiple-day repairs, taking breaks now and then to do quick maintenance on a car that would come in. While I was there, I found many similarities between the work I was doing and computer science. Car repair is done similarly to how an algorithm executes instructions, there is an order and a flow to it. When repairing a car, you take parts out in a certain order, remove the broken part, replace it with a new part, then put all the pieces back together in a specific order. As I got into more complex repairs, I was introduced to another level of car repair. These repairs required me to diagnose computer-related problems. This was interesting to me because I had never seen the code which ensured certain systems in a car ran. What struck me was that these programs were mostly safety-related, such as vehicle/weather sensing and engine problems, and they are becoming more and more difficult to understand without some type of hands-on experience with computers.\n\nWhat will you be working on at your upcoming internship at Metavention?\n\nI will be working as a software engineer intern. I am very excited for the opportunity and am looking forward to working with the team on their Integrated Radio Frequency Denervation System to facilitate hepatic denervation. This is a unique treatment aimed at permanently disrupting overactive sympathetic nerves which may result in improved blood sugar control, reduced blood pressure and improvement in other metabolic diseases.\n\nHow did you become a student Senator for the Minnesota Student Association?\n\nWhen the University went online in the spring of 2020, it was a difficult shift for a lot of students. After hearing about the role the student senate played in ensuring an easier transition, I jumped at the opportunity to run in the next election. I wanted to contribute to making the U a more accessible and inclusive place for everyone. As we move back into in-person classes, I hope to to be a voice for those who have benefited from new resources and practices put in place for online learning to ensure a smooth transition to normalcy for everyone.\n\nWhat advice do you have for incoming computer science students?\n\nWork with other people as much as you can. Networking and collaborating on projects will open you up to new opportunities. Also, don't get discouraged during the hard parts of the learning process. You will have ups and downs, but what you'll find is that, long-term, there will be an upward slope to mastery as you learn more things!\n\nWhat are your plans after graduation?\n\nAfter graduation, I would like to pursue work that combines virtual reality with artificial intelligence or machine learning. I believe virtual reality has great potential to create a more accessible and inclusive world if navigated correctly. Eventually, I would like to start my own company in this field!", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "85db5ae0-0f63-4352-9424-4563f95419ad", "url": "https://cse.umn.edu/cs/news/cspotlight-striving-positive-change"}
{"text": "4 tips for summer skin care\n\nSummer is about to arrive and it is important to remember that skin care changes with the seasons. Skin is one of the main organs of our body and that's why it's important to take care of it in the best way. Permanently in contact with the outside, the skin is susceptible to various external aggressions and can resent the changes in our routines or simply the weather changes.Thus, from season to season, the need our skin evokes changes substantially, and it is necessary to understand its needs and adapt the care with it to the spaces we frequent and the time we spend outside. In summer, temperatures tend to rise and, with this change, the most common is that they begin to frequent beaches and pools.\n\nSubject to sun exposure, sea salt and water treatment products such as chlorine, the skin tends to resent, and may become drier and less healthy.Thus, with the approach of the hot months, it becomes essential to question how we can treat our skin to ensure an appealing result and to ensure your health.Learn 4 tips to care for your skin in the summer months.\n\nTip 1: Bet on good moisturizersThe\n\nuse of moisturizers for the skin is always important but during the summer it becomes even more fundamental. A well moisturized skin will look better, avoiding dryness and eventual flaking, and be less prone to skin diseases. The choice of quality products, preferably natural, is the most suitable. This is an example of a brand that allows the encounter with excellent moisturizers, totally vegan.\n\nTip 2: Bet on sun protectionThe\n\napplication of a sunscreen is very important to ensure the health of your skin during the summer.\n\nIf possible, to avoid sunburn and possible health problems (such as skin cancer or melanoma, for example) prefer the sun filters with SPF greater than 30 and choose those that offer UVA and UVB protection.\n\nTip 3: Eat well\n\nIt is\n\nnot\n\nonly in the application of products that skin health is guaranteed. In fact, food plays a key role in ensuring that the skin remains healthy and beautiful during the summer. Try to eat fruits and bet on foods rich in carotenoids such as papaya, carrot or beet. These will help to give your skin a more caring and luminous look while keeping it healthy.\n\nTip 4: Hydrate yourselfWater\n\nis key to keeping your skin healthy, as several international studies have proven.According to the evidence found by several scientific studies, drinking water promotes hydration of the skin from the inner layers, helps to disguise and prevent the formation of wrinkles, reduces cellulite and prevents premature aging.Thus, good hydration during the summer months can help keep your skin healthier and more beautiful even in the face of external aggression.\n\nMore Articles\n\nLosing weight has become one of the main goals for women around the world, especially in the summer season. The bikini operation is over, but this does not mean that it is not a good time to continue losing that extra weight and reduce the fat.\n\nThe world has never had such a rapid advance as the one we have seen over the last decades. If it is true that appearance has always been important and that the way people present themselves to others is strongly linked to social, cultural and economic issues; it is also true that the ways in which this presentation is made today depend on renewed aspects and with new intricacies and applications.Mixing physical aspects and adornments, the new trends for appearance end up being strongly anchored in digital logics and finding, in the various technological and scientific innovations, the formulas that allow their permanent evolution.", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "d546dc8f-1226-4868-8525-44de7e1179e5", "url": "https://www.mortars.ca/4-tips-for-summer-skin-care"}

{"text": "As an academic working at a university, is it wrong to (personally) accept money for your research outputs? Would this be a bargain you would be happy to take?\n\nEXAMPLE: Suppose you are a Mathematician with valuable algorithms or expertise (e.g., quantum-era code breaking, fancy AI, ...) and you are offered a (secret) contract of $150,000+ in additional salary per year to give access to an external entity (e.g., company) all of your research before it is published. For example, your mathematical proofs and working computer codes. You give them the right to patent any results, to use the codes for their own purpose, and potentially veto the publication of any result they would like you to keep secret.\n\n1 Answer\n1\n\nAs an academic working at a university, you do not have unlimited freedom to enter into arrangements of the sorts you describe, but are limited to what your university's policies will allow you to do (which at my university would certainly not include the hypothetical secret agreement you described). And at established universities those policies have been carefully crafted to balance the university's rights and its mission of public service against the academic's desire and right to pursue side interests, including for pay, and also taking into account the fact that such side projects also often benefit society and thus advance the university's mission.\n\nSo the answer to your question is more boring than you might imagine: that is, if you are following the university's policies, then generally speaking it's not wrong (unless you are being particularly crafty, misleading in reporting your actions or intentions, or are otherwise pushing the limits of what's acceptable in a way many people would consider unreasonable); and conversely, if your actions clearly violate university policy, well, I don't want to generalize too much since one can always think of exceptions, but that's a pretty good sign that you shouldn't be doing what you're doing.\n\nHere are some relevant policies from the University of California system, in case you want to go deeper into this issue: 1, 2, 3.\n\nI'm in the Australian system, for example, University of Melbourne states that \"Copyright in all scholarly material is owned by the academic, unless there is a research, funding or other legal agreement to the contrary\". Also, similar to the UC system, we have an \"outside work\" policy allowing 52 days of external paid work a year.\n\n@partition_of_unity Well, Dan's statements hold. You have to find out whether you can have a contract with your employer (uni) that permits you to do what you stated above. It might be possible that part of your work can be kept confidential. But it's not clear what you mean by \"secret\". If it is a clandestine agreement with the company, then it might be simply illegal. In which case they may even renege on your payment for your work without you having a recourse. But confidential work exists, and can be perfectly legal. However, I doubt that you can filter all your work through the company.\n\n@partition_of_unity copyright and patent rights are very different things. At my university the scenario \"you give them the right to patent any results\" is completely untenable (but assigning copyright to code or other material may be fine, indeed we regularly transfer copyright on our papers to publishers). And outside work under some circumstances needs to be reported to the university, so keeping the agreement secret is also very likely a dealbreaker. Anyway, as I was saying, whatever the employer is okay with is, pretty much by definition, not \"wrong\".\n\nYes, by secret I mean confidential and I had in mind China's Thousand Talents Plan which is being strongly investigated in the US and Australia. I guess my question is: Is it bad because it is by China? or is it bad in general? Personally I believe there shouldn't be a difference if the entity was China or a company.\n\n@partition I'm not going to get into a discussion about whether some specific country is \"bad\". In general, one can well imagine an evil country or corporation paying a researcher money to influence that researcher's work or benefit from their knowledge somehow in a nefarious way. This has been known to happen many times. And yes, that would be bad, don't get me wrong. It's just that you seem to have a misguided idea about the extent to which academics have the ability to sell out in the way you are thinking of. Researchers can and do sometimes behave unethically, but there are limits.", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "5f1816dc-5612-40cb-ac68-983e2c655f59", "url": "https://academia.stackexchange.com/questions/154655/taking-money-for-your-research-outputs"}

[…]\n\nThe local coordinate system of the lamp is used, so that the direction of the light can be changed. For UI reasons, it's usually best to add an area light,\nrotate it and then change its type, since especially the point light does not immediately show its local coordinate system in the viewport.\n\nFor now you'll have to wait for the patch to be approved and added into master before you can try it out, unless you're capable of applying the patch and building blender locally (which I failed at miserably).\n\nPost navigation\n\n8 thoughts on \"Native IES Support on its Way\"\n\nInteresting. I'm so not as \"technically minded\" as you are, but this looks very promising. I've been reading about it on the link you provided… as I understand it these IES things are a file format secifically for realisitc light setups, which you can then download/create and use in your scene or in multiple scenes. Similar to the way we use HDRi images? Anyway, It also says it's and industry standard format. That in itself is a good reason why it would be nice to have access to this.\n\nI've never actually used them myself, but I think you're describing them right. They seem super helpful for archviz stuffs and I remember lots of people demanding support for them before the add-on showed up.\n\nYeah, your description is very close. In basic terms, they are \"special lamps\" you can import that distribute the light according to a defined pattern. For example, in cycles the point lamp distributes evenly, but the spot light sends light down in a cone. These lamps work in a similar way, but with a more complicated and detailed distribution pattern (the images above simply show the lights up against a wall, demonstrating their distribution. :)\n\nThat looks awesome! This is a small detail I've never really thought of, but one that can make a huge difference. Most car headlights I've seen have that wavering in light strength which would add a lot to a render", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "0c40e212-b4b5-4a0f-b209-606efaebd480", "url": "https://blog.gregzaal.com/2015/11/03/native-ies-support-on-its-way/"}

{"text": " Key Initiatives for taking forward Children's Rights during the Reporting Period 2018-2021\n\nThe Scottish Government has taken forward a wide range of measures throughout the reporting period to better support children and young people to experience their rights. Many of these initiatives were highlighted in the progress reports published in 2019 and 2020. Some of our key achievements in the reporting period 2018-2021 are as follows:\n\nMeetings of the Scottish Cabinet with children and young people, ensuring that children's voices are heard at the highest level of Government.\n\nThe annual meeting between Cabinet members and children and young people, which has taken place since 2017, enables children and young people to raise issues that matter to them and to inform the Scottish Government's agenda over the coming year. At the end of each meeting, children, young people and Cabinet members have collectively agreed actions for the year ahead and published reports on the progress made in taking these forward.\n\nThe Permanent Secretary and the Scottish Government Executive Team have also met annually with members of the Scottish Youth Parliament to discuss issues of significance to young people in Scotland. The most recent meeting in November 2021 offered an opportunity for the Executive Team to hear from members of the Scottish Youth Parliament on topics taken from their Manifesto. Topics of greatest significance to young people in Scotland were discussed including rights and participation, mental health, education and gender recognition.\n\nMeasures in the Children (Scotland) Act 2020 to ensure that the rights of the child are at the heart of any family law case and that their views are heard\n\nThe Children (Scotland) Act 2020 (the 2020 Act) removes the presumption that a child aged 12 or over is considered mature enough to give their views in family court cases, Children's Hearings and permanence and adoption cases. This was in response to concerns that the presumption was leading to the views of younger children not always being heard, which was not the intention when the presumption was introduced. The 2020 Act places a requirement for a child's views to be sought when a court or a Children's Hearing is making a decision that concerns the child unless the court is satisfied that the child is not capable of forming a view. The child's preferred method of giving their views is to be used, unless it is not reasonable to do so, or the child has not expressed a preferred method of giving their views.\n\nThe 2020 Act also places a duty on the Scottish Ministers to make such provision as they consider necessary and sufficient to ensure that all children concerned in proceedings in which the court is considering making an order under section 11(1) of the Children (Scotland) Act 1995 have access to appropriate child advocacy services.\n\nWork to implement the Children (Equal Protection from Assault) (Scotland) Act 2019, giving children the same legal protection from assault as adults.\n\nThe Scottish Government supported the Children (Equal Protection from Assault) Scotland Act 2019 during its passage through the Scottish Parliament. The Act, which came fully into force on 7 November 2020, removed the common law defence of \"reasonable chastisement\" from the law of Scotland, essentially making all forms of physical punishment of children by a parent or carer unlawful in Scotland from that date.\n\nOur commitment to #KeepThePromise and help transform how Scotland cares so that all children grow up loved, safe and respected.\n\nIn 2017, the Scottish Government established an independent root and branch review of the care system for children and young people in Scotland, to help identify how to change the future of the care system for the better and improve both the quality of life and outcomes of young people in care. The review concluded with The Promise in February 2020, setting out over 80 recommendations.\n\nThe First Minister is fully committed to #KeepThePromise and has since supported The Promise Scotland to become a non-statutory company, allowing them to provide support and oversight to enable full implementation of the Care Review's conclusions. The Promise Scotland published The Plan 21-24, the first of three plans setting out the priorities to realising the ambition of implementing the Promise. This was followed by Change Programme ONE. The Scottish Government will play a pivotal role in keeping the Promise and is committed to delivering the transformational change required.\n\nFourth Anniversary of the baby box – with over 190,000 baby boxes distributed to families across Scotland since the introduction of the scheme.\n\nAt its heart, Scotland's Baby Box strongly signals our determination that every child born and resident in Scotland, regardless of their circumstances, should get the best start in life by ensuring that every family with a newborn has access to essential items needed in the first six months of a child's life. It is a simple idea which helps to tackle deprivation, improve health and support parents during the first few months of their child's life. The Baby Box balances practical items, such as the clothing, the hooded bath towel and the changing mat, with items designed to have a positive impact on parent-child interaction through the inclusion of books, a baby wrap and a play mat to support attachment, early learning and play.\n\nAn independent evaluation of Scotland's Baby Box, published in August 2021, highlighted a positive impact of the programme on families, both financially and in terms of wider benefits, such as informing them about, or reinforcing, key child health and development messages.\n\nOur investment in school counselling services across education in Scotland, alongside enhanced funding for Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services.\n\nThe Scottish Government Programme for Government (PFG) 2018/19 included a commitment to invest in access to school counselling services across education in Scotland. The aims and principles set out that the counselling service should be available for children aged 10 and over, meaning that the service would also be available for primary and special schools which are linked to the secondary school. We are providing £16 million[15] to local authorities per year to support delivery of the commitment. Local authorities have confirmed that counselling services are in place across Scotland.\n\nIn 2021-22 around £40 million has been allocated to improve the mental health care that children and young people receive through Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS). This will address CAMHS waiting times; support implementation of our National CAMHS Service Specification, which sets out the levels of service that children, young people and families can expect from CAMHS across Scotland and improve community CAMHS, with an expansion from age 18 years old to age 25 years old for targeted groups, and those who wish it. The funding will also provide access to out of hours assessments, intensive and specialist CAMHS services, which will benefit children and young people with complex needs, and their families, including in a home setting. This is part of a longer term commitment to ensure that by 2026, 10% of frontline NHS budget is invested in mental health, with 1% directed specifically to children and young people.\n\nRecord investment in measures to tackle child poverty, including the 'game changing' Scottish Child Payment\n\nThe Scottish Government set in statute the ambition to eradicate child poverty through the Child Poverty (Scotland) Act 2017, underpinned by ambitious income-based targets to be met by 2030. Concrete action to tackle and reduce child poverty is set out within the Tackling Child Poverty Delivery Plan: Every Child Every Chance 2018-2022.\n\nThis includes the introduction of the new Scottish Child Payment, worth £40 every four weeks, for eligible children – described by anti-poverty campaigners as a 'game-changer'. The Payment commenced in February 2021 for eligible children under the age of six, and will be delivered to all eligible children up to the age of 16 by the end of 2022 when it is estimated that up to 406,000 children will be eligible. Scottish Ministers have committed to doubling the value of the payment to £80 every four weeks as soon as is practicable, further enhancing the support available for children in poverty. In 2020-21, investment targeted at supporting children in low income households, reached almost £1 billion.\n\nThe ongoing extension of free school meals\n\nFree school meals are a vital support to thousands of children and young people across the country – ensuring they have access to a free, healthy and nutritious meal every day they are in school and are ready to engage in learning. The Scottish Government continues to offer free school meals to all children in Primary 1 to 3. In addition to this, a new £28 million commitment is now delivering free school lunches during term time for all children in primary 4. This will be further expanded to include all children in primary 5, starting in January 2022, and all primary 6 and 7 pupils from August 2022. The policy of providing universal free school meals saves all families an average of £400 per child, per year and 220,945 children are currently benefitting from this policy.\n\nWe are also providing £21.75 million to fund targeted support during school holidays for all families who meet the eligibility criteria to receive free school meals. Free school meals continue to be provided to children and young people who meet the income based eligibility criteria set out in statute outside of those age ranges where universal provision is made.\n\nWorld leading action to ensure period dignity for everyone in Scotland who menstruates.\n\nThe Scottish Government believes that being able to access period products is fundamental to equality and dignity. The Scottish Government has taken world leading and award winning action through investing over £21 million since 2017 to fund access to free period products across a range of settings including schools, colleges and universities, wider public spaces and targeted access through community groups for those on low incomes.\n\nIn October 2020, the Period Products in Schools (Scotland) Regulations 2020 came into force which places a duty on local authorities and grant-aided schools to provide free period products for pupils. These Regulations will be superseded by the Period Products (Free Provision) Scotland Act 2021 (\"the Act\") when it comes into force.\n\nThe Act, which received Royal Assent in January 2021, will place duties on local authorities and education providers to make period products obtainable free of charge for anyone who needs to use them. The Act will come fully into force by January 2023 at the latest. When in force, the Act will ensure that everyone in Scotland who menstruates can have reasonably convenient access to period products, free of charge, as and when they are required. In advance of this, free products continue to be available through voluntary provision and under the Regulations above. The Scottish Government remains ambitious about Scotland continuing to lead the way internationally not just to tackle period poverty, but to also achieve wider gender equality.\n\nExpanded funding to help close the poverty-related attainment gap and support education recovery.\n\nThe report highlighted that headteachers were positive about the impact of the Scottish Attainment Challenge, with nine out of ten schools reporting an improvement in closing the gap in attainment and/or health and wellbeing as a result of Attainment Scotland Fund-supported approaches. Building on existing progress, we are continuing to work in partnership with local authorities, schools and other partners to develop the Scottish Attainment Challenge programme.\n\nWe have extended our commitment to tackling the poverty related attainment gap and to supporting education recovery by committing an investment of £1 billion over the course of this parliament. As part of this, we have committed over £215 million to the Scottish Attainment Challenge in 2021/22. This record funding, the largest amount awarded as part of the Scottish Attainment Challenge for a single year, enables headteachers, schools, councils and other partners to provide targeted support for our most disadvantaged pupils\n\nThe expansion of the entitlement of funded early learning and childcare hours to all eligible children, up from 600 to 1140 hours per year.\n\nThe Scottish Government has made a significant investment in early learning and childcare (ELC) in order to expand the entitlement of funded hours to all 'eligible children' from up to 600 hours a year to up to 1140 hours a year from August 2021. A landmark multi-year funding agreement was reached by the Scottish Government and COSLA in April 2018 to fully fund the expansion.\n\nFunded ELC is available to all 3 and 4 year olds, irrespective of their parents' employment status, and to around a quarter of 2 year olds - those that evidence suggests will benefit most from early access to high quality ELC. Eligibility criteria target this early offer to children with experience of care or with a parent with experience of care; and those in families in receipt of no or low income benefits. The long-term outcomes of this investment are that: children's development improves and the attainment gap narrows; family wellbeing improves through enhanced nurture and support; and parents' opportunities to take up work, training or study increase.\n\nPublication of a new Air Quality Strategy which aims to reduce health inequalities across vulnerable groups, including children\n\nOver the last 50 years, air quality in Scotland has seen a significant overall improvement. The choking smogs of the 1950s are a thing of the past, driven by concerted action, especially on energy use, industry and transport. Air quality in Scotland's towns and cities is improving year on year, but there are still areas across the country where air quality standards for human and environmental health are not being met. Road transport in urban areas remains the significant contributor to poor air quality. Air pollution especially impacts on the more vulnerable members of society – the very young and the elderly or those with existing health conditions such as asthma, respiratory and heart disease. This makes air quality an important health inequalities issue.\n\nThe passage of the Age of Criminal Responsibility (Scotland) Act 2019, will increase the age of criminal responsibility in Scotland from 8 to 12 years.\n\nThe increase in the age of criminal responsibility (ACR) from 8 to 12 years old by way of full implementation of the Age of Criminal Responsibility (Scotland) Act 2019 will mean that Scotland has the highest minimum age of criminal responsibility within the four UK nations, reflecting this Government's progressive commitment to international human rights standards.\n\nThe Act requires the Scottish Ministers to carry out a review within 3 years of the commencement of section 1 of the Act (which will increase the ACR to 12 years old). The review will evaluate the operation of the Act in general as well as giving consideration to a future ACR. Evaluation of the Act will ensure that operational learning and experience about how the legislation and associated change programme operates for the under-12 age group can be taken into account as part of the overall consideration of a future higher ACR in Scotland.\n\nThe launch of a national advocacy service to reinforce the rights of children involved in the Children's Hearings System\n\nA national advocacy service to reinforce the rights of children involved in the Children's Hearings System was launched in November 2020. The demand-led service, means children and young people will be offered support to express their needs and views on decisions that affect their lives. From July 2021, the provision was expanded to also support the right of siblings to participate in Children's Hearings, where they are invited to give their views on when or how they want to see their brothers or sisters. The national scheme was backed by an initial £1.5 million, and increased to £1.8 million in 2021-22. A Children's Hearings Advocacy Expert Reference group was set up to support the design, delivery and implementation of the service, which is offered Scotland-wide by ten third sector providers. The funding supports the training and provision of advocacy workers.\n\nEnhanced use of pre-recorded evidence helps avoid the need for child witnesses in serious cases to face the trauma of giving evidence in court\n\nThe Vulnerable Witnesses (Criminal Evidence) (Scotland) Act 2019 was passed unanimously by the Scottish Parliament in May 2019. Following certain provisions in the Act coming into force in January 2020, child witnesses in some of the most serious criminal cases can have their evidence pre-recorded, avoiding the trauma of them having to give evidence in court during the trial. The exception to this is if it is shown that this would significantly prejudice the interests of justice in the individual case.\n\nThe enhanced use of pre-recorded evidence for child witnesses has been backed by Scottish Government funding, as has the establishment of a new evidence and hearings suite in Glasgow, specifically designed for the needs of children and other vulnerable witnesses, enabling evidence to be taken in a safe and secure environment. The evidence suite in Glasgow and the one planned within the Inverness Justice Centre, showcase what can be achieved for vulnerable witnesses through using high quality video recording equipment. Further work is also being undertaken in Edinburgh and Aberdeen.\n\nThe work of the National Taskforce for Human Rights Leadership, and a commitment to introduce a new Human Rights Bill\n\nIn March 2021, the National Taskforce for Human Rights Leadership published 30 progressive, bold and ambitious recommendations for a new human rights framework for Scotland.\n\nThe Scottish Government has accepted all of these recommendations, and as part of taking these forward, a new multi-treaty Human Rights Bill will be introduced this parliamentary session. The Bill will give effect in Scots law to a wide range of internationally recognised human rights - belonging to everyone in Scotland - as far as possible within devolved competence. This builds on the ongoing work to incorporate the UNCRC into Scots law, which, as part of our wider agenda of giving effect to human rights in Scotland, contributes to building momentum to see internationally recognised human rights being made directly justiciable in Scots law. The Programme for Government 2021-22 announced a commitment to consult on the Bill in the coming year. This Bill will demonstrate global human rights leadership, placing Scotland at the forefront of human rights legislation and, most importantly, practice.\n\nFurther information on other initiatives taken forward in support of children's rights within the reporting period is provided in the Annex to this Report.", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "2a269e3f-67ae-4bc2-a2d9-3d3853c6c2b3", "url": "https://www.gov.scot/publications/progressing-human-rights-children-scotland-report-2018-21/pages/5/"}

{"text": "Our children's library contains many different books, recounting the adventures of various characters like: The Gruffalo, Superworm, The Monkey Who Lost His Mum, The Whale and the Snail, Thomas the Tank Engine, and many others. We also have a collection of beautifully illustrated books about the Bible, retelling stories about Jesus.\n\nNow, you probably have never lost any sleep over the question: Does the Gruffalo actually exist? Of course, not – we recognise that it belongs the realm of fiction. However, have you ever wondered if Jesus actually existed in fact? That's a question that has consumed a significant portion of my life and the lives of countless others for almost two millennia.\n\nThe good news is that it's a question we can answer beyond reasonable doubt. Even the agnostic professor of the New Testament Bart Erhman begins one of his popular books: \"The reality is that whatever else you may think about Jesus, he certainly did exist\".\n\nWe have as much reason to believe that, as we do to believe that Caesar Tiberius existed. There are 10 sources for his existence recorded within 150 years of his life (one of which is a Christian source); while there are 42 sources for Jesus' existence in the same period (9 of which are non-Christian sources).\n\nIn his book \"Is Jesus History?\" the historian John Dickson takes the reader on a guided tour of those ancient sources that corroborate much of the Bible's testimony about Jesus. For example: two mentions in the Jewish historian Josephus (Antiquities 18:3, 20:9); one mention from the Roman historian Tacitus (Annals 15:44); as well as mentions from critics who record not only the existence of Jesus but also that Christians worshipped Jesus as God from the earliest of times:\n\n\"The Christians, you know, worship a man to this day — the distinguished personage who introduced their novel rites, and was crucified on that account\" (Lucian)\n\n\"Now if the Christians worshipped only one God they might have reason on their side. But as a matter of fact they worship a man who appeared only recently. They do not consider what they are doing a breach of monotheism; rather they think it perfectly consistent to worship the great God and to worship his servant as God… When they call him Son of God, they are not really paying homage to God, rather, they are attempting to exalt Jesus to the heights\" (Celsus)\n\nSo, without any further commitment, it is reasonable to conclude with a high degree of probability that Jesus really did exist. The more interesting question is why some 2000 years later should we care that he existed, any more than we care about the Caesars?\n\nThe philosopher Peter Kreeft paints a picture that helps us see how remarkable it is that we remember Jesus at all:\n\n\"He never entered politics, never fought a battle, and never wrote a book. He lived in a backwater nation, never went more than one hundred miles of his home, and was executed by crucifixion as a dangerous criminal. His moral teachings were not completely new. Nearly every piece of advice he gave us about how to live can be found in his own Jewish tradition, as well as in the philosophies of others. What caused his unparalleled impact?\" (Peter Kreeft).\n\nTo answer this question, we need to consult the primary historical sources of those who witnessed the life of Jesus, who watched Him perform divine acts, who heard Him claim to be a divine person. For example, you could take an hour or two to read the shortest and earliest of the gospels – The Gospel According to Mark.\n\nMark's pre-eminent question is: WHO IS JESUS? He starts off by telling us the answer, which he will seek to persuade us of throughout the rest of his book: \"The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God\" (1:1). At the centre of the book, there is a conversation between Peter and Jesus where Jesus asks \"And who do you say I am?\" and Peter replies with his marvellous confession: \"You are the Christ\" (8:29). Also, near the end, Mark records a Roman centurion who witnessed the death of Jesus: \"Truly this man was the Son of God!\" (15:39). Mark's gospel is all about identifying Jesus.\n\nIn this first half of the gospel, Mark takes us breathlessly through a series of action packed stories of Jesus. If you simply skim through these early pages of the gospel you'll see Jesus:\n\n1:21-28: Jesus liberates people suffering from demonic oppression\n\n1:29-34: Jesus heals people suffering from diseases\n\n2:1-12: Jesus forgives people of their sins and offences against God\n\n4:35-41: Jesus calms a storm at sea\n\n5:21-42: Jesus heals a woman from an incurable illness and raises a little girl from the dead\n\nMark wants us to see the good news that Jesus can overcome over the greatest threats to human flourishing: natural disasters, demons, diseases, and death. Mark also wants to show us that Jesus not only claims to be God, but does things that only God could do!\n\nAt the climax of the gospel, Jesus is arrested and sentenced to death for the crime of blasphemy – of claiming to be the Son of God. Jesus should have been just another forgotten victim of Roman brutality – another failed Messiah. However, in the final chapter of Mark's gospel we read the account of the first eyewitnesses to the resurrection of Jesus from the dead – vindicating His claims to be the Son of God and the Lord of life.\n\nStrangely, however, Mark ends on a minor key: \"Trembling and bewildered, the women went out and fled from the tomb. They said nothing to anyone, because they were afraid\" (16:8). Obviously, that's not the end of the story – more happened afterwards. But the question is why does Mark end this way? It seems Mark is wanting to draw you, the reader, into the story. He's challenging you – now that you know who Jesus is – it's your job to respond to the story and then you need to go and tell.", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "5e96d052-6d4f-46c3-be9f-3638a0179a5f", "url": "https://www.solas-cpc.org/have-you-ever-wondered-if-jesus-actually-existed/"}
{"text": "Hypertension\n\nLast updated: March 29, 2019\n\nWhat Does Hypertension Mean?\n\nHypertension is an ongoing medical condition that occurs when the blood pressure present in the arteries is persistently elevated. In the workplace, hypertension is a condition that is important to be aware of in order to determine the current health status of the individuals working. Hypertension can lead to heart disorders, strokes, kidney malfunction, and blindness. Hypertension is also commonly known as high blood pressure or arterial hypertension.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWorkplaceTesting Explains Hypertension\n\nHypertension is a continued state of high blood pressure. Blood pressure is the force that blood makes against the artery walls.

{"text": "A dog's paws are usually sturdy, yet they're prone to a few common injuries. While the cut or illness may seem minor to you, the pain or discomfort can be unbearable to your pups. One of the common dog paw problems is dry and cracked paw pads. It can be caused by extreme cold or hot weather, hot pavement, accidental injuries, and excessive licking. There are a lot of dog paw protection products on the market, you might be wondering whether it is necessary to pick up one for your pooches and how to get the right one for him/her. In that case, keep reading and we may have some insights to share.\n\nWhy is it important to protect your dog's paws?\n\nA dog's paws provide essential traction to its owner during walking, running, and fetching. According to Dr. Hyunmin Kim, DVM from ASPCA, the pads on the bottom of a dog \"protects bones and joints from shock, and protects tissue deep within the paw.\" In other words, it prevents a dog's feet from the harms of unfriendly walking ground and harsh weather conditions. Dogs' paw pads are usually tough, but that doesn't mean they're not susceptible to any injuries. Especially in the wintertime, the dry winter weather plus icy or snowy walking environment accelerate the dryness of your pooches' paw pads, leaving them vulnerable to cracking, splitting, and flaking.\n\nInjured or uncomfortable paws can significantly reduce dogs' active levels, impacting their overall physical and mental well-being. Symptoms of paw problems include limping, inflamed paws, excessive licking and chewing the affected paws, bleeding, and skin flakes from the paws. Prevention is always more important than treatment. One easy, affordable, and effective prevention method is to apply some protective paw balm on your pooches before you take them out on a walk on a freezing winter day, or bring them into an environment while bacteria and fungi are known, residents.\n\nDoes my dog need paw protection?\n\nThere is no generic answer to this question. The truth is that it all depends on you and your pup's living environment. For dogs living in places with extremely cold and hot weather, dogs who often walk on rough grounds, or exposed to hazardous chemicals while walking, it may be a good idea to use paw protective products before things get bad.\n\nNotice most dog paw protective products on the market are for prevention only. If your puppy is already hurt, such as redness, blistering, or skin problems on its paw pads, the best way to handle it is to go see a veterinarian since the \"cosmetic\" products sold on the market may not be able to \"heal\" the wounds and could cause secondary infections.\n\nWhat does dog paw balm do?\n\nA paw protection balm is an easy-to-use topical product that applies to the surface of your pooches' paw pads. It offers extra moisturization and recursion for the paw pads to stay away from the winter hazards that cause the cracking of the skin.\n\nChosen by Dogs CBD Paw Protection Balm takes this conventional approach to another level by adding natural CBD oil into the formula. Our paw-protecting balm is infused with ultra-nourishing CBD and essential oils to keep your pup's feet nourished and protected. This waxy balm works wonders in terms of preventing cracking while keeping your pups safe, happy, and healthy. Despite the effective CBD content in the formula, this product is completely THC-free and non-psychoactive.\n\nHow to apply dog paw balm?\n\nChosen By Dogs CBD Paw Protection Balm is designed to make use easy for both puppies and puppy owners. With a small amount of the balm, you just need to tickle your puppy's paws to apply. Use as needed, but we do not recommend using this product on your kitties.\n\nAbout\n\nQuick LinksCookies & Privacy\n\nWe use cookies to ensure that we give you the best experience on our website.

{"text": "So, looking through the books, I notice that the books assume everyone is a graduate of Starfleet academy, but Star Trek has always had a wide variety of characters, and not all of them had Starfleet-level training. Quark was terrible at engineering and could barely beam someone, Kira didn't seem to have any scientific training, and adulation couldn't operate a dermal regenerator. Not to mention T'Pol who was not (initially) part of Starfleet, among other characters. Is there a way to play these characters?\n\nThe Starfleet-focused core rulebook and by extension most of the STA line, focuses on playing Starfleet characters.That being said, the Gamma and Delta Quadrant sourcebooks provide advice on playing non-Starfleet characters integrated as part of a Starfleet crew, and the Klingon Empire core book discusses playing, well, Klingons of every stripe.\n\nAlso, for examples, Kira, Quark, Neelix, and Kes are all statted up as player characters in their respective series characters packs in PDF format. It's pretty easy to re-skin the lifepath to be not Starfleet focused and still give the characters high competency in whatever attribute or discipline you desire.\n\nThanks for the info. Like I said in another post, I'm still new to this system. Still a little iffy on it. Restricting all rolls to be part of command/conn/security/engineering/science/medical seems a bit weird to me. Like, what if you wanted to roll to see how good your freestyle jazz session was on talent night in ten-forward? I dunno, I suspect I'll get a better feel for it if I ever get to play. Thanks again for pointing me in the right direction.\n\nI'll be interesting to hear if the long-timers here have comments on how to shoehorn \"mundane\" tests like your jazz example into the system. I could see a number of ideas for that:\n\nPresence + Command, with the reasoning of commanding attention, that leadership involves presentation skills, etc. This one's a stretch, but it feels like the closest of the six disciplines on the sheet.\n\nPresence + (how good you think your character at their instrument, pick 0-5 based on the definition of each rating as defined in the book, and get GM buy-in)\n\nRoll 1d20 (or 2d6 for a nice bell curve) for a relative number of how well it went. If you go the d6 route, you could use the challenge dice mechanics and ask players to describe their effects.\n\nOne general rule I see a number of systems starting to adopt: Don't ask for a roll unless failure is either interesting or has meaningful consequences. A performance for some high-ranking diplomats who will be insulted if it isn't perfect, that's one thing. The jazz session example, I'd probably just ask the player(s) to tell me how well the think they did.\n\nI think it's fairly obvious that there is a market for a sourcebook for non-Federation characters and their cultures. Not everyone has as rich a background to draw on like the Bajorans, Romulans, and Ferengi, nor does everyone warrant a full core book like the Federation, Klingons, and Ferengi.\n\nBut people are hungry for opportunities to play Ferengi and other aliens as much as Starfleet and I sincerely hope that as the years unfold, the Ferengi will get the attention fans want.\n\nSure, I guess My jazz example wouldn't be a critical roll, but we have had music/performances/hobbies be crucial plot points in episodes before. There's a voyager episode where the doc sings so well that a species wants him to leave the ship and sing for them. The Enterprise episode \"A night in Sickbay\" (while universally derided) ends with Archer doing performance art so well that the Enterprise gets some crucial spare components. Spock's ability to beat the computer in chess is a plot point in a TOS episode. . .\n\nYet many other RPGs have six stats (Str, Dex con etc) - sometimes, as mentioned above, its not necessarily making something bespoke, its about using the flavour of the rules.\n\nFor example, a character playing music. I could argue its Science, as music is closely related to Maths, especially if I was looking for accuracy rather than \"soul\"; and if I was using it as a language (like Phantome in the Voyager episode) then even Engineering might be appropriate. If I was being attacked by crystalline beings, I might try to get a certain note just right to resonate and injure them, which might be a Task, combining Science, Medicine and Security\n\nThe Enterprise example with Archer's performance is a good one. There are stakes in play for success and failure, which implies it's time for a Task, and you're back in the boat of the six trained disciplines not mapping all that well to the challenge at hand.\n\nOn the other hand, in that example, were I the GM, I would probably be inclined to simply let Archer's player succeed at the task, because it was a character development moment to swallow their pride and go through with the performance. That makes for a good enough story on its own, I don't need math rocks to impose their will on things after the fact.\n\nFerengi are given details in the Alpha Quadrant sourcebook, along with a bunch of other species and their cultures, worlds, etc.\n\nA character's jazz session is as good as the player wants it to be, unless there's a dramatic question hinging on their performance in the story that would warrant the need for a task roll. Are they being judged and if their performance sucks, some omnipotent being will snap their crewmates into oblivion? Sure, then attempt a task with the attribute and discipline most appropriate to the situation, give it a difficulty, and have the character roll them bones. If there's no dramatic reason to roll the dice, then as GM say 'yes, and' and describe the scene with the player and get on with the game.\n\nControl + Command or Control + Engineering would likely work well for a performance with an instrument.\n\nHaving a focus in a given skill area (e.g. jazz music) is how the system makes up for the broadness of the department ratings. A character with a high department rating is merely good at that skill set; with a focus, they can become a virtuoso. Especially if backed up by a value-driven determination point or an appropriate talent.\n\nMomentum and assistance rolls (in the form of preparations) may also be relevant at achieving a high degree of success.\n\n(And before someone points out that with six foci, you can't possibly cover all the options, remember that a good GM will be setting challenges for their PC's skill sets - so no throwing chess challenges at a crew with no chess players!)\n\nIf the music challenge, for example, is important enough that you want to make it the centrepiece of a story, then it presumably has some point in the ongoing plot. If this is diplomatic, it may be worth looking at the Social Conflict rules: the performance is just one part of the whole process.\n\nThis system is quite deliberately trying to move away from the huge lists of specific skills that blighted older attempts at this setting in favour of broader options that simplify the gameplay and encourage more roleplaying. It can take a little getting used to, but it works surprisingly well with a little lateral thinking.\n\nRegards civilian/non-Starfleet characters, it's certainly possible to extrapolate how to handle them, but it does take some thinking. However, while there's an argument that Starfleet officers are hyper-competent, this game does reflect the show reality, which is that series regulars are roughly equivalent, regardless of the source of their training. We've got an exchange conn officer in our game, but we just used the basic rules to generate him: the player simply reenvisioned some of the details to fit his character conception.\n\nCouple of thoughts. On the artistic task idea, i.e. a jazz recital, if it is something vital to the scene, or even the vital lynchpin of the adventure, and for what ever reason none of the stats apply; maybe use a Value and Momentum spend. Proportionate to the difficulty and desired degree of success, of course.\nAs to non-Fleet heroes, the Twenty Third, TOS campaign I am playing in has a possible \"final legacy of his world\" character the crew found on their openning adventure. He is the only one of his kind, once their representative and living embodiment, with unique traits and abilities. There is ample framework in the Core Rules to make such a being. Adaptibility is one of the things encouraged in this game system, and really all good RPGs.\n\nI had forgotten about it until you all mentioned Jazz music and dramatic question hinging on the performance.\n\nI read a book based off Heinlein's notes \"Variable Star\" . The protagonist is a saxophone expert, and one of his friends is in a deep depression (someone died or something, I can't remember exactly) and it is critical for the ship that he gets out of his funk. The hero practices for weeks and makes an amazing song in honor of his friend. It helps him finish the morning process and snaps him out of the funk.\n\nSo yes, I could see a scenario like this (for any game not just Star Trek).\n\nAs for the attempt(s). the attribute would be presence of course, but the science would be critical (it was a perfectly composed piece) , then medicine (he made it perfectly to pull up the suppressed emptions and helping him work through mourning process) and then command (because it was made so engaging and impressive and heart felt).\n\nI'm not experienced enough with this system to say exactly how I'd handle it btb, but it would fit 'Traveller' and the task chain would be perfect.\n\nNow, I will also agree that I'd love a book or something on non Star Fleet based characters. Something for a merchant (free trader, or a boomer) a colonist, or other things. Of course you can reskin the btb to make one, but more books are more good (well to a point, the 2e splat books and 3e crunch books did go tooooo far)\n\nThe hero practices for weeks and makes an amazing son in honor of his friend. It helps him finish the morning process and snaps him out of the funk.\n\nSomehow the idea that fathering a child took weeks of practice and was how he topped off his mornings makes me wonder if this is perhaps why Starfleet decided to add family quarters to their big 24th c starships. Doing it to honor a friend though…a little weird.", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "0a8f4119-d95d-4f34-93b2-b5148f3dfe44", "url": "https://forums.modiphius.com/t/creating-non-starfleet-characters/12986"}

{"text": "The different types of firewalls available that you should know about to choose the best one for yourself\n\nHere in this article, we will explain 6 different types of firewall used to protect the computer and its network system for intrusion and hackers.\n\nWhat is a firewall?\n\nWhile talking about internet and security, we all have come across the term firewall, which is a kind of network element (either software or hardware or both) that protects our computers or network from malicious activities. A firewall is not a brick-and-mortar wall with a fire burning around it, but it is actually something that Keeps your computer, and the programs running within it safe. It also prevents the computer or certain programs on a computer from accessing the internet, or stop specific packets, which can also be used for malicious activities. Talking about Windows, it has its own Firewall, however, you can even depend on a third-party firewall and you can get one using third-party antivirus software, for a personal computer.\n\nTalking about firewalls, there are different kinds of firewalls available and each of them works at its level to keep your computer safe in the long run. So, if you are looking for maximum security for your computer and your complete system of computers, or a network, you should know about how different kinds of firewalls work at its own level to deliver an optimum level of security. Depending upon your work, you can even implement those firewalls in your own system or organization, to keep them safe.\n\nSo without any further delay, let's get started with the different kinds of firewalls that you will often come across while dealing with computers and security.\n\nPacket filtering firewall\n\nAmong the different types of firewalls available, the packet filtering firewall does its job basically at the junctions, like the router, switch, hub and other network components. It then compares the packets with some known patterns to make sure, the packers and not meant to harm the computer or the devices connected to the network. Packet filtering Firewall actually does not route any packets, however, it will automatically drop the packets without reporting its presence if it is found malicious in some way or the other. Packets are dropped or reported malicious by looking at the IP address, port number and associated information In the packet header.\n\nAs packet filtering firewall does not inspect the content of the packet altogether it can serve the basic level of security by inspecting the packet header, which can be useful in many circumstances. Packet filtering firewall is great for small network however, if you are having a big network, packet filtering firewall can go more complex and will not deliver optimum performance. Besides that, as a packet filtering firewall does not keep any logs, it is a big drawback, and networks configured with packet filtering firewalls are vulnerable to spoofing attacks.\n\nCircuit-level Gateway firewall\n\nThe circuit-level Gateway firewalls work in a different way and it inspects the TCP handshakes and other ways of network initialization to make sure that the remote devices or the servers are trusted. Packet level Gateway Firewall will also inspect whether the local system has permissions to connect to the remote server show that malicious activities do not take place. In the case of circuit-level Gateway firewalls, the firewall does not inspect the packets altogether, or the contents, which means it also doesn't guarantee maximum security.\n\nHowever, if you are looking for the best network performance, choosing a circuit-level gateway firewall can be the best choice for you. Circuit level Gateway firewall isn't capable of filtering packets as per the content, which is a major drawback for this particular firewall. But the fact that it is more efficient in processing traffic compared to that of application-level firewalls, is also something that most users and network admins find in handy.\n\nStateful inspection firewall\n\nThe third major type of Firewall is a stateful inspection firewall, and it inspects the packets in a deeper way, which eventually ensures, the packages that are getting transmitted, is a part of one or more establish the connection to the remote server(s). So, besides considering the packet headers, the firewall also ensures that the packet isn't coming from any unauthorized source that might harm a system in some way or the other. A stateful inspection firewall does its job in the network layer of the OSI model and it is considered more reliable compared to the other kinds of firewalls that are available.\n\nHowever, just like the moon has scars, a stateful inspection Firewall will affect the performance of your network as it requires more processing power compared to the activity of other types of firewalls available. A stateful inspection Firewall is also a difficult task to setup. Stateful inspection firewalls can be a shield against denial-of-service attacks, and can also operate with fewer ports, besides keeping the system safe from attacks that have the ability to exploit protocol vulnerabilities.\n\nApplication-level gateway firewall\n\nThis type of Firewall also known as a proxy firewall inherits some properties of packet filtering and circuit-switched firewalls. In case of the application-level gateway firewall, the packets are filtered with certain characteristics of the packets and the network connection established, like the HTTP request string. An application-level gateway offers more security to a computer system, as all the applications connected to the network should be first connected to the proxy, which eventually hides the actual IP address so that the attackers do not consider the system vulnerable by not being able to recognize the system.\n\nAn application-level gateway firewall can be useful to prevent computer systems from attacks, which cannot be tracked down in the network and transport layer of the OSI model. However, an application-level gateway firewall isn't a child's play to set up. Besides that, it also requires a lot of processing power to operate application-level gateway firewalls, which means, it isn't a feasible solution for all computer networks out there. As, in application-level gateway firewalls, all the applications should be first connected to the proxy, it can sometimes increase latency.\n\nNext-generation firewall\n\nIf you are looking for additional security, a next-generation firewall offers the functionalities of traditional firewalls, along with additional functionalities like intrusion detection and prevention, efficient malware scanning and a lot more. The next-generation firewalls are also capable of monitoring network protocols from the second layer, i.e. the data link layer of the OSI model through the top or application layer of the OSI model.\n\nEven though the next-generation firewalls are more efficient, setting up this type of firewall requires huge investments, and most enterprises might not need all the features of a next-generation firewall. Next-generation firewalls also implement deep packet inspection, which means, the firewall also looks at the actual data, each packet is carrying, which eventually ensures the best possible security. This can though take a toll on the network performance, but the high level of security is the best gift that you get in return.\n\nChoosing the right firewall\n\nNow, if you are at the brink of choosing a firewall for your requirements, the answer to this question actually requires to question yourself about what exactly you need. The requirements vary from company to company, and, it also depends upon what exactly the firewall will be configured to safeguard. Besides that, you should have a precise idea of your organization's architecture to help you understand what level of security you want, and how exactly it will work within your organization.\n\nThere are even some customized firewalls, which can implement features from different firewalls to address certain requirements of certain architectures used in different organizations. Choosing or implementing the right firewall is very important, because a firewall not configured properly may be as bad or even worse than having a firewall at all.\n\nSo that was all that you should know about the different types of firewalls available.

{"text": "Closed Circuit: Managing Our Social Media Habits\n\nclosed circuit (noun, Electricity). \"a circuit without interruption, providing a continuous path through which a current can flow.\" (dictionary.com)\n\nWhen it comes to modern technology, a closed circuit is an incredibly useful thing. Closed circuits allow electricity to flow through the appliances we use every day, giving us light, heat/air conditioning, the wonders of washing machines, etc. But we don't always want power pulsing through these appliances, burning out our lightbulbs, and raising our bills. So, we have off switches and power buttons. We have ways to open the circuits and give the electricity a rest–to manage the precious resource of energy.\n\nIn a similar way, social media allows ideas to flow from one person to another. It can become a closed circuit, connecting us as writers to our audiences without interruption. Social media provides a highway through which we can send encouragement and receive it in return; a pathway for us to share news and hear what others have to say; an ever-moving current of communication that can be incredibly useful. But if we neglect to turn it off, it can also burn us out and sap our resources. If we aren't careful, our closed circuits can do us more harm than good.\n\nManaging Our Social Media Habits:\n\nAs writers, we face a lot of pressure to build our social media presence consistently. We want to grow meaningful followings and make ourselves available to others. We also want to get our message out in an effective way. In order to achieve these goals, we might be tempted to spend hours and hours online. Slowly, we can fall into believing that a consistent online presence requires constant online activity.\n\nThe problem is that too much of anything is harmful, and this is especially true of social media. Allowing an uninterrupted flow of media turns a useful tool into a destructive mechanism that wears down the soul. Social media can become addicting, it can harm relationships, and it can damage our perception of ourselves and others. A continuous intake of other people's opinions, controversy, and funny cat videos impacts the way we think even after we step away from the screen.\n\nIn order to use social media effectively, we have to find a balance between engaging and purposefully disconnecting. So how do we know where to draw the line and set our boundaries? How do we know when it's time to turn off the switch and cut the current?\n\nHere are three red flags I've found recently which warn me that I need to reevaluate my social media habits:\n\n1: When my presence in the digital world prevents my engagement with daily realities.\n\nAfter spending the summer trying to build my media platforms, I've noticed myself replacing day-to-day engagement with social media communication. I find myself instinctively reaching for my phone first thing in the morning or when I sit down to eat. Or wasting half an hour at a time scrolling through posts I don't even fully process.\n\nWhile I'm engaging in social media purely out of habit (or as a procrastination method), I lose hours of my day. I end up cutting out activities like reading or art, because I've simply run out of time. I miss moments with my family because I feel I have to comment on posts or reply to messages.\n\nWhen these things start to occur regularly, rather than just once in a while, I know it's time to cut back. One thing I'm trying to do is to limit myself to only checking social media in 5 minutes chunks, preferably at times when I can't really do much else (such as standing in a long line at the grocery store). That, or I limit myself to only checking it once or twice a day.\n\nThe biggest reminder I give myself is that social media is just a footnote to life, not the other way around. While building relationships online can help us show love to people we'll never meet in person, those relationships can't take the place of the ones right here, right now. While we can use social media to help make a difference, that impact can't replace the influence we have in person. Our day-to-day realities have to come first.\n\n2: When the current I'm taking in changes my output from positive to negative.\n\nWhen my social media habits become more time-consuming, I find myself getting stressed by everything I'm absorbing from media. Arguments, controversies, and the fears of others lay heavy on my shoulders and make me worried about things beyond my control. I find myself bothered by my inability to impact world events, and I feel like I'm not doing enough to help with all the various causes I see others advocating for daily.\n\nAnd when I put away the phone, the worries persist. I begin to see negativity everywhere and forget to see beauty for all my pondering of the trials facing our society.\n\nWhile it's good to be aware of the problems around us, we shouldn't let that become all we see. We can't carry the weight of the world alone. If we're trying to take in and take on every problem we see others facing on social media, we lose our ability to help in the ways we're capable of.\n\nInstead, we need to be actively engaged in our daily, present activities. Being tuned in to our daily lives first lets us bring a more authentic voice to our media platforms. Living in the present, rather than the digital world, gives us the perspective we need to be discerning in our intake of the messages bombarding us online. It helps us to find encouragement and kindness to share on days when our social media only sends us negativity.\n\n3: When the closed circuit of media becomes a short circuit, cutting out of my path the things that recharge me.\n\nI'm blessed to have many sources of wholesome messages on my media feeds. I follow people who consistently share content filled with hope, joy, and reminders of God's love and holiness. Even so, my Facebook and Instagram feeds are also filled with content that's negative, or even good but distracting. (Adorable dog videos anyone?)\n\nWhen my social media habits replace the activities that recharge me, not even the good content is enough to justify the time I'm spending online. Taking pictures of nature to share on Instagram shouldn't keep me from enjoying the beauty of God's creation myself. Reading a friend's perspective on a Bible verse is wonderful; however, it shouldn't replace my personal Bible study.\n\nEvery moment of quiet doesn't need to be filled with the noise of other's thoughts, and if we fill all our quiet time with social media, we rob ourselves of the chance for rest.\n\nOpening the Social Media Circuit:\n\nAt the end of the day, the most important part of managing our social media habits is being willing to turn it off and walk away. To disconnect totally and leave the issues we're dealing with on media on our media. Just as turning off lights in rooms we're not in helps conserve energy, purposefully disconnecting from social media helps us manage our resources of time and energy well. While we do need to connect with our audiences and be aware of events in the world, we don't need a continuous, uninterrupted flow of digital input.\n\nSo shut down the app. Turn off the notifications. Give yourself permission to make your audience wait a day for another reply.\n\nAnd finally, rather than letting our minds be ruled by social media, may we always be intentional about where we let our thoughts dwell.\n\n\"Finally, brothers, whatever is true, whatever is honorable, whatever is right, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is admirable—if anything is excellent or praiseworthy—think on these things.\" –Philippians 4:8 (You can connect with her on Instagram @karleyconklin )", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "9e49768c-9d5d-413e-b173-a97b815f3de3", "url": "https://write2ignite.com/2020/10/05/closed-circuit-managing-our-social-media-habits/?replytocom=852"}
{"text": "Suggested Topics\n\nThey are different terms\nCallout is an older term that dates to paper-based design before the web. Callouts are used in design to draw attention to or label something. Here are some callouts labeling the orientation of a part:\nThere are many ways to style callouts, but usually there is a line or an arrow to indicate the subject of the callout. Here are some callout styles from Microsoft PowerPoint:\nPopup is a user-interface term that describes content appearing on top of other content (e.g. a dialog box, warning message, or modal window).\nThere are some instances where popups are also callouts. For example, here is a popup callout used in a web tutorial:\nCallout menus (menus which slide down or pop out while highlighting the trigger button) are another example of callout styling mated with popup interaction.\nThese popup + callout examples may give rise to some of the confusion between the two terms, but the two terms continue to represent different concepts today.\n\nRight syntax is\nSELECT string_variable ~ regexp_mask\nIt returns true if and only if string_variable matches regexp_mask.\nIn first example\nSELECT 'abc_0' ~ 'abc_[0-9]'\nregexp_mask is 'abc_[0-9]'. Such example will check if string 'abc_0' contains text 'abc_' and then 1 digit symbol from interval [0-9].\nIn second example\nSELECT 'abc_[0-9]' ~ 'abc_0'\nregexp_mask is 'abc_0' It checks if string 'abc_[0-9]' contains text 'abc_0'. But it has a brace [ between abc_ and 0, that's why such check returns false.\nIn first example braces [] means interval, in second - text.\n\nNEW and OLDin trigger functions are records - each only defined where applicable. (So no OLD in an INSERT trigger, for instance.) You can perform ROW operations on them. Reference nested columns with dot notation (like table-qualified column names) like they were tables included in the FROM list. NEW and OLD are visible almost everywhere in SQL DML statements in a trigger function. (Except dynamic SQL with EXECUTE.)\nTo treat NEW as actual table you'd have to transform it first - which is typically not necessary. Like: (SELECT NEW.*). For a meaningful use case see chapter 3. in this related answer:\nPostgreSQL use NEW in query for INSTEAD OF trigger\nYour basic trigger function burns down to:\nCREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION unnest_and_normalize_json()\nRETURNS trigger AS\n$func$\nBEGIN\nINSERT INTO many_to_one_table (parent_table_id, subfield_a, subfield_b)\nSELECT NEW.id\n, ja->>'subfieldA' AS subfield_a -- column alias only for documentation\n, ja->>'subfieldB'\nFROM unnest(NEW.jsonb_array_field) ja; -- produces a derived table\nRETURN NEW; -- optional for AFTER trigger\nEND\n$func$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;\nThis was just noise:\nif NEW.jsonb_array_field is null then ...\nThe column jsonb_array_field is defined as:\njsonb_array_field jsonb[] NOT NULL DEFAULT '{}'::jsonb[],\nIt's an AFTER trigger, the NOT NULL constraint would already have raised an exception for NULL in jsonb_array_field at this point.\nYou can merge your two triggers into one:\nCREATE TRIGGER unnest_and_normalize_json_on_insert\nAFTER INSERT OR UPDATE ON parent_table -- !\nFOR EACH ROW EXECUTE PROCEDURE unnest_and_normalize_json();\nThat said, you'd have to do a lot more to cover UPDATE and DELETE properly. Similar to this one (chapter The dark side\nCan PostgreSQL have a uniqueness constraint on array elements?\n\nUnder heavy concurrent write access, the defense against deadlocks is to process rows in consistent order in all writing queries.\nYou may have sorted rows properly in all your writing queries to the table tweet- did you? (I know about that table from your related question.)\nAnd you are obviously sorting rows to be \"upserted\" in url_starting in the trigger function.\nThat should do it for transactions inserting a single row in tweet with multiple URLs to be upserted in url_starting.\nBut while inserting multiple rows to tweet, each with an arbitrary array of URLs, rows to be upserted in url_starting are still in inconsistent order for the transaction. URLs are only sorted per row in tweet, not for the whole transaction (or even command). You would need to unnest all URLs of the same INSERT, sort them consistently, and then upsert url_starting. This cannot be achieved with a trigger FOR EACH ROW. I don't think you can solve this at all with your current approach while inserting multiple rows with arbitrary arrays of URLs. Concurrent write access to both tables is inherently conflicting.\nSingle-row inserts to tweet should be fine (each in its own transaction) - though possibly substantially more expensive. Maybe you can get rid of the trigger completely and reorganize the workflow (with data-modifying CTEs): write a sorted list of URLs to url_starting, then write to tweet ...\nArrays are often problematic in a relational table design. Full normalization might be another approach - replacing the array column with a related table. Not sure if that's the way ...\nOr you keep your transactions as short and fast as possible, making deadlocks the rare exception, and prepare your application to retry in case of an error.\n\nI would caution against using triggers where you should be using other methods. Triggers are nice for temporary fixes when you can't fix the application or database structure right away, but if you use them as an permanent and integral part of the workflow, things become confusing.\nYou table structure doesn't seem right. Instead I'd suggest:\nproduct:\nproduct_id (primary key)\nother columns for the product\nuser:\nuser_id (primary key)\nother columns for the user\nproduct_rating:\nproduct_id (foreign key to product table)\nuser_id (foreign key to user table)\nrating\n(product_id, user_id) is a composite primary key\nThis table structure makes the trigger unnecessary, and it also allows more than one rating for each product. If you want to allow a certain user to rate a certain product more than once, then you need a special column to be the primary key as in the other tables, call it e.g. product_rating_id.\n\nI'm not sure why you're putting the EXT IN a HAVING clause, but this should work.\nWHERE IFNULL(mxuser.EXTENSION, mxuser_1.EXTENSION)\nIN (207, 213, 235, 214, 226, 218, 224, 227, 216)\nGROUP BY IFNULL(mxuser.EXTENSION, mxuser_1.EXTENSION)\nORDER BY ext=235 DESC, ext=207 DESC, ext=218 DESC, ext;\n\nThe reason for the error is that your code compares an array to an integer, i.e. the array in the column with any of the values in the array [1,3].\nFrom the comments, it seems that the wanted result is when the two arrays (column and given array) have at least one common item, i.e. they overlap. The operator for \"overlap\" is &&:\nSELECT\n*\nFROM\ncompany_employee_contacts\nWHERE\ncorporate_complaint_type_ids && ARRAY[1,3] ;\nFor more operators on arrays, see the documentation: Array Functions and Operators\nThe idea of using ANY is good but you need a \"double ANY\" and this syntax would work (if it was valid\nWHERE -- not valid syntax\nANY(corporate_complaint_type_ids) = ANY(ARRAY[1,3]) ;\nYou could unfold both arrays or one of the two (using unnest() function) and combine it with ANY. This would be equivalent to the overlaps operator and work - although I see no reason to use something so complicated:\n-- unfold with unnest and ANY\nWHERE\nEXISTS\n( SELECT 1\nFROM unnest(corporate_complaint_type_ids) AS u\nWHERE u = ANY(ARRAY[1,3])\n) ;\n-- or the reverse\nWHERE\nEXISTS\n( SELECT 1\nFROM unnest(ARRAY[1,3]) AS u\nWHERE u = ANY(corporate_complaint_type_ids)\n) ;\n-- or both with unnest\nWHERE\nEXISTS\n( SELECT 1\nFROM unnest(corporate_complaint_type_ids) AS u1,\nunnest(ARRAY[1,3]) AS u2\nWHERE u1 = u2\n) ;\n\nGot a PgSQL.  But if you need to look after this field, it won't fit. It's more interesting than that.  - then you can make a lot of good use of data, tidy requests, etc. - detailed examples are given in the dock. Therefore, you will consider the option of converting XML in JSON before retaining. If JSON is not suitable for any reason (e.g. XML cannot always be reconciled in JSON without loss) - then just keep the text in the field, create a type of GIN or GIST index, and it is possible to build a la-float search (including combination with normal conditions and joining).

{"text": "How to Write a Case Study Paper\n\nThis article will offer suggestions and techniques for writing case research. In this article, we will talk about the format of a case study, the methods used for collecting data and the drawbacks of the case study. This article will offer tips for formatting and design. Read on for further details. In addition, there are some examples of research papers. The article will also teach you how to stay clear of making mistakes as you write your papers.\n\nA case study's structure\n\nThere are various ways to format the case study essay. The introduction is the first step in setting the tone. The introduction should outline the issue the essay is trying achieve. To provide context to the reader, background information must be provided as well as examples. The introduction should end with an assertion of thesis. The paper's remainder should be able to answer your query. The arrangement of a case study should be consistent with directions given by your professor.\n\nIn general, case studies are written in a chronological format, however there are some exceptions to this rule. An executive summary must be included, along with an overview of the literature as well as recommendations. A case study either in a problem-focused and/or historical approach. The historical case study is an assessment of a closed-case and is a form of reflective learning. In any way that you take the subject, the basic components of your paper will remain unchanged.\n\nThe introduction should also include background information about the client. Information about the client should contain details about the client's age, gender , and physical health. It's important to take note of the clients' symptoms, thinking as well as coping abilities. A detailed description of the diagnostic assessment should also be included. An end-of-the-day conclusion needs to be drawn, and then discussed to support the previous research. It is vital to highlight any limitations to the study.\n\nFollowing the writing of a draft, the author should review the paper for any issues that remain unclear. The best rule of thumb is to stay away from jumping into conclusions during the initial draft, but look for solutions in the second. It buyessay is crucial to be condensed, clear as well as interesting. Therefore, creating a second draft is essential. This draft is designed to consolidate the information of the first draft. There are several steps throughout the process, however final results are the same.\n\nMethods for collecting data\n\nThe techniques used to collect data in a case study report differ based assignments help on the kind of research conducted. Some are structured like an ordinary scientific paper or thesis papers, while some have a narrative nature. Case studies were created to examine a case in detail, analyze the implications and determine what the implications are. Using textual and discourse analysis, case studies must also provide context-specific details as well as connect to literature and explore larger patterns.\n\nThe survey and the closed-response fixed-response or closed-response surveys are two examples for qualitative studies. Surveys do not work as well in analyzing social behavior, however they are useful for analyzing individual attitudes as well as behaviours. The qualitative methods of research in contrast utilize a range of methods to gather information. Once you've collected all the relevant data and you're ready to choose which method is best suited to your objectives.\n\nThe most common methods of gathering information for an article on case studies are surveys and interviews. The educator-researcher selects the relevant individuals from a small number. They analyze and organize the entire data. There are various methods of gathering data. These include surveys and group interviews, observation, field notes, narratives or diaries. The key is to gather as much data as you can but ensure that you are following the proper methods to meet your research objectives.\n\nAnother option to gather data for a case study paper is by conducting secondary research. Secondary research is conducted using open sources. The process of interviewing people is a qualitative method for research. Interviews may be informally or with a formal tone. Interviews can be informal or formal. The key is that in both instances the questions should be straightforward and should encourage participants to be themselves. The aim of interviews is to get a thorough understanding of the issue. It is important to realize the importance of secondary research, which uses quantitative data. Therefore, qualitative methods work better for qualitative research.\n\nWhat are the limitations of a study\n\nThe paper, as its name implies, is a case-study paper. The process isn't as straightforward as the title suggests. Its limitations can have a major impact on the research. While a limitation involving null value bias might be more secure, it must be recognized. The following paragraphs will discuss these limitations. The final part of the report.\n\nOne of the biggest drawbacks of research studies is their effectiveness in confirming or disproving the validity of a concept. Although they can't confirm the validity of theories, studies have a greater chance of being generalizable than other kinds of research. Seawright and Gerring note that using an appropriate sample might not yield the richest insight, and using random samples does not prevent the emergence of cases that are deviant. A case study based on anecdotes can offer greater detail and trigger basic methods that aren't readily available for cases that are representative.\n\nThe best case studies are those that have a focus on a particular instance. If not, the entire group will not be involved. Studies using case studies have been proven particularly effective when applied to the field. Researchers can evaluate processes and programs and then improve their practice. It is also a common way to assess the effectiveness of new educational programs and innovations, as well as guide policy. They are a particularly valuable method of study.\n\nIn the case of an investigation in which a literature review is required, it should offer background information on the topic and its background. The literature review should summarise the main findings and what the study has contributed to the field. Additionally, a research paper should end by explaining the impact it had on the field and potential for future research. The final section should also contain the thesis conclusion. Literature reviews must be relevant. The literature review must contain an in-depth discussion of every case study to address the original question.\n\nA format for case studies\n\nA case study paper follows the same structure as a research paper. The document must have four components: an introduction as well as the body. Then, there is the final section. The introduction must state the inquiry to be considered or the issue to investigate and provide background details about the subject and the chosen case. Your main conclusions, along with an overview of previous cases. The conclusion should contain reference to research that is ongoing and a discussion of the importance of the case study.\n\nThe abstract paragraph should measure around 150 to 200 words and should provide an overview of your case study paper. It should be clear and succinct, and communicate the findings in a way that is engaging. Notes, references, and credited sources should be included in the last  paragraph. Below are some examples of the format for papers on case studies. Additionally, you can find numerous cases studies on the internet.\n\nAdditionally to the introduction and case study outline, it must include future goals. The outline should present the reader with a clear picture of what the person did to solve the problem. Following the case summary, the executive summary should follow. It must not go over the length of two to four sentences. It should have the equivalent of two to three bullets which highlight the accomplishments for the clients. If it is possible, you should pull the information about the client from their site or LinkedIn Business profile.\n\nUse the APA form for the case studies. You should include credible sources such as research data as well as surveys. References to the study should be provided, as well as any statistics or data. Conclusions should not be speculation, but based on research findings. A paper of this type should adhere to the case study form as closely as it is possible. Your professor will be awestruck when you complete the paper.\n\nMaking use of a template when writing the case study\n\nA template will allow you to narrow your focus on the same subject. These templates are often adaptable enough to be customized according to the demands of your research. Although there are numerous types  and formats for case studiesto choose from, the format you use is less important as the quality of the research you conduct. Case studies are written using any of three formats that are commonly used, which include narrative, quantitative or qualitative.\n\nFirst, format the case study using a format that's easy to the people you want to reach. It can be shared on social mediaplatforms, as well as search engine optimized. It's also a good means to contact individuals who are searching for resources for case studies. Bold fonts are a good choice for highlighting information or goals for business when making formatting. You can also highlight challenges confronted and the successful approaches adopted by your company. Include logos of your customers in order to maximize the value of your case research.\n\nIn the section titled \"problems\" you will need to create your hook. The protagonist must be relatable and solve the business issue. Although they may not be the most enjoyable but they're still important. Don't overdo the words. Keep it neat and attractive. Be sure to ensure your conclusion is enlightening to your readers.\n\nIf you're seeking an easier method to format your case study, consider using templates. WordStream's Case Study Template Doc contains all of the steps that you must adhere to for a high-quality case study. You can also try Canva as well as Visme and both have no-cost logins. In addition to template templates for case studies, the majority of them will be customizable for free. for personal use.", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "bb73fa3d-0b19-479b-a33f-6e03059e7dfe", "url": "https://inspiringchunks.com/how-to-write-a-case-study-paper/"}
{"text": "THIS DAY IN HISTORY\n\nUkraine signs peace treaty with Central Powers\n\nThe first peace treaty of World War I is signed when the newly declared independent state of Ukraine officially comes to terms with the Central Powers at 2 a.m. in Berlin, Germany, on February 9, 1918.\n\nIn the treaty, the Central Powers, which included the governments of Austria-Hungary, Bulgaria, Germany and Turkey, formally recognized the independence of Ukraine from Russia. The Central Powers also agreed to provide military assistance and protection from the Bolshevik forces of Russia that were occupying Ukrainian territory. In exchange, the Ukrainian National Republic would provide 100 million tons of food rations to Germany.\n\nUkraine's journey toward a period of independence–brief as it proved to be–began shortly after the collapse of the Russian monarchy in March 1917. Led by Premier Vladimir Vinnichenko and War Minister Simon Petlura, Ukrainian political leaders declared the country a republic within Russia. However, after the Bolshevik Revolution, in which the post-monarchy provisional Russian government was overthrown, Vinnichenko proclaimed the complete independence of Ukraine in January 1918.\n\nBolshevik forces were sent to regain the Ukrainian territory, but after the peace treaty between the Ukraine and the Central Powers was signed, the Russians were forced out by German troops. Within one month of the peace treaty, Russia formally recognized the independence of Ukraine as part of the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk it signed with the Central Powers on March 3, 1918. In 1919, though, during the Russian Civil War, the Soviet Union regained the Ukrainian territory and Ukraine became one of the original republics of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR).\n\nCitation Information\n\nArticle Title\n\nAuthor\n\nWebsite Name\n\nURL\n\nAccess Date\n\nPublisher\n\nA&E Television Networks\n\nLast Updated\n\nFebruary 6, 2020\n\nOriginal Published Date\n\nNovember 5As no presidential candidate received a majority of electoral votes in the election of 1824, the U.S. House of Representatives votes to elect John Quincy Adams, who won fewer votes than Andrew Jackson in the popular election, as president of the United States.

{"text": "Do you actively speak at industry conferences? Is your business listed on vendor comparison websites? Is your website visible in Google search?\n\nIf you answered 'No' to any of the questions above, then chances are that your potential customers simply won't find you.\n\nSaid another way… If you don't base your strategy on the customer journey, you will lose out on new business.\n\nThis week we are diving into creating a profitable customer journey. One thing about journeys is that you need to focus on identifying who your audience is to know what to sell to them.\n\nInvest in them, know your audience, and make sure you segment them properly. Once you know who these people are and what makes them \"tick,\" you'll be able to sell to them.\n\nOur comprehensive guide introduces basic concepts that you can incorporate into your larger business strategy.\n\nWhat Is A Customer Journey Map?\n\nIn the late '90s and early 2000s, digital marketers' understanding of the consumer buying process was heavily based on the traditional, linear customer funnel – which is now obsolete.\n\nToday, marketers understand that the path to purchase is not as linear as the funnel model would have us believe.\n\nThe customer journey map is almost a mythical creature. There is no one map. There is not even a single map for any given business.\n\nThe customer journey is too complicated to allow that. It might be more accurate to say that a business owner needs a map to find a way through the maze of customer journey mapping.\n\nA customer journey consists of all of the steps that a customer takes when interacting with a company to achieve a particular goal.\n\nIt should be a visual representation of all the interactions, touchpoints, and success milestones the customer has with your company and product, from the point of purchase through renewal.\n\nIt includes interactions through various devices, channels, and touchpoints that your brand uses across each stage of the customer lifecycle — from awareness to loyalty.\n\nIt focuses on the customers' experiences and priorities, step-by-step, instead of looking at the customer journey from your company's perspective.\n\nYou're dealing with two types of people in the awareness stage — those who are aware they have a problem but don't know the solution or people who don't even know they have a problem.\n\nDuring this stage, it's not advisable to tell your audiences to take out their wallets to make a purchase. Hard selling is better suited for the next stages.\n\nThe customer journey gives you a roadmap of how your audiences see your business, leading you through every customer point of contact.\n\nWhen you're mapping out your customer success journey, the most important thing to remember is that you're mapping your customer's journey to success, so you need to look at the milestones, goals, and steps from your customer's perspective.\n\nIf your map seems overly complex or you're overwhelmed at the idea of having to revisit it, review these tips for simplifying your customer journey map.\n\nCustomer journeys have become more elaborate, making journey maps more vital than ever.\n\nUnlike many business trends, customer journey maps will remain valuable no matter how the times change.\n\nRegardless of technology advancements or industry shifts, a journey map can always adapt to provide the customer experience that will convert.\n\nShare the map with your entire organization. The map you create will likely touch on every part of your business.\n\nThat's why you should share it with different departments. Customer service, sales, and marketing should be the first departments on your list.\n\nThe information that customer journey maps provide can help them determine the resources required to create a better customer experience.\n\nMapping out the customer journey is important in establishing your success strategy.\n\nUse the six steps we shared in this article to create your customer success journey map.\n\nWhile steps one through five are essential for creating a customer journey map, step six is where you can take your customer support to the next level.\n\nThe most important thing to remember when mapping out the customer journey is to look at each step from your customers' perspective, and keep their goals and priorities in mind.\n\nHow To Create A Customer Journey Map\n\nProvide seamless customer-centric experiences with your brand with these proven tips on mapping a customer journey.\n\nPredict Customer Behavior\n\nNot having a customer journey map is akin to leaving a horse out on a grassy field — it can aimlessly run amok.\n\nHowever, plotting a journey map is like putting a horse on a racetrack. The only viable direction is forward.\n\nYou wouldn't want your customers to run amok aimlessly, would you?\n\nBe extra mindful of stages where your leads fall off, or your customers click away. Chances are they didn't leave your marketing funnel for no reason.\n\nSomething triggered them to leave, and your job is to find that something and address it.\n\nSubscribe For Exclusive Content\n\nStephen Twomey", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "f3a5a4aa-d500-4216-a98b-b77de6507302", "url": "https://kennected.org/customer-journey/"}

{"text": "[Infographic] Four Phases Of Data Recovery\n\nThe Essence of Data Recovery\n\nData recovery means retrieving lost, deleted, unusable or inaccessible data that is lost for various reasons; Data recovery not only restores lost files but also recovers corrupted data; Data recovery is necessary when the source drive fails and there is no good back up. Data Recovery Tools including data recovery hardware and data recovery software are important to use correctly to the corresponding failures.\n\nDownload Dolphin Data Lab Product Catalog Here\n\nThe source drive can fail for two reasons\n\nOne – damage to the media and the pre-existing data needs to be retrieved. This normally requires the media to be repaired. Media is the Service Area damage, platter damage, head damage or electronic damage to the PCB. For these damages, users need to use firmware repair kits, head and platter swap hardware kits and other repair kits ; Two – files were purposely or accidentally deleted and there is no damage to the media. For these damage, users can use data recovery software kits to recover the data.\n\nPhase 1: Repair the hard drive\n\nRepair the hard drive so it is running in some form, this means: if heads are bad they need to be changed, if the PCB has problems it needs to be fixed or replaced, if the spindle motor is bad the platters and heads are moved to a new donor drive.\n\nAll work on the internal mechanics of the hard drive are done in a clean environment.\n\nHard drives fail for a number of reasons\n\nHeads are bad and can no longer read the media;\n\nThe spindle motor no longer turns the platters and the heads can not read the media;\n\nThe PCB ROM is corrupted and the drive can no longer perform initialization;\n\nThe modules in the Service Area have become corrupted and the disk no longer can be initialized;\n\nThe SMART modules has over flow with too many errors;\n\nThe G-List is full and no more errors can be added to the G-List;\n\nThe drive has been dropped and the platters are out of alignment;\n\nHeads have touched down on the platter and not on the landing zone.\n\nDifferent failures requires different data recovery tools, Dolphin Data Lab cannot right now offer all the tools to fix all the problems but we can offer the latest data recovery tools with the latest technologies for most of the failures. users can check our available data recovery tools here from our online data recovery shopping system.\n\nPhase 2: Image the drive to a new drive.\n\nWhen a hard drive fails for one reason or another the importance of getting the data off the drive is top priority. It is not possible to work on any drive prior to imaging the drive. If the data is lost from the operator deleting files the first operations in finding these files is from an image of the hard drive. Never work on a drive that has failed or has deleted files on it. Always work from an image of this drive.\n\nPhase 3: Logical Recovery of files, partition, MBR, and MFT.\n\nAfter the drive has been cloned to a new drive it is possible to retrieve the files from the drive. With Logical Recovery the drive has failed for a number of reasons. Using the clone it is possible to repair the partition table, MBR, and MFT to read the data structure on the drive again and retrieve the data.\n\nPhase 4: Repair the damaged files that were retrieved.\n\nDamage to files can be caused when the file is written to a sector on the drive that was damaged. In a failing drive this is most common and files need to be reconstructed in order to open the file and read the file again. Corrupted documents can be recovered by several software methods or physically reconstructing the document using a hex editor.\n\nDolphin Data Lab is now offering the worldwide client not only professional latest data recovery tools but comprehensive data recovery solutions and premium data recovery consultation by our data recovery specialists with years' experience in this field.", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "72146ae4-c8cc-49f8-b625-c3202b0c198c", "url": "https://www.dolphindatalab.com/the-four-phases-of-data-recovery/"}
{"text": "I recently did a show that consisted of several scenes, many of which used real-time fx paired with a kinect azure to create interactive visuals with a performer. While the show went well and the client was happy (hooray!), the show ran at about 70% speed, judging by the bpm of the audio file (only perceptible when kinect skeleton is active). I'm wondering what the best practices are to manage resource use in this scenario?\n\nI'm particularly confused about the resource load of inactive nodes/scenes. My gpu (rtx 3080 laptop) can handle any of these scenes with kinect tracking individually just fine. But even when there is no output from certain nodes/scenes/layers, they still have a serious effect on gpu load, making my system unable to handle the particular scene that it would otherwise blaze through. Is there some way around this? I also tried some things like pre-rendering scenes into .mp4 and having them play on image planes, and decreasing intensive operations like field density and optical flow.\n\nI would upload a dfx, but unfortunately I always get errors when trying to upload on this site. Not sure what that's about. Here's a link to a google drive folder where you can download the dfx and assets. The show is arranged so that the nodes progress chronologically in a clockwise manner around the root node. I originally had it separated into layers, but noticed this did not offer a performance boost when layers were deactivated (re: inactive scenes mentioned above) and only gave me more trouble with layer animation than it was worth in organization. \n\nI too have noticed that \"inactive\" layers actually are active from a performance standpoint, or at least that seems to be the case with various scenes. Perhaps it's a memory issue?\n\nIt would be wonderful if someone from the Notch team could document this in a way that informs users in the software manual, or point us in that direction, for anyone reviewing this thread down the road…\n\nI think this is what I'm getting at, if I understand you correctly. Both inactive layers and nodes that have been made to be inactive, whether through the \"active\" slider set to 0 or other means, such as turning emission to 0 on particle primitive emitter. I guess what I'm looking for is an animation friendly \"full off\" property for both layers and nodes that either eliminates or nearly eliminates their impact on gpu load, as it seems that nodes made inactive through the methods I suggested above still have an significant resource requirement.\n\nTo get this out of the way first… BUILDER IS NOT A LIVE PERFORMANCE TOOL.\nNotch has been engineered so that editor usability is the focus while in Builder, not performance - and definitely not smoothness of performance.\n\nThe main reason Standalone and Block exports exist is to provide much better run-time performance for Notch projects - by removing all of the UI, editability, undo stack, copy/paste and all those other niceties that are not needed for playback. Various parts of the scene are flattened & baked down. Shaders are precompiled and cached. It uses less memory, and it's able to manage memory better because there are constraints on what can happen at any time during execution. It has a more linear, constrained relationship with time. It warms caches. It's engineered for performance & smoothness, not for editability.\n\nFor example, when you hide a node in Builder, Builder doesn't know if you're about to unhide the node again - so it needs to keep any memory used for it around for a bit to see what happens. Block/Standalone exports on the other hand can pretend hidden nodes never existed in the first place and just give that memory up.\n\nNow that's out of the way, a bit about memory usage…\nMemory for imported resources is allocated up front and resources remain resident in memory (except for streams/video).\nMost nodes use negligable amounts of memory in themselves as they're just parameters, but their actions may use memory. For example, a deformer on an object requires memory to process; particles and fields need memory to store simulation data. This can run to gigs of memory as things can be so huge. Usually the root node for the simulation is responsible for the memory; e.g. Particle Root stores all the particles, Emitter nodes just tell them how to appear. So hiding a Particle Emitter won't change memory usage but hiding the Particle Root will.\n\nMemory is allocated for particles and other effects on demand from pools. Some is given back immediately (e.g. temporary buffers during post fx or deformers); some is kept around, e.g. simulations. Simulation memory is only given up with the simulation ends, its parent layer ends or you switch layer so it's no longer visible (and there are different rules in Builder vs in an export, as discussed above).\n\nIt's worth understanding the difference between the ways in which nodes can be made inactive / ended.\n\nBy switching layer or ending the parent layer\n\nBy hiding the node\n\nCropping timeline bar\n\nThe \"Active\" slider\n\n\"Other means\" (setting emission to 0 etc).\n\nIf you switch layer or the parent layer ends, all memory used by nodes in the layer will be released. If a layer is inactive or out of time range, none of its nodes will be executed or evaluated. Using multiple layers and switching between those layers is a very efficient way to manage performance and memory.\n\nIf you hide the node, it's like the node doesn't exist anymore. This enables the system to clean up any resources used by the node. In Builder this is not done immediately for reasons listed above, but in standalone/blocks it is.\n\nCropping the time bar is the most efficient way of controlling node activity over time. If the time bar has reached its end, in Standalone/Block the system knows that the effect is over and can chuck it away.\n\nThe Active slider, and \"other means\", will stop the effect from executing but they won't give its memory back. That's because they're just parameters - you could just switch them on again and need the effect back, so we cant chuck it away. That said, generally if a node is never started (because it's active slider is always 0) it never consumes memory in the first place.\nLayer Precomps are an exception as they have an option to release memory when they're inactive.\n\nThe best way to manage lots of effects / elements is to split them into separate layers, and crop time bars of the nodes and layers (if you're working on a linear timeline) or switch between those layers as needed (if you're working dynamically or in a media server).\n\nIf you're working in a media server host, the media server usually tells Notch its layer has ended at appropriate times (e.g. when switching track / disabling the layer).\n\nWow, this is a great breakdown and explanation of the inner workings of the software. I understand why blocks and standalone would be best for show use. I'll keep all of this in mind moving forward.\n\nHowever, I'm not sure memory (as far as RAM is concerned) is the issue. I have 32gb on my system, and during the show I rarely reach 70% usage. What seems to be happening is the frame rate gets quite low when the gpu usage hits 100%. This is an obvious result, but my concern is that it hits 100% gpu much more quickly when there are lots of inactive nodes (by any means, including being hidden, layers, or timeline crop) than if I am just running that specific effect and active nodes alone. I'm wondering if there is any way to mitigate this, and especially if that method can be animated. Unfortunately I'm an independent artist and can't always afford to upgrade for a month for personal projects.\n\nRegarding particle systems : to minimise memory consumption and resources in general, minimise the number of Particle Root nodes - particularly if you have large particle counts. (For small particle counts, don't worry about it.)\n\nThe particle system is very flexible and it's often possible to combine multiple particle effects into a single particle root. You can put multiple emitters under a single particle root, and particles will be allocated to them on demand: if an emitter is disabled/made inactive/emission set to 0 it stops grabbing particles, allowing another one to grab them instead. This makes it considerably more efficient than using multiple Particle Roots for this purpose.\n\nYou can combine entirely different particle effects under one particle root. If you want a certain particle renderer to only render the particles of certain emitters, or a particle effector to only effect certain emitters, all of the nodes have \"Rendered Emitters\" / \"Affected Emitters\" inputs to filter them. Or, if you want a renderer to only render particles from a single emitter, parent the renderer directly to the emitter.\n\nThink of a Particle Root as just a \"particle container\".\n\nNote that it's also important to minimise the number of particles set on the Particle Root. If you have a Particle Root with 1 million particles and you only ever use 100 of them, you're still allocating for 1 million. Check the particle metrics and reduce the number on the Particle Root accordingly. (Affectors/renderers generally do reduce workloads by compacting the set of particles they work on, but there's still a computation overhead if you over-size the container.)", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "91232e3e-b412-4a48-8e2e-175aa14255e8", "url": "https://forum.notch.one/t/real-time-show-efficiency-best-practices/2185"}

Below is that family gingerbread cookie recipe:\n\nIngredients:\n\n8oz plain flour\n\n2 level teaspoon ground ginger or less if you like it less strong\n\n1/2 level teaspoon bicarbonate\n\n3 ozs butter\n\n4 ozs soft brown sugar or caster sugar\n\n5ozs golden syrup\n\nDirections:\n\nSet oven to gas 4 or 180 C/350 F\n\nSieve dry ingredients.\n\nMelt syrup and butter together.\n\nStir in sugar and add melted butter and no syrup.\n\nKnead together lightly till it is no longer sticky.\n\nRoll out thinly on a floured surface and stamp out with cutters.\n\nPlace on baking sheets.\n\nBake in the centre of the oven for 12 – 15 mins until cooked.\n\nCool on a wire rack.\n\nThese keep in an airtight tin for 1 – 2 weeks. Enjoy!\n\nLikewise, junior JP Johnson has his own special holiday baking traditions. He says every year, \"My family always makes Dr. Pepper chocolate cake. We have to go way out in the countryside of Texas to find the cake mix.\" Although he does not have the specific recipe to share, his intriguing comments have led me to include a similar recipe:\n\nPreheat the oven to 350-degrees F and grease or spray with cooking spray a 13x9x2-inch baking pan.\n\nBegin by combining the Dr. Pepper, oil, butter and cocoa powder in a saucepan over medium heat. When it comes to a simmer, mix well and turn the stove off.\n\nMix dry ingredients together (sugar, flour and baking soda), add to mixture in saucepan and mix well by hand, being extra careful to not overbeat the batter.\n\nIn a separate small bowl, lightly beat the eggs and buttermilk together, then add them to the saucepan and combine batter well by hand. But again, do not over beat.\n\nPour into a greased baking pan and bake at 350-degrees F for approx. 23-28 minutes or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean. Be careful not to over bake.\n\nFor the frosting:\n\nIn a saucepan, combine butter, cocoa powder and milk together over medium heat, stirring occasionally until melted and smooth.\n\nAdd in the powdered sugar a little at a time, combining after each addition until smooth.\n\nPour over the warm cake. Enjoy.\n\nSome winter baking ideas on the internet included, but are not limited to sugar cookies, caramels, old fashioned gingerbread, creme brulee, Christmas pinwheel cookies, homemade Hanukkah gelt, holiday sticky buns, apple spice cake, figgy pudding, and holiday biscotti. The Martha Stewart Website, Food Network, and Allrecipes contain the recipes for each of these desserts for those that are interested.\n\nAll in all, it is exciting to try new recipes and examine the depth of culture and tradition behind every holiday confection. As the weather gets colder and you spend more time indoors, perhaps you will consider baking one of these winter desserts that will warm your holiday season.", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "60e10892-6b6b-44d4-97ae-4965df3bd3e5", "url": "https://ihsjournalism.online/5114/features/traditional-holiday-recipes/"}

{"text": "How To Make Fruit Bouquets a fruit bouquet?\n\nHow do you preserve fruit for a fruit bouquet homemade edible arrangements?\n\nHow do you cut a fruit bouquet?\n\nUsing the cookie cutters, cut 1-inch slices from the watermelon, cantaloupe, honeydew melon, and pineapple. You don't need to peel anything, since you're cutting shapes from the slices. Cut out pink hearts from the watermelon and flowers from the cantaloupe, pineapple, and honeydew.\n\nHow do you cut a pineapple for a fruit bouquet?\n\nWhich flower are edible?\n\nOct 5, 2020. BY: Kritika Pushkarna. …\n\nViola. It's the most popular flower when it comes to garnishings. …\n\nRose. Rose has a subtle and fruity flavour with a strong floral scent. …\n\nHibiscus. …\n\nMoringa. …\n\nLotus. …\n\nBanana Blossoms. …\n\nJasmine.\n\nHow long does a fruit bouquet last?\n\nKeeping the fruits at room temperature allows them to remain fresh for 2 to 3 weeks. We can prolong the life span of citrus fruits by putting them inside a tightly closed container before placing them inside the refrigerator, where they usually last for up to a month or more.\n\nHow long will a edible arrangement last?\n\nOur chocolate dipped fruit is exceptionally fresh, and should be consumed immediately. If that's not possible, you should keep the original packaging, refrigerate immediately upon receipt, and enjoy within 24 hours of receipt.\n\nHow do you make edible chocolate bouquets?\n\nWhat chocolate is used for edible arrangements?\n\nWe use only 100% real gourmet chocolate in every product. For our dipped fruit arrangements, every piece of fruit is carefully hand-dipped in Artisia semisweet or white chocolate.\n\nWhat do all fruits have in common?\n\nBotanically, a fruit is a mature ovary and its associated parts. It usually contains seeds, which have developed from the enclosed ovule after fertilization, although development without fertilization, called parthenocarpy, is known, for example, in bananas.\n\nHow do you cut a pineapple into a heart?\n\nStart by slicing your pineapple into 3/4 inch to 1 inch thick disks. You should get about 8 pineapple disks to work with. We used the Rada Slicer. Use your heart-shaped cookie cutters to cut a heart through the middle of each disk.\n\nHow do you cut a star shaped pineapple?\n\nSince pineapple can be a bit tough in the center, it's easiest to try and cut around it, not through. If you do need to cut through the center, you can always use a knife if the cookie cutter isn't strong enough. (The cutter will still make a good imprint on the pineapple so that you know where to cut.)\n\nWhat is the pineapple shape?\n\nCylindrical in shape has a tough diamond pattern skin and spine, cactus like leaves and a sweet, yellow, tangy fibre like flesh that is quite juicy with a characteristic fragrance.\n\nWhich flower is not edible?\n\nAnemone is also commonly known as thimbleweed, windflower and pasqueflower. Anemone is a perennial herb that comes in many colors, including yellowish-green, white, purple and red. The flowers originate in Asia, Europe and North America. All parts of the anemone, when fresh, are poisonous and therefore non-edible.\n\nAre daffodils edible?\n\nAs daffodils are considered one of the most popular spring flowers, it is important to know that parts of the daffodil are toxic to humans. … Symptoms of daffodil poisoning include nausea, vomiting, dizziness, burning, diarrhea and, in more severe cases, convulsions.\n\nAre rose petals poisonous?\n\nSo far, we've established that rose petals are not toxic to humans or pets. … Even though you don't come close to eating rose thorns, and they're not poisonous per se, they pose another kind of risk if you prick your finger in one.\n\nDo fruit baskets need to be refrigerated?\n\nYour fruits can sit out on the countertop in a basket without requiring refrigeration. The only fruits that need to be refrigerated are berries and fruits that have been cut.\n\nIs an edible arrangement appropriate for a funeral?\n\nAppropriate for gatherings such as wakes and funeral services, this arrangement features a delicious assortment of our fresh fruit favorites, plus our gourmet chocolate covered strawberries.\n\nHow do you stop strawberries from sweating?\n\nTo avoid sweating or leaking, it's best to make chocolate covered strawberries the same day you plan to serve them. But the good news is, they will keep at room temperature for as long as 10 hours, without a problem. What is this? Just leave them in a cool, dry place, uncovered, on a parchment-lined baking sheet.\n\nShould you refrigerate strawberries?\n\nFresh strawberries can go directly into the refrigerator, but will do just fine on the counter for a couple of days. … Strawberries will soak up the water, making them more susceptible to spoilage. Even with careful handling, strawberries won't last longer than a few days without refrigeration.\n\nCan I freeze edible fruit?\n\nIn fact, you can keep them for up to three months in the freezer. … Once the berries are solid, you can place them in a freezer container or bag. When you're ready to enjoy them, defrost your chocolate covered strawberries in the fridge for an hour. Or, you can choose to eat the strawberries frozen.\n\nWhy are my chocolate covered strawberries sweating?\n\nWhat are the 4 types of fruits?\n\nFruits are classified according to the arrangement from which they derive. There are four types—simple, aggregate, multiple, and accessory fruits.\n\nWhat is the difference between eatable and edible?\n\nEdible and eatable both refer to something that is \"able to be eaten,\" but edible is usually used to describe something that is safe to eat, without regard to taste, while eatable often describes something that has some level of acceptable flavor.\n\nIs Plum A true fruit?\n\nTrue Fruits\n\nBy definition, a fruit is a seed plant's mature ovary, surrounding a simple seed. True fruits include cherries, plums, and peaches. There are multiple types of true fruits. … Berry, which has a fleshy ovary and one to many seeds.\n\nHow do you make a sweet box bouquet?\n\nHow do you put Ferrero in a bouquet?\n\nStep 2: Grab the tissue paper squares and fold each of them diagonally at an angle. Wrap each stick with tissue paper and secure the bottom edge with tape. Step 3: Repeat step 2 with teal tissue paper.

{"text": "Once you choose hope, anything's possible.\n\nHelen Keller, once said: \"Optimism is the faith that leads to achievement. Nothing can be done without hope and confidence.\"\n\nDo not lose hope, believe in yourself, your abilities, and your inner strength. To be optimistic means to know that it is not over yet and there are more opportunities ahead as long as you don't give up and aim to achieve your goals.\n\nThere are two options: to hope for the best or to give up. However, is giving up really going to widen the opportunities?\n\nBeing realistic is the key. Wish for the best but calculate each and every factor as well. Don't expect a miracle without working for it. Miracles happen when we work for them. It might test your patience level to believe that something was meant for you and that you can make it happen, but sooner or later, you will see positive results if you believe it is. Do not give up and keep doing what you are doing, and keep hoping for the best.\n\nGiving up fixes nothing\n\nDon't give up because doing so will not make your life better, and it won't help you to feel better either.\n\nGet comfortable with the challenge, let it push your boundaries. Overcoming difficulties is what makes us better, and there is a great deal of joy in overcoming them. The more you go through them, the more you are able to solve them.\n\nHowever difficult life may seem, there is always something you can do and succeed at. – Stephen Hawking\n\nEveryone is unique and special, we each have our own strengths and weaknesses, so identify them and work on them. Do what makes you great and fulfilled, and let your works add value to the lives of others.\n\nDespite how challenging it can be, there is always a way. The key is to never give up and to find out another solution that truly works. And so, when you choose hope, naturally you start looking for ways to overcome challenges.\n\nWe shouldn't stress over the little things in life; we should acknowledge them as part of life, and realize that we cannot avoid them. Sometimes accepting things is more important than changing them, because we can't control everything.\n\nDo not let fear or negative self-talk restrict your vision. If a failure occurs, then let it happen since attempting something is far more important than not attempting anything at all. Accept failure, learn from it, for in doing so you will open a new door for yourself and may even change the direction of your life. This does not mean you should always fail at something; it means you should learn from them in order to avoid making the same mistakes again.\n\nOnce you choose hope, you automatically gain the courage to make anything possible\n\nFaith and optimism are very powerful, they bring a positive influence and help to open up or create new pathways. You have to believe in yourself and know your inner strengths since nothing great has ever been achieved when you have a negative attitude.\n\nIt is important to find the courage to support yourself regardless of what happens in your life. If it is the darkness, don't close your eyes, instead, keep searching for the source of light. Getting out of a negative situation is as simple as finding the solution and working on it. Running away from it won't help you in the long run.\n\nYou will face many defeats in life, but never let yourself be defeated. – Maya Angelou\n\nIt's inevitable that we will fail when we try something new. Accept the failure, improve your skills, and try again. Don't let failure derail your plans. Keep striving for success, no matter how uncertain things may seem at the time.\n\nThere is one great quote by Marilyn Monroe: \"Keep smiling, because life is a beautiful thing and there's so much to smile about.\"\n\nI believe that life is a beautiful gift, with many periods of uncertainty with ups and downs. That's what it is, it is unpredictable, but embrace it and keep looking for a ray of hope.\n\nNever let your overthinking turn simple things into complicated ones. Control your mind and you'll control your thoughts. Don't think about negative outcomes without finding a way to overcome them. In tough situations, train your mind to focus on finding a way around.\n\nBelieve in yourself and don't lose hope – almost anyone can overcome any kind of obstacle if they work hard enough.\n\nLife is really simple, but we insist on making it complicated. – Confucius", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "8c34d2d9-8109-4b5a-ba05-66f43829c15d", "url": "https://www.setquotes.com/once-you-choose-hope-anythings-possible/"}

{"text": "Art from the Holocaust\n\nBy now, it is com­mon­place, near­ly reflex­ive, to say that art pro­duced by tar­gets of the Holo­caust tes­ti­fies to the dig­ni­ty of the human spir­it. Indeed, sim­i­lar sen­ti­ments are expressed in some of the essays that pref­ace the excel­lent Art from the Holo­caust: 100 Art­works from the Yad Vashem Col­lec­tion. The art­work itself pro­vides an oppor­tu­ni­ty to refine and clar­i­fy that statement.\n\nThese hun­dred paint­ings and draw­ings, expert­ly cho­sen from the vast col­lec­tion of Yad Vashem, rep­re­sent a sam­ple of the out­put pro­duced by res­i­dents of the ghet­tos, work camps, and death camps. Approx­i­mate­ly half of the artists fea­tured did not survive.\n\nWe may be aston­ished to find that the Holo­caust scarce­ly reg­is­ters in these pieces. Cer­tain­ly it dom­i­nates the sub­ject mat­ter, but when con­sid­er­ing the work as art, the view­er could be look­ing at a sur­vey from the peri­od devot­ed to any theme. The artists can be rough­ly divid­ed into naïve and pro­fes­sion­al cat­e­gories. The naïve make the pic­tures that naïve artists make: clum­sy and sin­cere depic­tions of what lies before them. The image is deformed, but what is intend­ed is clear. The pro­fes­sion­al artists, by con­trast, pre­cise­ly reflect the state of the artis­tic dis­course at the time the art was made. We see both work that is nos­tal­gic for the real­ist tra­di­tions of the nine­teenth cen­tu­ry and work that is influ­enced by dif­fer­ent strains of the mod­ernist project. Some artists turn to sen­ti­men­tal­i­ty akin to Chagall's, oth­ers to the sul­furous com­e­dy of a Kokosch­ka-like out­look or to Matisse's lyri­cal min­i­mal­ism, and still oth­ers to the satir­i­cal line draw­ing styles com­mon in cen­tral Europe in the 1930s. Traces of Cezanne, Picas­so, Fechin, Koll­witz, Schiele, and Lada abound — not because the artists mim­ic them, but because these styl­is­tic and the­mat­ic tropes were in the air.\n\nOne might expect the artists to slav­ish­ly record the details, to pro­vide tes­ti­mo­ny so that this mon­strous inter­val should nev­er be for­got­ten. And indeed, at the lev­el of nar­ra­tive and con­tent, the artists seek to do that. But they large­ly fail to devel­op the util­i­tar­i­an eyes of war illus­tra­tors or court­room sketch artists. Even in the midst of the black­est night, these artists can­not stop func­tion­ing as artists. Their sub­ject a giv­en, they spend their nar­row time and mate­r­i­al resources refin­ing their styles, work­ing on con­tem­po­rary prob­lems in aes­thet­ics, and pars­ing their envi­ron­ments for excit­ing artis­tic opportunities.\n\nThis is per­haps the real tri­umph of the human spir­it: not to go on mak­ing art in the face of the abyss, but to go on mak­ing art that is part and par­cel of the artis­tic dis­course. It declines to be defined by the cru­cible of its cre­ation. It refus­es to be impov­er­ished by its cir­cum­stance or to become alien­at­ed from beau­ty and joy. It tes­ti­fies to the per­sis­tence of an ordi­nary vivac­i­ty, up to and beyond the bit­ter end. It is a cred­it to the Jew­ish peo­ple, and, one hopes, human­i­ty at large.\n\nThe book includes sev­er­al for­wards and essays, and clear, help­ful notes on each image and its maker.\n\nDaniel Maid­man is a writer and artist liv­ing in Brook­lyn.

{"text": "If you've sustained injuries due to an incident that wasn't entirely your fault, you might be eligible to make a claim for financial compensation. Consider you are attacked by a dog while walking outside. After ensuring that you have received proper medical care, you should reach out to your lawyer. Before speaking to the dog owner or their insurance representative, you need legal advice from a lawyer who handles dog bite cases. A skilled dog bite lawyer will negotiate with the insurance company to ensure you get fair compensation. They will help you file a lawsuit against the pet's owner and pursue a claim against them.\n\nWhen you're taking legal action, however, it's important to have the right representation in place. If you're considering making a compensation claim, take a look at these top tips for hiring a personal injury lawyer now:\n\n1. Work with a Local Expert\n\nLaws and procedures differ from one state to another, which is why it can be advantageous to hire a lawyer who has in-depth local knowledge. If you've sustained a workplace injury in Illinois, for example, you'll want to hire a top-rated Chicago attorney to access the bespoke advice you need. Many people sustain injuries relatively close to where they live or work but if you happen to be hurt while visiting a different town, city or state, hiring a personal injury lawyer with local knowledge will ensure you can access the best advice.\n\n2. Find a Specialist\n\nPersonal injury law is a vast area, which means that there are many different types of personal injury claims that can be made. As you might expect, some attorneys focus on specific practice areas, such as industrial accidents or aviation disasters. If you want to maximize your chances of making a successful claim, choose an attorney such as Savannah personal injury lawyer who has plenty of experience in handling the type of personal injury claim you need to make. Their expertise will have a significant impact on the outcome of your claim, so it's worth working with a lawyer who is known for their specialism in a particular practice area.\n\n3. Consider the Cost\n\nMany people are wary about taking legal action because they assume it will be an expensive process. However, enforcing your rights shouldn't be dependent on your financial circumstances. When you work with a personal injury firm that advances all costs, you can ensure that you won't be required to pay anything upfront. Commonly referred to as, 'no-win, no-fee' agreements, this type of arrangement can mean that you won't be required to pay anything at all unless or until your claim is successful and you have received compensation.\n\n4. Track Their Success Rate\n\nIf you want to maximize your chances of obtaining compensation, choose a personal injury lawyer who has an impressive track record. When you know your attorney has successfully represented clients in a similar position to you, you can be confident that they have the expertise and experience to handle your claim efficiently and appropriately. Not only will this increase your chances of obtaining compensation, but it can ensure that you receive a maximum amount of compensation too.\n\nIs It Worth Making a Compensation Claim?\n\nWhen you've sustained injuries or harm due to an accident that was partly or totally caused by someone else, you shouldn't have to deal with the consequences alone. By hiring a personal injury lawyer and making a claim, you can ensure that you receive the financial recompense you're entitled to", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "337ec35d-bc68-4cec-abb8-228a25b58afc", "url": "https://complextime.com/hiring-a-personal-injury-lawyer-what-you-need-to-know/"}

{"text": "Laurie Baker – The Gandhi Of Architecture\n\nLaurie Baker – The Gandhi Of Architect ...\n\nLaurence Baker is the pioneer of vernacular architecture. It inspires one to use locally available construction materials and traditional building methods. These kinds of architecture are low-cost and highly energy efficient.\n\nLaurie Baker used naturally occurring local materials to construct sustainable buildings. Laurie Baker found the urgency to build buildings that are highly energy-efficient long before global warming was a global concern. Gandhi's speeches on the usage of local materials in construction deeply moved him and inspired him.\n\nHe was not inclined to the usage of concrete in construction. One of the main constituents of concrete is cement. Yet it is the most hazardous construction material for the environment. Baker did not have any plans drafted using a similar formula for every situation. Instead, he created unconventional construction methods on-site meeting the requirements of his clients.\n\nBakers' choice of construction materials changed based on the purpose of each project. He improved, innovated, and improvised at every stage of construction.\n\nSome Of The Construction Techniques Used By Laurie Baker\n\nLaurie Baker was the first person to have introduced the rat-trap bond in Kerala in the 1970s. It is a double-walled construction that reduces the cost of a building significantly. It minimizes the usage of mortar and acquires thermal efficiency without sabotaging the strength of the wall. The gap formed between the bricks due to the vertical alignment creates an internal cavity. This reduces the usage of construction materials by 30%. It nоt оnly сuts the соst оf the оverаll building but it аlsо yields thermаl energy аnd mаkes the аrсhiteсture eсоnоmiсаl аnd energy effiсient.\n\nSome of the other techniques used by him are utilizing filler slabs, arches, and domes. Arches and domes provide immense structural strength to a building.\n\nThe utilization of terracotta roofing and flooring is eco-friendly and has high durability. Using frameless doors and windows, brick jali walls, curved walls, latticed brick walls were some of the other commonly used building techniques used by Laurie Baker.\n\nBaker commonly used mud in his construction as it is highly energy-efficient and not at all harmful to the environment. He let the trees live by adapting them as a part of his design.", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "7b1cb2a1-3ad1-4671-9b50-61476e8a2035", "url": "https://arcounico.com/laurie-baker-the-gandhi-of-architecture/"}
{"text": "How NOT to Roast Meats Poultry Vegetables or Fish\n\nCommon Roasting Mistakes and How to Avoid Them\n\nEver since Man discovered fire, they have been roasting meat. The prehistoric man probably didn't realize why their roasted meat tasted so much better than its raw counterpart, but we know now. So we must know how to roast meats and vegetables to prepare great meals at home.\n\nMeats that have been properly roasted have a crisp, flavorful, deep brown exterior and a uniformly cooked interior. That crisp exterior is brought to you courtesy of Maillard reactions--enzymatic reactions that cause sugars and proteins to brown.\n\nCaramelization?\n\nSome cookbooks might call this browning caramelization, but caramelization refers to the browning of sugar alone when it is broken down by heat. The Maillard reactions are essential to developing the best flavor in roasted meats.\n\nLike baking, roasting has evolved over the centuries. Roasting is a dry heat cooking method characterized by relatively high heat and an uncovered pan.\n\nSpit roasting, or rotisserie, involves turning the meat over a flame, so all sides brown evenly while fats (typically drip down into the fire) baste the meat, keeping it moist.\n\nIn today's lexicon, roasting means to cook in an uncovered pan in an oven. To simulate a rotisserie in which the entire surface of the meat is cooked by radiation and convection, oven-roasted meats are often elevated on a rack to keep the bottom of the meat from resting in its own juices and steaming instead of roasting. Moisture is the enemy of a well-developed crust.\n\nSince moisture inhibits browning, but we want the interior of our roasts to be moist, it is understandable why many people have problems roasting correctly. We're going to look at some of the problems people encounter when roasting and solve them so you, too, can wow your family and friends with your roasting prowess.\n\nFirst, though, let's consider some of the variables inherent in roasting that aren't necessarily mistakes but personal preferences.\n\nRoasting Preferences - Up To You\n\nTo Sear or Not To Sear\n\nTo a large extent, searing helps to develop a roast's flavor. After all, the Maillard reactions produce all those wonderfully complex flavor compounds.\n\nWhen roasting a large cut of meat, such as a whole chicken, turkey, or prime rib, the meat will develop a nice sear because the meat must stay in the oven long enough to cook through. However, with smaller cuts, such as tenderloin, you might sear the meat on the stovetop before finishing it in the oven.\n\nFor a complete discussion of this method, see the chapter on Pan Roasting.\n\nTo Marinate or Not To Marinate\n\nMarinating and brining are two methods of introducing moisture and flavor to your meat before roasting. A marinade is a flavorful acidic solution that serves a couple of purposes.\n\nFirst, it can bring a lot of flavor to your meat.\n\nSecond, the acids can begin to denature, or chemically cook, the proteins on the outside of the meat, possibly resulting in a faster cooking time and minimizing the chance of the meat's drying out.\n\nThen There Is Brining\n\nA brine is a salt-based solution that imparts flavor deep into meat through osmosis. Unlike a marinade, brining brings about purely physical changes in the meat. Specifically, it carries salt and other flavorings into the meat cells.\n\nTo marinate or brine meat before roasting is entirely a personal choice. Some of the most beautiful roasts I've ever eaten have been seasoned with nothing more than salt and pepper.\n\nIf you do marinate or brine to add flavor and as a hedge against drying out, pay particular attention to drying off the meat before putting the meat in the oven. (See Mistake #4)\n\nBone or No Bone\n\nThe benefit of roasting on the bone is that your meat will have more flavor. The downside is that it takes longer to roast bone-in meat. However, if it is a question of time, you can up your meat's flavor profile by marinating or rubbing the meat with a spice blend.\n\nIf you prefer the unadulterated meat flavor and want to season, go ahead and spend the time roasting meat with the bone in. Either way, as long as you follow the rules listed in the rest of this chapter, you will end up with a beautifully roasted piece of meat.\n\nLarding and Barding\n\nLarding refers to lacing your roast with fat strips, running the fat in and out of the meat in a running stitch with a larding needle. This was a prevalent technique in past centuries for adding succulence to leaner cuts of meat.\n\nBut that was back in the day before we had ovens that we could hold at a specific temperature for a specified period of time. Today, larding is pretty much a thing of the past.\n\nTo bard, meat means to add flavor and fat to meat by laying strips of fat over the meat to be cooked. We still see many examples of barding today: meatloaf baked with strips of bacon on top, a fillet mignon wrapped in bacon; even bacon-wrapped scallops qualify.\n\nTo Tie or Not To Tie\n\nThe more even in thickness and uniform in size, your meat is, the more evenly it will roast. That's why, when roasting a whole tenderloin of beef, pork, or venison, tapered at one end, most recipes tell you to tuck the thin end of the loin underneath.\n\nRecipes that call for you to butterfly a large cut of meat--slice it so it lies flat like a book--and then stuff and rolls it up generally direct you to tie the meat at intervals to keep the stuffing in place.\n\nWhen deciding whether or not to tie your meat before cooking, consult your recipe. If you're not using a recipe, consider the shape of the meat. If tying it will help it hold a more uniform shape, you may tie it. But, again, unless the meat is stuffed, tying is a personal preference.\n\nHow About Trussing?\n\nRegarding poultry or game birds, some people like to tie or truss, their birds before cooking. This keeps the legs from flopping open and the wing tips from burning.\n\nIt also ensures that the meat comes out of the oven ready for the Thanksgiving table in that stereotypical \"bird shape.\" I tend not to truss my birds. I fold the wing tips up and back to prevent them from burning, but I prefer leaving the legs loose so that the thigh meat cooks more evenly.\n\nMistake #1: Oven too hot or too cold\n\nRoasting is primarily accomplished through radiant heat--heat waves directly penetrating the meat. If your oven is set too low, the meat won't properly brown, and your roast will not be very flavorful. On the other hand, if you set the oven temperature too high, the exterior of the meat can overcook and char before the interior gets cooked, leaving you with a blackened, dried-out mess.\n\nThe Fix -- Use Your Thermostat\n\nIf you have a thick piece of meat, such as a standing rib roast or a turkey, don't be afraid to adjust the temperature as you roast.\n\nStart roasting at a high temperature--475°F - 500°F is not unheard of--for the first fifteen minutes to ensure deep browning. Then, reduce the heat to 325°F - 350°F to let the meat finish roasting at a less harsh temperature.\n\nThe higher the heat, the more aggressively the heat waves penetrate the meat, and that could mean dry meat as the heat pushes the moisture out. However, once you have achieved optimal browning, there is no need to continue roasting at match speed.\n\nThere is an alternate method of dual-temperature roasting that I want to address as well. Rather than starting the roast in a high oven and then backing off the heat, you can also start the meat in a low oven and turn up the thermostat.\n\nThere is no wrong or right way, but know that there will be more carryover cooking with a start low/finish high method because there will be more of a thermal load that must dissipate once the meat is out of the oven.\n\nMistake #2: Putting the Meat Directly in the Pan\n\nAs stated earlier, roasting is a dry-heat cooking method. Therefore, it is in the roast's (and our) best interest to keep the meat as dry as possible when in the oven. Placing the meat directly in the pan inhibits browning on that part of your roast.\n\nEven if the meat and pan are dry, fats and juices will collect in your roasting pan. Suddenly, you find your meat in liquid, steaming rather than roasting. Since the temperature of the liquid won't exceed the boiling point, browning the submerged meat is impossible.\n\nThe Fix -- Use a Rack\n\nTo keep the meat out of the cooking liquids that accumulate in the bottom of the pan, it is essential to elevate the meat. This can be accomplished in a couple of ways.\n\nMany roasting pans come with a metal rack included. Spray with some pan spray and place the meat on the rack.\n\nIf your pan does not come with a rack, you have a few options: a flat rack or a V-rack. A flat rack is just that, a flat rack not unlike a cake cooling rack. A V-rack has a flat section at the bottom, and each side comes up at an angle.\n\nThe idea behind this type of rack is to help the meat keep its shape. They are trendy for roasting turkeys.\n\nI Like a V Rack\n\nOf course, the option is your own, but I find that meats roasted in V-racks take longer to cook because they are \"bunched up.\" This means you have to leave your meat in the oven longer and risk some portions being overcooked while waiting for the bunched-up portions to cook.\n\nI like to raise my meat off the bottom with an edible rack. Choose vegetables with flavors that will complement your meat and use them to build a platform for the meat to rest on.\n\nCelery sticks and whole carrots do an excellent job of this but don't discount fruits such as apples or citrus. Instead, cut them in half, skin on, and place them cut-side down in the pan.\n\nMistake #3: Taking the Meat from Fridge to Oven\n\nTaking a piece of meat straight from the refrigerator and putting it in a hot oven is a recipe for unevenly cooked meat. If you touch meat at refrigerator temperature--38°F--40F--the meat feels very firm.\n\nIt's literally uptight-- its proteins coiled very tightly. When that uptight meat hits a hot oven, it will contract, squeezing out the moisture and leaving you with a dry piece of meat.\n\nThe Fix -- Counter Time\n\nLetting the meat sit out on the counter for an hour, or even two, might sound unsafe, but it will give the meat a chance to relax and come closer to room temperature--shoot for around 70°F. If you are worried about surface bacteria, know that you will kill them in the oven.\n\nEven so, ensure you bring your meat straight home from the store and put it in the refrigerator. Better yet, take it home in a cooler. The idea is to minimize time spent in \"The Danger Zone,\" 41°F - 140°F, thus minimizing worry when your meat comes to room temperature.\n\nTouch the meat when it is at 70F. You'll find it to be much softer feeling and relaxed, and when you put it in the oven, it won't contract. The result? A juicy roast.\n\nMistake #4: Wet Meat\n\nAs stated in the introduction, moisture is the enemy of a well-developed crust. However, this doesn't mean you can't marinate or brine your meat before roasting unless you want a gray piece of meat. It requires an extra step many of us don't think to do.\n\nThe Fix--Dry It Off\n\nReally. To ensure that your meat has the best chance of developing a lovely, tasty crust, dry it off.\n\nAfter letting the meat rest on the counter and before putting it in the roasting pan, thoroughly pat it dry with paper towels or a washable, lint-free towel. The surface of the meat needs to reach at least 300°F for the Maillard reactions to occur, and moisture on the surface will stay at 212°F until it has evaporated.\n\nSave that step by removing the moisture before roasting. You'll end up with a nice sear without wasting time necessary for the water to evaporate.\n\nMistake #5: Wrong Cut of Meat\n\nNot all meat is created equal. Some cuts, usually those with muscles that do the most work, contain a lot of connective tissue that requires low, long, and slow liquid cooking to break that tissue down.\n\nMore tender cuts - those more toward the \"center\" of the animal - have less to no connective tissue that needs to be broken down. Just because you buy a piece of meat that looks like a roast doesn't mean that you can dry roast it.\n\nRoasting the wrong cut of meat will result in an extremely tough texture with chewy rubber band-like connective tissue running through it that is impossible to chew.\n\nThe Fix--Know Your Cuts\n\nStay away from words like chuck, round, or brisket. These cuts are at the animal's shoulder, hips, and front leg areas. This means that they do a lot of work when the animal moves and contain a lot of connective tissue.\n\nStick with cuts toward the animal's center: a rib, short loin, or loin is perfect for roasting. If you're not sure once you get to the grocery store or butcher, don't hesitate to ask for a cut appropriate for roasting. The butcher will be happy to help.\n\nMistake #6: Rushing to Serve\n\nRoasting involves the transfer of heat energy, and heat excites molecules. This means that it makes them move around very quickly. However, it also means that the energy needs a chance to dissipate so that the molecules calm down and stop careening about crazily.\n\nRight out of the oven, the meat juices are bubbling and have been partially squeezed out of the muscle cells. This means that if you cut the meat immediately, all those juices will spill all over your counter and leave your meat dry., which would be a shame after following all the rules to keep it juicy.\n\nThe Fix--Let It Rest\n\nThere are a couple of things to remember once your meat comes out of the oven.\n\nFirst, the juices are \"loose\" and bubbling around inside the meat.\n\nSecond, the temperature of the meat will continue to rise as the last of the oven heat pushes its way inside the meat.\n\nAllowing the meat to rest, covered, for at least fifteen minutes and up to 45 minutes for very large cuts (or Thanksgiving turkeys) allows for carryover cooking, letting the meat coast to its target temperature. It also allows time for the heat to dissipate naturally, allowing the juices to retreat back into the muscle cells.\n\nHere's the rule: take the meat out of the oven when it is five degrees shy of the target temperature (for smaller cuts) and ten degrees away from done (for larger cuts), and let it rest for a minimum of fifteen minutes. Follow this rule and you will be rewarded with perfectly done, juicy meat.\n\nMistake #7: Cutting with the Grain\n\nThe grain refers to the muscle fibers in the meat. Muscle fibers are generally long and thin and run in bunches parallel to each other.\n\nEven if you've followed all the other roasting rules and have a beautifully seared, perfectly done piece of meat, if you slice the meat along the grain, you will end up with chewy meat. By leaving the muscle fibers intact and long, you will feel like you are trying to chew rubber bands.\n\nThe Fix--Go Against the Grain\n\nSome cuts show their grain more easily than others. Look carefully at your cut before you put it in the oven, and notice the direction in which the lines of muscle fiber are running.\n\nOnce you remove the meat from the oven, make your cuts perpendicular to the grain. This has the effect of cutting the long fibers into short slices. And short muscle fibers equal tenderness.\n\nOne note about seasoning your meat:\n\nThere are a couple of different schools of thought regarding salting meats before roasting.\n\nSome chefs swear that your meat will taste much better if you salt it up to three days before cooking and at least 24 hours before. Others insist that you should salt right before cooking or even after cooking. But, of course, both ways have their own merits.\n\nSalting well before cooking will initially draw moisture out of the meat, but given time, it also flavors the meat more deeply because the salt has time to penetrate the muscle fibers.\n\nSalting right before cooking eliminates the problem of drawing out moisture and ensures a good sear. If you have time to salt 24 hours ahead, do so.\n\nDry the Roast or Ingredient\n\nJust be sure to pat the meat dry before cooking. If you don't have the time, don't worry about it. Go ahead and salt right before roasting, following all the roasting rules. Either way, you will have a beautiful roast to serve at the dinner table.\n\nDon't be afraid of roasting. Indeed, the oven does all the work for you. Just remember to:\n\npurchase the proper cut of meat\n\nmake sure you let it come to room temperature\n\npat it dry\n\nput it on a rack\n\nstart hot and end low\n\ntake the meat out below the target temperature and let it rest and\n\ncut across the grain to serve\n\nIf you follow the golden rules above, you will likely have a deliciously-made roast to serve to family and friends.", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "b7292747-78df-41c8-8516-e8d7057fadd5", "url": "https://www.reluctantgourmet.com/how-not-to-roast-1/"}

What did you do?\n\nInterview questions with sample answers\n\nHere are some sample answers to questions a hiring manager may ask during an interview for a call centre representative position:\n\nWhat three skills do you believe a call centre representative needs to be successful?\n\nHiring managers may ask this question to identify your strongest skills as a candidate. Your answer can highlight what qualities you value the most and help them determine what type of tasks you're best suited for. Try to incorporate both hard and soft skills in your answer to show that you're a well-rounded candidate.\n\nExample:\"A successful call centre representative has excellent communication skills, can solve problems effectively, and manage their time efficiently. Actively listening to customers and providing clear, concise answers can improve customer interactions. Call centre representatives who can quickly develop solutions for their customers and manage their time efficiently can also reduce wait time and improve customer satisfaction levels.\"\n\nWhat steps do you take to help solve a customer's issue?\n\nAn interviewer may ask you this question to learn more about how you approach problem-solving. Try to list specific steps to illustrate your process and focus on how you've helped customers overcome challenges in the past.\n\nExample:\"When a customer calls because they have an issue, I take the time to listen to their needs and ask clarifying questions to make sure I have all the information I need. I try to address the customer by name and maintain a calm demeanour to ease the tension so we can work together to find a solution that satisfies them.\n\nI also apologize for any inconvenience the issue may have caused while referring to the company guidelines to determine what I can do to improve the situation. Before I end the call, I always ask if there is anything else I can help the customer with. This ensures I've answered all their questions and gives me an opportunity to make sure they had a positive experience.\"\n\nCan you tell me about a time a customer was unsatisfied and what you did to improve the situation?\n\nCall centre representatives help customers overcome challenges every day, so it's important to communicate effectively with people who may be unsatisfied. Hiring managers may ask this question to determine whether you can remain professional, respectful, and helpful in these situations. Focus on how you tried to resolve the customer's issue and make their call a positive experience.\n\nExample:\"One of my customers was unhappy with the internet service he was receiving. I listened to his concerns, apologized for the inconvenience, and let him know I would be happy to research the issue. After learning more about his internet service, I realized his modem was several years old and very outdated, which was affecting his internet speed. I explained the issue and let him know that one of our representatives could come over that afternoon to replace the modem with an upgraded model.\n\nAt first, the customer didn't want to deal with the hassle of having his modem upgraded and explained he was considering cancelling his service, but when I explained it was free to upgrade and it would only take a few minutes to set up, he agreed. He called back the next day to thank me and tell me how happy he was with his upgraded internet service.\"\n\nWhat tactics do you use to encourage customers to purchase additional products or services?\n\nAs a call centre representative, your employer may ask you to offer new or existing products and services to callers. Hiring managers may ask this question to determine whether you have previous sales experience and if you can help them meet their revenue goals.\n\nExample:\"I listen carefully to each customer to identify any unmet needs they may have so I can recommend additional products, services, or features they may benefit from. For example, if a customer is interested in using your accounting software to track expenses and send out invoices, I might recommend that they add on the mileage and time tracking features so they can accurately reimburse staff members and manage everyone's work schedule remotely.By explaining the benefits of having these features built into the same application, the customer can visualize how upgrading their account with us could improve their business.\"\n\nHow do you define quality customer service?\n\nAsking this question can help hiring managers assess your customer service experience and whether your values align with the company's values. Use your answer to showcase how you treat customers with respect and put their needs first. You may also share how you prefer to be treated as a customer.\n\nExample:\"I believe quality customer service requires patience, empathy, and respect. When a customer calls me to discuss an issue, I try to consider how I might feel if I were experiencing a similar challenge. I know I would want to be listened to and feel like the company would make things right. I strive to make sure callers have a positive overall experience by assuring them I'm here to help and working with them to solve their issues.\"", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "a1318184-5754-4249-b005-2ef2bb552fa2", "url": "https://ca.indeed.com/career-advice/interviewing/call-center-interview-questions"}

{"text": "What do painted lady caterpillars eat?\n\nFood sources for painted lady caterpillars include various species of thistle, hollyhock, mallow, and Verbascum. In the wild, these larvae would never encounter all of these species of plants, but in agricultural settings, they may be present on the same farm.\n\nThe caterpillars of the painted lady butterfly chiefly feed on various species of thistle.\n\nHow do you take care of Painted Lady caterpillars?\n\nIt is important to keep the lid on the cup throughout the larval stage. This is because the larvae need to be protected from dehydration and predators. The holes punched in the lid allow for air circulation while still keeping the larvae safe.\n\nThe larvae of the painted lady butterfly feed on the leaves of a wide variety of host plants. More than 100 species have been recorded, but they primarily feed on plants in the Compositae, Boraginaceae, and Malvaceae families. Some of their preferred foods include calendula, hollyhock, mallow, sunflower, and thistles (including Canada thistle).\n\nWhat is the host plant for the Painted Lady butterfly\n\nThe main larval host plant for Vanessa cardui (Painted Lady) butterflies are thistles and plants in the Family Malvaceae (Mallow Family). They prefer nectar from flowers of plants in the Family Asteraceae (Aster Family) that are 3-6 feet high.\n\nPainted lady butterflies have a strong preference for purple flowers, and will visit these flowers 45% of the time. They are much less likely to visit red (24%), yellow (22%), or white (9%) flowers.\n\nCan you touch a Painted Lady caterpillar?\n\nMost caterpillars are perfectly safe to handle. Painted lady and swallowtail caterpillars are common examples. Even the monarch butterfly caterpillar, though toxic if eaten, does nothing more than tickle you when held.\n\nEggs: Mint green, barrel-shaped eggs are laid singly on the leaves of host plants, and hatch in 3-5 days.\n\nLarvae: The caterpillar has five instars over 12-18 days.\n\nPupae: The chrysalis stage lasts about 10 days.\n\nAdults: Once the butterfly emerges from the chrysalis, it will mate and lay eggs to continue the cycle.\n\nCan painted lady caterpillars eat bananas?\n\nA cup of sugar mixed with two teaspoons of water can make a sugar-water solution that can help sustain butterflies. Adding a small sponge to the dish can help the butterflies access the sugar water and also provides them with a place to rest.\n\nFruit, including oranges and bananas, can also be put out for butterflies to eat. By mashing the bananas, it makes it easier for them to feed.\n\nButterflies are particularly fond of rotten fruit, such as oranges, grapefruit, strawberries, peaches, nectarines, apples, and bananas. This makes sense, as they are attracted to sweet smells. A couple of Painted Lady (Vanessa cardui) butterflies enjoy sips of sweet fruit juice on a summer afternoon.\n\nDo caterpillars need water\n\ncaterpillars don't typically need extra water, as they get all they need from the plants they eat. However, many caterpillars will wander around a bit before they pupate – so if you see one on the move, it's likely searching for a good spot to transform.\n\nA butterfly's wings are very important to their survival! By vibrating their wings, they are able to increase their metabolic rate and stay warm. This allows them to fly away quickly if they need to.\n\nDo painted lady butterflies drink water?\n\nButterflies need water to survive, but they can't drink out of puddles, ponds or a birdbath because there's no place for them to rest. Place shallow pans of water near the plants or put a sponge in a birdbath that reaches the surface of the water. Lay fresh slices of oranges in a shallow pan of sugar water to attract butterflies.\n\nThis is a great way to observe a caterpillar as it grows and changes into a butterfly. Be sure to use fresh leaves and change them every day, and also provide dry paper towels to help prevent mold. Enjoy watching your caterpillar grow and change!\n\nDoes a painted lady chrysalis need to hang\n\nChrysalids are the larval stage of butterflies and moths. The adult butterfly or moth emerges from the chrysalis, which is typically attached to a plant. In order to ensure that the adult butterfly or moth is able to spread its wings and fly correctly, the chrysalis should be placed near the wall of the cage so that the adult can climb up andspread its wings. If the adult butterfly or moth is not able to spread its wings before they harden, the wings will be deformed and the butterfly or moth will not be able to fly.\n\nPainted lady butterflies are known to snack on fresh fruit, such as oranges, in addition to finding their delicious nectar in all sorts of sunflowers and flowering host plants like hollyhock, coneflowers and daisies.\n\nCan painted lady butterflies eat lemons?\n\nYes! Butterflies will eat lemons. Butterflies love nectar from flowers, and lemons provide a great source of nectar for them. In addition to nectar, butterflies also love to eat fruit, and lemons are a great source of fruit for them as well.\n\nIf you come into contact with a caterpillar, it is best to avoid touching it with your bare hands. The small hairs on their skin can cause a sting or irritation. Some caterpillars also release fluids that can be poisonous if they come into contact with your skin. If you must handle a caterpillar, it is best to wear gloves or use a tool to avoid direct contact.\n\nHow long does it take for painted lady caterpillars to turn into butterflies\n\nTransformations from larvae to butterfly can vary and an average is 4 weeks. Housing each larva in its own container with lid helps to ensure the transformation process.\n\nThe abdomen is one of the best ways to tell the difference between a male and female cricket. The female has a larger and rounder abdomen, while the male has a straighter looking abdomen. This difference is most easily seen when looking at the cricket from above.\n\nWhy are my Painted Lady caterpillars not moving\n\nIf you find caterpillars in your garden, don't worry! They are perfectly safe and are actually quite easy to care for. All you need is a sturdy container with a lid, some fresh leaves, and a little bit of patience.\n\nThe caterpillars will probably not move much on the first day or so after you've found them. This is perfectly normal. As they start eating and growing, you may see small balls of waste on the bottom of the container. This is called \"frass\" and is perfectly normal.\n\nWith a little bit of care, your caterpillars will transform into beautiful butterflies in no time!\n\nA caterpillar liquifies and reforms into a butterfly through metamorphosis. On day 10, the chrysalis' turn black as the butterfly prepares to emerge.\n\nWhere do Painted Lady butterflies sleep at night\n\nButterflies don't actually sleep. Instead they rest, or become quiescent, at night or during the day when it's cloudy or cool. They rest with eyes open, typically hidden amid the foliage and hanging upside down from leaves or twigs in trees and shrubs.\n\nFirst, the caterpillar digests itself, releasing enzymes to dissolve all of its tissues. If you were to cut open a cocoon or chrysalis at just the right time, caterpillar soup would ooze out.\n\nCan painted lady butterflies eat honey\n\nIf you are interested in attracting butterflies to your indoor space, it is important to provide them with a nectar source. Because it can be difficult to keep a plant full of nectar-producing flowers blooming indoors, most people opt to use an alternate food source. There are many types of food that will feed butterflies well, including fruit juice, 15% honey water, 15% sugar water, and Gatorade. By providing one of these options, you can create a welcoming environment for these beautiful creatures.\n\nCaterpillars do sleep, but their sleep patterns are different from ours. They tend to take brief naps, usually lasting from 10 minutes to a few hours. This allows them to conserve energy and rest between periods of activity.\n\nWhat is the best thing to feed butterflies\n\nBy providing sliced overripe fruit like oranges, bananas, berries, pineapple, melon, pears and plums, you will make it easier for the bird to feed. Katy recommends mashed banana as it is easy to eat and also nutritious. You can also try mixing banana with a little bit of water to form a paste – this will make it even easier for the bird to feed using its proboscis.\n\nWater is essential for a butterfly and it is important to provide water in various ways including ponds, fountains, misters, or birdbaths. By doing so, butterflies will have a clean and safe place to drink and can help to promote their populations.\n\nWhat food can I put out for butterflies\n\nThanks for sharing about Butterflies will eat a variety of fruit. I like to feed them bananas, apples, and pears. I will poke each piece of fruit many times to make it nice and juicy and give space for butterflies to stick their proboscises. Butterflies do not always eat for their own nourishment.\n\nCaterpillars can be a major problem for farmers as they can strip an entire plant in a very short amount of time. They will typically attack the crown of the plant first, which can rapidly kill the lettuce plant. In addition, caterpillars can also feast on young seedlings, which can destroy an entire crop.\n\nDo caterpillars like to be held\n\nIf you come across a caterpillar, it is best to avoid picking it up. Caterpillars are small and delicate insects, and can easily be injured if handled carelessly.\n\nA caterpillar's job is just to eat and eat and eat, so the most important part of caring for a caterpillar is to provide a constant supply of fresh food. The first thing to do is provide the caterpillar with some leaves from the plant or tree on which you found it, as there is a good chance that this is its host plant. If you are not sure what the host plant is, you can try giving the caterpillar a variety of leaves to see what it eats. Once you have found a food source that the caterpillar likes, make sure to keep the supply fresh. You can do this by picking new leaves every day or two and storing them in a container with a little bit of water.\n\nDo birds eat painted lady butterflies\n\nPainted Lady Butterflies have many predators–wasps, mantises, birds, and other animals may eat the butterflies, eggs, larvae, or pupae. The adult Painted Lady Butterfly only lives about two weeks!\n\nThe Painted Lady Butterfly is the most widespread butterfly species found on the planet, occupying all continents except Antarctica and Australia!\n\nConclusion\n\nPainted lady caterpillars eat a variety of plants, including hollyhocks, sunflowers, and alfalfa.\n\nPainted lady caterpillars will consume a variety of different plants during their lifetime including but not limited to clover, yarrow, and violets. By doing so, they help to keep these plants healthy and free from diseases. In return, the plants provide the caterpillars with the nutrients they need to grow and transform into beautiful butterflies", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "47ec0419-d5cb-479e-8f76-f591e7c84100", "url": "https://talkpainting.com/what-do-painted-lady-caterpillars-eat/"}

{"text": "Taping Your Knee for Stability vs. Pain -What's the Difference?\n\nOver a lifetime, our knees really take a beating. And for those who regularly take part in running or other high-impact exercises, knee problems can be tough to escape.\n\nOne helpful method for these fit folks? Knee taping. While taping your knee won't magically cure all its issues, it can help with pain, stability, function and swelling when done correctly.\n\nDaniel Casey, MD, a primary care sports medicine specialist at Banner Health Center in Surprise, AZ, explained the best reasons to tape, the difference between taping for stability versus for pain, and the most common mistakes people make when taping.\n\nWhy tape your knee?\n\nWhile knee taping may seem like a fairly new practice, Dr. Casey noted that it's actually been in medical literature since the 1960s. Knee taping falls into two main categories: pain reduction and increased stability. According to Dr. Casey, these are some common reasons someone might tape their knee:\n\nIn cases of injury, knee taping can help athletes reduce pain and continue to exercise while their injury heals. It's important to remember that knee tape isn't a \"Get Out of Jail Free\" card. Rest can be necessary for many knee injuries to properly heal. Rather than push through the pain, you should make a plan for recovery with your physician.\n\nTaping for pain\n\nFor pain reduction, the two main knee taping methods are Mulligan taping and Kinesio taping.\n\nIn Mulligan taping, the person applying tape will apply force to the joint that's in pain. This helps the joint move less painfully. A rigid tape is then placed in line with your joint to help it move pain-free once the person stops applying force to your joint.\n\nKinesio taping uses a stretchy elastic adhesive that was developed in Japan. This tape lifts the skin to increase the space between blood vessels and cells. This decreases pain, improves soft tissue drainage, and helps tissue move more smoothly over the muscles.\n\nTaping for stability\n\nFor increased stability, the two main methods are rigid taping and McConnell taping. Rigid taping, Dr. Casey said, is probably the most common and recognizable method here.\n\nRigid taping uses tape that is more rigid to hold the joint in place. In this method, an under wrap (also called pre-wrap) is used between tape and skin to prevent irritation. Rigid taping can help the joint sense and respond to movement while limiting excess joint motion.\n\nMcConnell taping is meant primarily for patella (kneecap) stability. Dr. Casey said folks with patellofemoral syndrome, aka \"runner's knee,\" should consider this method, as it provides helpful pressure in one specific direction and feedback to the patella during movement.\n\nFor all of these different types of taping, there are numerous ways the tape can be configured, depending on the specific knee issues and types of exercise being performed. In all instances, consult a licensed sports medicine specialist to learn the proper method for your needs.\n\nCommon taping mistakes\n\nAccording to Dr. Casey, people often make the following mistakes when taping their knee:\n\nUsing lotions or creams on the skin before applying tape: Makes it harder for the tape to stay in place.\n\nApplying rigid medical tape directly to the skin: Rigid tape can be quite painful to remove from the skin. Don't forget that under wrap/pre-wrap!\n\nTaping too tightly: You might do this to get \"more bang for your buck,\" but it can cause overly limited motion, skin rash or shearing (when your skin is pulled in the opposite direction as the underlying tissue or bone causing soft-tissue or blood vessel damage).\n\nTaping the back of the knee: This area has a lot of excess motion, which can keep the tape from working properly. It can also irritate the skin by trapping moisture.\n\nWhen removing tape that's directly on your skin, do it slowly. You'll also want to unroll the tape from the skin — don't pull/tug/yank it off. There are ways to loosen the adhesive, like soaking the tape with a wet washcloth for 10-15 minutes before removing it. Rubbing alcohol and baby oil can also be effective.\n\nWhatever your knee issues, consulting with a medical professional is a good first step. They may suggest knee taping or other treatments tailored to your specific needs. After all, knee problems can run the gamut (pun intended). If you're experiencing knee problems, contact your health care provider or find a doctor at bannerhealth.com.\n\nIn the end, finding proper care and exercising carefully so not to worsen injury is important.

{"text": "How does a chiropractor know where to adjust?\n\nTodd Lloyd\n\nJune 20, 2022 adjustment. But, how do they now where that segment is?\n\nAn overview the spine and how things go wrong.\n\nYour spine has 24 moving segments from the top of your head to your tailbone. Your neck has 7 segments, your middle back with the ribs has 12 segments and 12 pairs of ribs, and your lumbar spine has 5 segments.\n\nYour spine needs to be mobile, but at the same time, it needs to brace and support all f your movements. And most importantly, your spine protects the core of your nervous system, wrapping around your spinal cord. Things can get injured.\n\nWhiplash injuries can bruise the supportive soft tissues in your neck and low back. Lifting injuries can tear and herniate the discs in your low back. Woking at your desk can cause the muscles in your upper back to brace, tighten, and hurt.\n\nAfter an injury, the parts of your spine may not move so well. And treating these parts is the job of your chiropractor.\n\nLow back pain is the number one cause of disability in working adjusts. Neck pain is the number 4 cause of disability. It affects your quality of life.\n\nThe key to great chiropractic care is getting movement back into the spine. And good movement involves mobility and strength.\n\nBut there are reflexes involved too. Injuries to the discs or facet joints in your spine will rigger a neurological reflex from the injured tissue to the surface of the skin. At the surface of the skin, these nerve reflexes will cause the blood vessels at the surface to dilate, and this makes your skin red and slightly puffy.\n\nScanning your spine for surface skin changes\n\nChiropractor will touch your skin to see where they need to adjust you. Those pain reflexes from the joints in your spine to the surface of the skin will cause the area to become red and boggy. The you have irritation to your upper back, it's easy to see where parts next to the spine get red after being touched. You can also run your finger down the trough of your spine to find some skin that has lost its tight, smooth consistency. This usually indicates some failure in the movement and health of your spine.\n\nFeeling the consistency of the skin on the spine is chiropractic 101, and it even applies to olde timey Osteopaths who do spinal manipulation. Look for alterations in the surface of the skin. It tells you something.\n\nAnd this also points to the intimacy of the reflexes involving the spine with the autonomic nervous system, and all that can be changed with a little spinal irritation.\n\nFeeling for heat at the surface of the skin\n\nAt the same time, changes in the surface of your skin through reflexes can make surfaces of your skin have hot spots. Chiropractors use to use thermography to graph the skin on the spine looking for alterations of heat. I use to have a device that I held in my hand, where I would run it up and down your back looking for temperature differences from one side to the other. It got stolen when someone broke into my car while in chiropractic college, and I never replaced it.\n\nFeeling changes in normal muscle tone around your spine\n\nWhen you are injured, your muscles will either tighten to brace the injured area, or they will go flaccid to protect too much tension on the area.\n\nYour chiropractor will feel for tightness in the muscles surrounding your spine to see where he needs to adjust you. Sometimes muscles will be very restricted. Other times, muscles will only be very mildly tight, and in certain directions. The small muscles in your spine might be trying to pull the segment of the spine in the right direction when there's a misalignment, and this can be a very nuanced thing to palpate.\n\nYou can often feel in the base of your skull where the muscles are tight and they are trying to pull it all back. These suboccipital muscles are pretty easy to feel.\n\nFeeling of restricted motion\n\nA big part of a routine chiropractic visit is that feeling or restricted motion. Chiropractors use motion palpation, a technique to identify what segments of your spine is moving well and what segments are not. I like to feel how the ribs do or don't move when I do my famous upper back rib adjustment. When a patient is in her side-lying position for a lumbar adjustment, I'll check the movement of each segment to identify what part doesn't move.\n\nFeeling for painful areas on your spine\n\nAnd when a segment doesn't move well, it's going to be a little painful. Sometimes a lot painful.\n\nLoss of movement causes metabolic wastes to build up. These painful enzymes and acids in the soft tissue will cause the lining of the bone to be sensitive. One segment in your mid back might feel fine when someone touches you, but the next one could light you up in pain.\n\nAnd these tender segments have all of the other signs. They'll be tight. They'll be tender. They'll have braced muscles. And if you felt the temperature with a thermography machine, you might see some temperature differences.\n\nWhat about all of these computerized tests?\n\nI love technology. As a matter of fact, I use the Kinetisense system for evaluating movement patterns in my athletes and injured patients. it measures symmetry, mobility, strength, and posture. At the end of a KAMS evaluation, it will give you a score that you can use to measure your improvement. It will tell you where certain parts are stuck and what parts need to be strengthened.\n\nSome chiropractors have bought into systems of technology that will measure heat or muscle tone. This is cool technology that measures a nice before and after patient care when you are managing cases.\n\nSome chiropractors also rely heavily on x-ray technology, which was pioneered and developed by chiropractors early in the invention of x-ray technology 100+ years ago.\n\nHowever, all of this technology is no substitute for the visit by visit assessment of a patient when he comes in for routine care. You would never want to do a computerized spinal assessment of a patient on every visit, and you certainly wouldn't x-ray on every visit.\n\nFeeling for changes after the adjustment\n\nPalpation is king. Feeling for those movement and reflexive characteristics of your spine is what an experienced chiropractor can do before, during, and after an adjustment. I can feel a stuck segment before I adjust it, and I can also feel how much it improves afterward.\n\nSometimes the difference is night and day. Sometimes the changes are a little more subtle. But the biggest change of all is one that I didn't mention: It feels great to have an adjustment. No better feeling in a doctor's office than to have that pressure taken off your spine.", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "6bdb2a25-f164-4c40-9c39-163067e62989", "url": "https://adjust.clinic/independent-study/how-does-a-chiropractor-know-where-to-adjust/"}

{"text": "Keith Mitchell Golf Girlfriend\n\nGolf can be a challenge especially for those who are new to the sport. But worry not, we've got you covered! We've gathered up some of the top golf experts to give you the best tips to boost your game. Whether you're struggling in your golf swing or posture, or just beginning We've got the tips to guide you.\n\nBe focused on your the path to success\n\nIf you're slicing your shots, it's probably because your clubface isn't closing fast enough through impact. To fix this attempt to separate your hands from the grip. Hold the club in its usual position with one hand and move the other hand to where the grip meets the shaft. This will make it easier to square the face of the club at impact and keep the handle pointed towards the stomach button. Be sure to scrub the grass with a lot of force as you practice this.\n\nStand tall and proud\n\nYour posture is vital to your success in the course. Place your hands on the club and press them against your thighs, then bend forward from your hips while stretching your knees. Make sure your back is straight, so that your arms are naturally hanging down. After that, hold the club using your gloved hands and verify whether it's at a 45-degree angle to your forearm. Voila you're in the perfect position!\n\nAim true\n\nMisaligned clubface at address could result in shots going awry. To avoid this, place an alignment stick just outside the golf ball, so that it forms a 90-degree angle to the target line. Once you have set it up, align with the top edge the club with the stick, then bring it back to its regular location. This is an easy method to make sure the clubface is straight each time.\n\nPractice makes perfect\n\nIf you're stuck inside and want to get better at putting ability, get your putter in hand and make use of the baseboards to assess your path. Place your putter on a baseboard and begin your stroke. If you strike the board, something is wrong with your stroke. It is important to not hit the board with straight or arcing stroke.\n\nWiden your horizons\n\nThe speed starts at the beginning in your swing. To increase the speed of your ball make sure you create width in your takeaway. Try taking the club back to the farthest distance you can, creating maximum width. This will naturally make your body rotate with you and generate more speed when you lower yourself from the top.\n\nFocus on distance and accuracy\n\nDistance is crucial however, accuracy is more crucial. In order to be proficient in both, you must extend your arms to the fullest extent possible during the impact. Make a tee and put another tee about six inches from the first at an angle of 45 degrees. Your goal is to strike the ball on the first tee and swing your clubhead on the second. This will help you increase energy and speed in your swing.\n\nDon't forget to stretch!\n\nGolf is a physical activity, which is why it's essential to stretch before you play. Take a few minutes to warm up your muscles and prepare for your round. Focus on stretching your shoulders, back and legs as well as your arms to improve the flexibility of your body and increase range. This will help you increase the power in your swing and lower the chance of injury.\n\nKeep your head down\n\nKeep your head low crucial to maintaining good form throughout your swing. When you're taking your swing, focus on keeping your head down and your eyes fixed on the ball. This will help you to keep your balance and control throughout your swing.\n\nKeep your eyes on the finish\n\nThe finish of your swing is just as important as your beginning. As you swing through the ball, you should focus on finishing with a high level and maintaining balance. This will allow you generate more speed and power during your swing. Additionally, it will also assist you to avoid falling back or out of balance towards the final swing.\n\nParticipate in different clubs\n\nGolf clubs are available in various shapes and sizes, each with their unique qualities and flaws. Try various clubs to discover the one that's right for you. It's important to try out different kinds of clubs such as irons, woods, wedges, and putters in order to discover the one you enjoy most. The experience of playing with various clubs will let you know the strengths and weaknesses of each one and how they can be used to achieve different shots.\n\nKeep your eyes on the target\n\nHaving a clear target in mind is crucial in golf. Before each shot it is important to pinpoint your goal and imagine the shot you'd like create. This will allow you focus your attention and increase your chances that you hit your ball where you'd like it to be. Be sure to keep your eyes on the target throughout the entire swing and aim to strike the ball cleanly. Remember, your target doesn't always need been the hole; it could be a spot on the fairway or in a particular area or area of green.\n\nPlay with a pro or take a lesson\n\nLearning from a pro or taking a lesson is a great way to improve your game. A professional golfer or coach can give you personalised feedback and help you identify areas of your game that need improvement. They can also give you tips and drills that can assist you in working on particular areas of your game. Even players with experience will benefit from lessons as they can help fine-tune your gameand assist to keep the method and strategy sharp.\n\nEnjoy yourself!\n\nMost importantly, remember to enjoy yourself! Golf is a demanding and rewarding sport, however it's important to enjoy yourself and not get too obsessed with trying to master every shot. Take your time, focus on your technique, and enjoy the experience of playing golf. If you practice and put in the time, you'll see your skills increase, and you'll be on the road to becoming a professional golfer!", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "159312c1-bf42-49d9-9e66-70b559eeab6d", "url": "https://onefromme.com/keith-mitchell-golf-girlfriend/"}
{"text": "Fish, undammed\n\nIngenious tube systems could reconnect ailing fish populations.\n\nAs human culture and ingenuity has progressed, the construction of instream barriers such as dams and weirs has grown as a significant threat to freshwater fish species worldwide.\n\nThere are more than 2 million dams and other stream barriers in the US alone.\n\nNow, a team of researchers from the University of New South Wales (UNSW) has found a way to get fish around – or rather over – barriers, reconnecting them with breeding grounds and preferred habitats.\n\nThey've developed a \"fishway\" that utilises the acceleration of flows in a tube system to pump the fish – protected by a cushion of water – vertically through a tube up and over an obstruction, thus delivering them safely into the water on the other side.\n\n\"A challenge that we are just commencing to address is getting the fish downstream in the river,\" explains Bill Peirson from the Water Research Laboratory at UNSW.\n\n\"This is not important for small structures – they just swim with the flow. However, for high structures they can be killed by impacts in the overflow and we need to find gentler ways for them to descend large dams.\"\n\nThe team reported their research in the Journal of Ecohydraulics in 2019, before trialling their prototype at the end of 2020 in two large tanks on a slope at the university campus. Two tubes connected the tanks, pumping water to and fro.\n\nA small Australian bass (Percalates novemaculeata) was coaxed into the tube chamber in the bottom tank, then propelled at high speed through a Perspex tube into the second tank, which sat further up the slope, eight metres higher in elevation.\n\nThe method of transporting fish through tubes isn't new. The prototype adds to previous engineering feats in the US, which see fish being carried over dams by a waterless chute.\n\nThe team found that with aerated water in the tube, the fish have a layer of bubbles that provides them with oxygen and cushions them against any pressure variations as they travel through.\n\nGet an update of science stories delivered straight to your inbox.\n\nGet a daily dose of science\n\nGet a weekly Cosmos Catch-up\n\nImportantly, no fish were injured during the trials and all piscine study subjects remained healthy after a monitoring period of 14 days.\n\nSnapshot: freshwater fishes in decline\n\nFreshwater fishes are among the most threatened vertebrate taxa in the world\n\nThe IUCN reports that global freshwater fish populations declined by an average of 83% between 1970 and 2014\n\nWater extraction for human use and associated infrastructure such as dams and weirs are a primary cause\n\nIn Australia alone, development in the Murray Darling Basin has led to the construction of more than 10,000 barriers, restricting fish species' access to breeding grounds and preferred habitats.\n\n\"Freshwater fish populations have declined by more than 80% over the last four decades across the globe,\" explains Richard Kingsford from the Centre for Ecosystem Science at UNSW.\n\n\"This is partly due to the hundreds of thousands of our dams, weirs and barriers stopping their movements. If we could reconnect our rivers and give fish the ability to navigate our rivers safely, we would see more breeding and healthier native fish populations.\"\n\nHowever, Peirson says there's no reason we can't have both dams and healthy river systems.\n\n\"Dams are important for maintaining our water supplies during droughts, but they greatly disrupt our river systems,\" he says.\n\n\"There is now a real prospect that we can allow fish to migrate as they should and significantly restore our river ecosystems.\"\n\nFollowing a successful demonstration of the prototype, the research team is now in talks with the City of Paramatta Council in Sydney, with the aim of installing a tube fishway at the Marsden St Weir, on the Parramatta River", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "09043b46-251f-46af-836d-02b3b010464e", "url": "https://cosmosmagazine.com/nature/fish-undammed/"}

{"text": "OpenAI releases GPT4, its latest after ChatGPT sensation\n\nAfter the ChatGPT earthquake , OpenAI has just launched GPT4, its next-generation language model. Its capabilities surp those of the previous model, promises the San Francisco-based company. ChatGPT, published at the end of November, caused a sensation with its ability to interact naturally with humans.\n\nBy opening ChatGPT to the public, the start-up benefited from valuable feedback, which helped it design the new model. Open AI ensures in particular that the new chatbot is less likely to be manipulated by users seeking to make it spit out dangerous information, such as the recipe for making a Molotov tail for example.\n\n\"According to our internal evaluations, GPT4 responses are 40% less likely to contain factual errors than those of GPT3.5\", the model on which ChatGPT was based, ures the Californian company. The large language models – including those of OpenAI, but also of Google or of Facebook – tend to invent facts when they do not know the answer to a question. GPT4 has yet to prove itself in this regard.\n\nCooking recipes and conversation\n\nWill the new chatbot appeal to a wider audience? In a press release, the company headed by Sam Altman gives examples of possible applications: finding a common niche to organize a meeting, using an image to find cooking recipe ideas (pancakes, waffles, omelets or cakes), or compose a paragraph telling the story of Cinderella with a writing constraint: each word in the story must begin with a letter of the alphabet, in order.\n\nOn this occasion, OpenAI also unveils several partnerships with companies using its technology to build their own applications. For example, the Duolingo app uses artificial intelligence to allow someone learning Spanish to conduct conversations in that language.", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "0d93701d-e991-455c-81e5-12fd227a558d", "url": "https://newsinfrance.com/openai-releases-gpt4-its-latest-after-chatgpt-sensation/"}

{"text": "How to Use OR Operator in Bash Scripting?\n\nIn the Bash script, there are various numbers of logical operators. One of them is the OR (boolean) operator represented by \"||.\" The conditions in the Bash script are checked using the OR operators, which return the result in a \"true\" or \"false.\" The further execution of the tasks is then decided based on these results (true or false).\n\nThis guide will focus on using the OR operator in the Bash script of Linux.\n\nUsage of OR Operator in Bash Script\n\nCheck the User Age Using OR Operator\n\nOR Operator Using Loop\n\nCheck Condition Using \"-o\" Operator\n\nOR Operator in Bash Script\n\nThe syntax for using the OR operator in the bash script, the following syntax is carried out:\n\nSyntax\n\nCondition 1 || condition 2 || Condition 3........Condition n\n\nEnter Condition 1, condition 2, and separate them by OR (||) operator.\n\nThe OR operator returns true when any of the given conditions is true or false when all conditions fail. It is just like the following truth table of OR:\n\nOR Truth Table\n\nCondition 1\n\nCondition 2\n\nResult (Condition || Condition 2)\n\nTrue\n\nTrue\n\nTrue\n\nTrue\n\nFalse\n\nTrue\n\nFalse\n\nTrue\n\nTrue\n\nFalse\n\nFalse\n\nFalse\n\nExample 1: Check the Age of the User Using OR Operator\n\nThe following script will take the age of the user and print the accordingly:\n\nThe \"read\" property is used to take two numbers (Stating and Ending) in the variable \"start\" and \"end.\"\n\nThe \"while\" loop with the two conditions separated by OR (||) operator to check if the starting number is less than or equal to the ending.\n\nThe \"do\" portion prints the starting number stored in the \"$start\" variable.\n\nThe \"((start=start+1))\" increments in the \"$start\" variable to continue the loop.\n\nSave the above script and exit.\n\nExecute the script file \"script.sh\" in the terminal:\n\n$ bash script.sh\n\nThe entered starting number is 6 and the ending number is 10. So the generated numbers are 6,7,8,9,10.\n\nExample 3: Check Condition Using \"o\" Operator\n\nThe user can also use the \"o\" operator instead of a double pipe (||) which is also known as the OR operator in bash. Let's use it in the below script where a number will be taken from the user and check that the number is even or divisible by 3:\n\nThe \"read\" property takes the number from the user in the \"num\" variable by displaying the message.\n\nThe \"if\" conditions are separated by the \"-o\" operator that checks if the entered number is even or divisible by 3.\n\nThe \"then\" portion executes the \"echo\" command if any of the specified conditions are true.\n\nThe \"else\" portion executes the \"echo\" command if both conditions fail.\n\nSave the above script and exit.\n\nRun the script using the bash command:\n\n$ bash script.sh\n\nThe output is described as\n\nFirst, the entered number was 5, and the message is printed that the number is not even nor divisible by 3.\n\nSecondly, the entered number 2, and the message is printed that the number is even or divisible by 3.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn the Bash script, the OR (||) is the logical operator examined for checking the conditions. It returns the results as \"true\" or \"false\". The \"true\" status is returned when any given conditions are true and \"false\" when all conditions fail. The user can use OR (||) operator in the script or in a loop based on the requirement.

{"text": "Smart locks are a popular and innovative addition to home security systems. These locks allow homeowners to access their homes with a code, a key card, or even their smartphone, making it easy and convenient to enter and exit the home. But smart locks offer more than just convenience. They also provide a number of security benefits that traditional locks do not.\n\nOne of the primary benefits of smart locks is the ability to grant access to your home remotely. With a traditional lock, you have to physically give someone a key or hide one under a rock in the front yard. With a smart lock, you can grant access to your home remotely, using an app on your smartphone. This is especially useful if you need to let someone in while you're away from home or if you want to give a cleaner or contractor access to your home without having to be there yourself.\n\nAnother benefit of smart locks is the ability to track who has accessed your home. Many smart locks have activity logs that show when someone has entered or exited the home and who they are. This can be helpful for keeping track of who has been in your home and when, which can be useful for investigating a break-in or for keeping track of children or elderly family members.\n\nSmart locks also offer improved security compared to traditional locks. Many smart locks are designed to resist picking and bumping, which are two common methods used by burglars to break into homes. Additionally, many smart locks include additional security features, such as encryption and biometric authentication, which make it even more difficult for intruders to gain access to your home.\n\nSmart locks also offer a number of benefits for people who are always on the go. If you often lose your keys or forget to lock your doors, a smart lock can help you out. Many smart locks can be locked or unlocked using a smartphone app, so you can check whether or not your doors are locked from anywhere and lock them remotely if needed. Additionally, many smart locks include automatic locking, which means that your door will lock automatically after you've closed it. This is a convenient feature for people who may forget to lock the door before leaving their home.\n\nMoreover, Smart Locks also offers benefits for renters and home owners who always have guests over. Smart locks allows the ability to have a unique and temporary code for guests , so they can access the house when they need to, without giving out a physical key or giving guests the ability to come in whenever they want. This feature also means that you don't have to worry about getting your keys back after guests leave, or changing the locks if you lose your keys.\n\nSmart locks are also energy efficient and they are a more sustainable option than traditional locks. Smart locks are battery operated and they use very little power. They also don't require any additional wiring, which means that they're easy to install and don't require any additional power sources.\n\nIn conclusion, Smart locks offer a convenient and secure solution for homeowners. They offer remote access, activity logging, improved security, automatic locking, and energy efficiency. Additionally, for renters or homeowners with frequent guests, Smart locks also offers temporary code option for guests to access the house which eliminates the hassle of physical keys and lock changes. These features provide peace of mind and make everyday life a little more convenient. They're definitely worth considering if you're looking to upgrade your home security system.", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "bfd388b7-3bc0-4ea8-a91d-3d0d7ada77b7", "url": "https://txhsfbgameday.com/the-benefits-of-smart-locks-for-home-security/"}

To boost the event's impact, Budayr and Wenjen teamed up with the three groups who screen children's reading material — librarians, teachers and parents. As one of the three Platinum Sponsors of Multicultural Children's Book Day 2016, I participated on behalf of my company, Story Quest Books, in all activities leading up to and including the big day — January 27. Here's a summary of third annual event's impact:\n\nMulticultural Children's Book Day 2016\n\n— Librarians. A new partnership with the Junior Library Guild helped highlight the best current diverse books published. Over 185 librarian bloggers reviewed books and shared their insights and recommendations on social media.\n\n— Teachers. A new collaboration with schools and teachers put 1,000 free diverse books in classrooms and libraries. Participating teachers also received an extensive resource of more than 200 book lists covering diversity.\n\n— Parents. Over 200 book bloggers wrote book reviews and shared their unique perspectives on websites and other social media to reach parents.\n\nIn addition, a huge Diversity Book Giveaway took place during the #ReadYourWorld Twitter Party from 9-10pm EST on 1/27/16.\n\nStory Quest Books reports that the 2016 event resulted in 96 MILLION social media shares — an increase of 30 percent from 2015.\n\n\"Getting books into the hands of children is our ultimate mission,\" according to Budayr and Wenjen. With very little money raised, they gave more than 1,000 books away during the event. Even after the event ends, they ship free multicultural books to schools and organizations.\n\nWhy is this important? Less than 1 in 10 children's books published in the U.S. includes multicultural children. The goal of bringing more diverse books to parents, teachers, librarians and young readers is a worthy one.

{"text": "Can Dogs Eat Pizza Crust\n\nEver wondered if it's cool to split your pizza with your dog, Fido? I mean, how can you say no to those adorable puppy eyes wanting a piece of the pie?\n\nThough we're all about treating our fuzzy buddies, we've gotta know what's cool for them to eat and what's a total no-go. In this piece, I'm gonna check out whether dogs can actually munch on pizza crust without any fuss.\n\nPizza's like one of those things everyone loves in the U.S., and it's found its way into kitchens all over the globe. But even though we dig cheesy slices loaded with our top toppings, is it a good idea for our four-legged pals to have some too?\n\nHere's everything you gotta know about letting your dog have some pizza crust – and whether or not it's best to keep them away from this popular snack!\n\nWhat's in Pizza Crust Anyway?\n\nI bet we all dig the crunchy feel and yummy taste of pizza crust. But what's really in that stuff?\n\nLet's take a closer look at what's in this favorite munchie that might make us wonder if our pets can actually have a bite.\n\nPizza crust is mostly made up of carbs like wheat flour, which gives your dog energy and helps them digest stuff. A regular two-ounce serving has about twenty grams of carbs and one hundred thirty calories. That's a lot of carbs compared to stuff like protein or fat, so you'll want to think about that before giving your pooch a piece.\n\nAlso, lots of store-bought pizza dough has things like sugar, salt, spices, oil, and stuff to make it rise, so you're gonna want to skip those – homemade's usually the way to go!\n\nAll in all, while pizza crust has some good stuff like carbs and calories for dogs, the extra ingredients could be a problem, depending on what your dog can eat.\n\nWhat Could Go Wrong?\n\nIt's super sad to see your furry buddy eyeing your pizza – but not everything we eat is cool for dogs.\n\nPizza crust might look like no big deal, but eating it a lot could cause some real issues.\n\nWhen giving pizza crust to our furry friends, there are a few things that could go wrong, on top of it not being that great for them.\n\nFirst, lots of pizzas have things dogs can be allergic to like dairy and wheat, which might mess with their stomachs or skin.\n\nNext, some pizza toppings have stuff that's poison for pets like garlic and onion powder, so always avoid that when sharing with your dog.\n\nGiving a little pizza crust now and then might not hurt, but too much could mess with their stomach because of the fat – so it's more of a sometimes-snack!\n\nLetting your dog have human food should only happen when you're watching and after talking to a vet about what's safe for your particular pet.\n\nBetter Options than Pizza Crust\n\nYou've probably heard that some stuff we eat can be bad for our furry friends, and pizza crust's one of those things. Even if it looks like no big deal, pizza crust has things that can make dogs real sick.\n\nStuff like onions and garlic, which are often on pizzas, have chemicals that are super bad for dogs. And even the dough can make their bellies hurt or cause other issues.\n\nYou gotta remember not to give them anything with these harmful ingredients. If you think your dog ate something they shouldn't, watch for bad signs like throwing up, diarrhea, not eating, feeling weak or down.\n\nAlso, call your vet right away if anything like this happens after they eat something you're not sure about. When picking out snacks for your dog, go for things made just for them, not human food like pizza crust.\n\nTips for Making Sure Your Doggo's Alright\n\nI totally love giving my pup treats, and I bet you know lots of folks who love to do the same with their furry buddies. Pizza crust might sound like a yummy snack for dogs, but you've got to be careful when you're giving your doggie this munchie.\n\nWhile pizza crust is mostly fine for dogs in little bits, you should never let it take over a big chunk of what they eat. It's a good call to keep an eye on how much you're feeding your dog when it comes to human grub or snacks. Pizza crusts are packed with carbs and fat, and that's not cool for your pet! The cheesy stuff on pizzas can also mess up their tummy if they eat too much of it. Plus, too much salt could make them thirsty and lead to other health hassles later on.\n\nSo while giving them a nibble of pizza crust now and then probably won't hurt, having it all the time might mess with your fuzzy friend's overall well-being. It's always smarter to play it safe with what we feed our pets—even if they give us that \"please-feed-me\" look with those puppy eyes!\n\nMake sure you check in with your vet before adding something new like pizza crust to your dog's menu. That way you'll know you're giving them stuff that's not just tasty but good for them too!\n\nQuestions to Throw at Your Vet\n\nYou might feel like sharing a pizza slice with your pup, but before you dig in, you've got to think about their safety. Before you hand over any people-food like pizza crusts, have a chat with your vet to see if it's cool.\n\nIt's wise to hear from a pro about what human food our doggy pals can have. They'll give you the scoop on how much and how often is just right for your dog's age, breed, size, and how they're feeling health-wise.\n\nWhen you're thinking about what people-food is a safe treat for our pups, keep in mind that some stuff might not agree with their tummies. This includes things like garlic, onion, and tomato sauce that you often find on pizzas. Even the pizza crust might have too much salt or sugar, depending on how it's made.\n\nThe best way to have a pizza party with your pup is to whip up your own using homemade dough and skip all the extra spices or toppings. Then you can break off little bits of the plain crust and toss them a treat, keeping an eye on your pet when it's chow time.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\nCan I Give My Dog A Tiny Bit Of Pizza Crust As A Snack?\n\nI get it, you want to treat your furry buddy sometimes, and pizza crust might seem like a cool idea.\n\nBut, it's not really a good plan for dogs to munch on pizza crust 'cause it's sometimes loaded with fats or stuff like garlic or onions.\n\nLooking to treat your dog with something tasty? There's a ton of other things you can try! Pick snacks made of simple, natural stuff without extra fats or sugars for a better choice.\n\nMight be a good idea to look up what's safe in food before handing over any people food to your doggo.\n\nHomemade or Store-Bought Pizza Crusts: Is There A Difference?\n\nWhen you're thinking about pizza crust, there's more than one way to go. Store-bought ones might have all kinds of flours like plain or whole wheat, and even things like quinoa or almond flour.\n\nIf you're making pizza at home, you can use any flour you fancy, which means you're the boss of what goes into your grub. Whether you're buying it or making it yourself, you get to pick the flour that fits what you like to eat.\n\nHow Often's Cool For My Dog To Have Pizza Crust Without Messing With Their Health?\n\nIf you're handing over pizza crust to your pooch, don't go overboard. Even if your dog's crazy about the taste of pizza dough, keep a lid on how much they get 'cause of what they need to eat.\n\nMake sure that what your dog's eating fits with what they should be having, size-wise and nutrition-wise. To steer clear of health problems from too many carbs or other stuff in pizza crusts, keep it to like once a week – and be on the lookout for any weird reactions!", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "f51618ac-42c8-490f-8c81-5d2d2ab62f51", "url": "https://hickorypizza.com/can-dogs-eat-pizza-crust/"}
{"text": "Sadly, people who are part of the sexual minority often face stigma, discrimination, and other challenges that heterosexual people do not. They also experience higher rates of violence and harassment. All of these factors raise the risk of developing behavioral issues like substance abuse.\n\nWhy is Substance Abuse More Prevalent in the LGBTIA+ Population?\n\nSince the 1970s, scientists have consistently found higher rates of abuse among sexual minorities. There are many reasons why this relationship exists. Let's explore.\n\nSocial stigma. Despite a growing acceptance of sexual minorities in the U.S., the LGBTIA+ population still faces some discrimination. This intolerance can come from family, friends, social media, and people in the community. Hate crimes, bullying, and workplace harassment still take place today.\n\nLack of support. Some people in the LGBTIA+ population choose to \"stay in the closet\" because they want to avoid discrimination and rejection. Unfortunately, living this double life can be lonely and isolating, resulting in substance abuse.\n\nInternalized homophobia. It's possible for members of the LGBTIA+ community to suffer from their own internalized fears. Drinking or using drugs can numb these feelings, but only temporarily.\n\nCo-occurring disorders. Mental health disorders, such as clinical depression and anxiety disorders, are common among the LGBTIA+ population. Some individuals may also suffer from HIV/AIDS, hepatitis, and other sexually transmitted diseases. Understandably, these disorders make it harder to seek professional treatment.\n\nRejection or shame. Rejection is never easy, but it can especially sting when it comes from those people you love the most. Sadly, this is the response that some people get when \"coming out.\"\n\nDrugs of Choice Within the LGBTIA+ Community\n\nMany substances are addictive, though some are more attractive to the LGBTIA+ community. For those who lack family support and are surrounded by other substance abusers, it's easy to follow the same pattern of behavior. Below are the most frequently abused drugs among the LGBTIA+ population.\n\nSexual Minorities Benefit from Specialized Addiction Treatment\n\nSexual minorities are often hesitant to seek treatment from a traditional rehab center, because they are afraid of what others will think or say. Group therapy, sharing rooms, etc. all create opportunities where people can make snarky comments and remarks. Even if someone from the LGBTIA+ community seeks treatment at a traditional rehab facility, they probably won't let down their guard entirely.\n\nGratefully, more rehabs are aware of the need for LGBTIA+ specific addiction treatment, including the Awakenings Treatment Center. We offer mental health and addiction treatment services for this population. We promise to support you no matter how you identify in terms of sexual orientation, gender identity, and gender selection.\n\nHere are some ways our addiction treatment program supports members of the LGBTIA+ community:\n\nPeople do well in our LGBTIA+ program. They're able to work through underlying pain, talk about the topics that are relevant to them, and build a strong support network that includes friends, family, and other community members.

As a result, the average salary in Pakistan can vary greatly depending on the occupation, industry, and location. In this article, we will explore the average wage in Pakistan in more detail, including the factors that influence it and how it compares to other countries.\n\nFactors that Influence Average Salary in Pakistan\n\nSeveral factors can have an impact on the average salary in Pakistan, including:\n\nEducation and qualifications: Higher education levels and specialized training can lead to higher-paying jobs.\n\nExperience: More experienced workers may be able to command higher salaries.\n\nLocation: Salaries can vary depending on where a person works, with urban areas generally paying more than rural areas.Average Salary in Pakistan\n\nCompany size: Larger companies may be able to pay higher salaries than smaller ones.\n\nAverage Salary by Occupation\n\nAccording to data from the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics, the average monthly salary for a worker in Pakistan is around 35,000 PKR (approximately USD 220). However, this varies significantly by occupation. Here are some average salaries for different types of jobs:\n\nDoctor: 160,000 PKR/month (USD 1,000)\n\nEngineer: 80,000-100,000 PKR/month ($500-USD 625)\n\nTeacher: 30,000-50,000 PKR/month ($185-USD 310)\n\nIT Professional: 60,000-80,000 PKR/month ($375-USD 500)\n\nSales Representative: 25,000-30,000 PKR/month ($155-USD 185)\n\nAverage Salary by Industry\n\nAs mentioned earlier, specific industries tend to pay higher salaries than others. Here are some average salaries by industry in Pakistan:\n\nBanking/Finance: 80,000-100,000 PKR/month ($500-USD 625)\n\nInformation Technology: 60,000-80,000 PKR/month ($375-USD 500)\n\nHealthcare: 40,000-60,000 PKR/month ($250-USD 375)\n\nTextiles: 20,000-30,000 PKR/month ($125-USD 185)\n\nHere are the average salaries in Pakistan:\n\n• The average monthly income in Pakistan is approximately PKR 51,651 per month (US$349 at current exchange rates). This includes all jobs from low-income to high-income earners.\n\n• For white-collar jobs, the average salary in Pakistan ranges from PKR 25,000 to PKR 100,000 per month (US$167 – US$667).\n\n• Engineers and IT professionals earn around PKR 50,000 to PKR 150,000 monthly (US$333 – US$1000). These are among the highest-paying jobs in Pakistan.\n\n• The average CEO salary in Pakistan is around PKR 500,000 to PKR 1,000,000 monthly ($3,333-$6,666).\n\nWhat is the salary of the top 1% in Pakistan?\n\nThe salary of the top 1% earners in Pakistan would be considered high income by Pakistani standards. However, limited data are available on the exact salary figures of the top 1% in Pakistan. Some key points regarding the income of the top earners in Pakistan:\n\n• In general, the top 1% earners in Pakistan would include senior managers, business owners, high-level professionals and senior government officials. Their monthly salaries range from several hundred thousand Pakistani rupees to over 1 million.\n\n• The overall wealth of the top 1% in Pakistan is much higher than their salaries due to assets like property, businesses, investments, etc. The wealthiest individuals in Pakistan have a net worth of billions of US dollars.\n\n• Data limitations: Government data on income and salaries in Pakistan does not capture the wages of the top earners well. There is also a lack of surveys specifically studying the payment of the top 1% in Pakistan.\n\n• The average salary of all salary earners in Pakistan is around 40,000-50,000 rupees per month, according to various estimates. So the wages of the top 1% would likely be at least several multiples of that figure.\n\nWhile we cannot pinpoint an exact figure, the salary of the top 1% in Pakistan is estimated to start from several hundred thousand rupees per month and go much higher, reflecting their high-income status in the country.\n\nWhat is the average salary in India vs Pakistan?\n\nIndia: • The average monthly salary in India is around ₹25,000 to ₹30,000 ($330 to $400), though it varies widely depending on the sector, industry and location. • For white-collar jobs in cities like Mumbai, Delhi, and Bangalore, the average salary is around ₹50,000 to ₹1,00,000 ($660 to $1,330) monthly. • Tech salaries in India are generally higher, with average wages of ₹10-20 lakh ($13,300-$26,600) per annum for software developers.\n\nPakistan: • The average monthly salary in Pakistan is around PKR 50,000 to PKR 60,000 ($270 to $320), roughly half the average Indian salary. • Salaries in Pakistan also vary significantly based on industry, occupation and location. White-collar jobs in major cities like Islamabad and Karachi pay more. • Software developers and IT professionals in Pakistan earn average salaries of around PKR 600,000 to PKR 1,000,000 ($3,200-$5,300) per annum.\n\nWhile average salary levels in both countries are relatively low compared to developed economies, average salaries in India tend to be higher than in Pakistan, though the cost of living is also generally higher in India. The gap appears to be around 50-100% when comparing similar occupations between the two countries.\n\nAverage Salary by Location\n\nLocation can also have a significant impact on salary. Here are some average salaries by city in Pakistan:\n\nKarachi: 40,000-60,000 PKR/month ($250-USD 375)\n\nLahore: 35,000-50,000 PKR/month ($220-USD 310)\n\nIslamabad: 50,000-70,000 PKR/month ($310-USD 435)\n\nComparison with Other Countries\n\nCompared to its neighbouring countries, Pakistan has a lower average salary, as reported by the International Labour Organization, with an approximate monthly income of USD 220. This figure is considerably lower than that of India and Bangladesh. However, it is crucial to consider that the cost of living in Pakistan is also relatively lower compared to other countries, which may offset the lower average salary.\n\nIs 2 lakh a good salary in Pakistan?\n\nYes, a salary of 2 lacks (200,000) Pakistani Rupees can be considered a good salary in Pakistan, depending on various factors such as the city or region, the job type, and the individual's lifestyle.\n\nPakistan has a relatively low cost of living compared to many other countries, and the cost of living can vary significantly between cities. For example, living expenses in Karachi are generally higher than in smaller towns.\n\nGenerally, a salary of 2 lahks per month is considered good in Pakistan, especially for entry-level or mid-level professionals. However, it may not be sufficient for individuals with high expenses or those living in expensive areas. Considering your circumstances and financial goals when determining whether a salary isIs Wd is alwimportant which.\n\nWhich salary is good in Pakistan?\n\nWhat salary is considered good in Pakistan can vary based on several factors, such as the city or region, job type, and the individual's lifestyle.\n\nSalaries in Pakistan vary widely depending on the industry and job type. For example, a fresh graduate may earn around 30,000 to 50,000 Pakistani Rupees monthly, while experienced professionals can earn up to several lakh rupees monthly.\n\nA salary of Rs. 50,000 to Rs. 100,000 per month can be considered a good salary for entry-level or mid-level professionals in Pakistan, depending on the city or region. In major cities like Karachi, Lahore, and Islamabad, where the cost of living is higher, a salary of around Rs. 100,000 per month or higher may be more suitable for a comfortable lifestyle.\n\nA good salary can also depend on an individual's lifestyle and expenses. For example, if someone has to support a large family or has significant financial obligations, they may require a higher salary to maintain a comfortable standard of living. Ultimately, what constitutes a good salary in Pakistan will depend on factors specific to each individual's circumstances.\n\nFAQs\n\nQ1. What is the minimum wage in Pakistan?\n\nA1.

{"text": "GDPRkids™ Readiness Checklist\n\nThe EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)came into force in 2018 and the UK's Children's Code came into force in September 2021 which has a statutory footing that would inform a GDPR enforcement action, but a surprising number of online services are still not fully compliant. What does this mean for businesses globally? Data controllers and processors need to adhere to the regulation if collecting and storing personal data of EU and UK citizens including children. The regulation provides the same rights for children that all data subjects enjoy but with added protections. Violations result in hefty fines. The Children's Code brings further enforceable requirements for industry. Here are our top tips to support your business to get in shape:\n\n1. Know what personal data you process. Do you know what you collect, where it comes from, and who you share it with? Users must be informed about the personal data collected and how it will be used before its collected. Transparent notice is key to obtaining valid consent if you rely on consent. When your users are children, it is a requirement to provide age-appropriate information. Notice must be provided for each purpose that personal data is processed. It is not valid to seek blanket consent from a data subject by asking them for example to agree to \"all our processing needs.\"\n\n2. Understand your data subject's rights in regard to their personal data. How well do you know the rights of your data subjects? Data subjects have rights over their personal data. Children have enhanced protection and rights. It is key to understand these rights and ensure you have process in place to meet them. In particular a child has the right to be forgotten, do you have a process in place to manage this?\n\n3. Verify role or age of minors.\n\nHow are you going to verify age according to the age of consent in each EU Member State? If your service attracts children, you have a responsibility to verify ageand seek a level of age assurance. There are a growing number of ways to do this and much industry discussion on age assurance vs age verification. It's important to take this step or there could be implications for your business. Recent headlines such as the TikTok case in Italy highlight this.\n\n4. Obtain parental consent if needed.\n\nDo you have a secure method of obtaining parent consent? Meaningful parental consent and how to obtain it will depend on the sensitivity of the personal data collected and the level of risk to the child. Understand what you are collecting, and processing and the level of consent needed from the holder of parental responsibility. For low risk data a simple opt in might suffice but in some cases the parent will need to be verified at a higher level and with a greater level of assurance.\n\n5. Be prepared in case of a data breach.\n\nDo you understand your obligations for data breach notification? A security information policy is key to storing personal data, but do you also have a data breach notification policy in place? What steps will you take in the event of a breach to investigate, inform and mitigate. These are key questions that need to be answered.\n\n6. Comply with the Children's Code.\n\nReview your app, website or other online service including to see if it adheres to the 15 standards in the Code. Ensure that you have a children's privacy policy that is clear and understandable to your audience age group, there is a high level of privacy by default and geo location tracking is off.\n\nPRIVO can support your app or site to ensure compliance and avoid violations. It's not too late to get your service in shape.

{"text": "What is Lactose Intolerance? Symptoms and Treatment\n\nHave you ever had an upset stomach after a dairy-heavy meal, or felt bloated after having too much cheese pizza? Lactose intolerance is quite common but is often ignored by those with symptoms.\n\nWhat exactly is lactose intolerance?\n\nLactose intolerance is an impaired ability to digest lactose, a sugar found in milk and other dairy products. Lactose intolerance is NOT an allergy. A milk allergy is an immune response to protein in cows' milk and results in skin rash, symptoms of inflammation of the esophagus or intestine or, occasionally with life-threatening anaphylaxis or shock. A food allergy happens when your immune system overreacts to a specific food protein, causing an allergic reaction. Unlike food allergies, food intolerances do not involve the immune system, but happen when an individual is missing the enzyme lactase (more on that below!). Milk allergies are generally diagnosed in the first year of life, while lactose intolerance occurs more often in adulthood.\n\nWhat happens in my body if I'm lactose intolerant?\n\nNormally, when someone eats something that contains lactose, an enzyme that's produced in your small intestine called lactase breaks down lactose into it's simpler components (which are simple sugars called glucose and galactose). These simple sugars are then able to be absorbed in the bloodstream and give you the energy you need.\n\nIf you have lactose intolerance, the body doesn't make enough lactase to break down lactose, and as a result allows undigested lactose molecules to pass to the lower parts of the intestine. At this point, the undigested lactose encounter bacteria which begin digestion through a process of fermentation. (2) The outcome of this fermentation (hydrogen, carbon dioxide, methane gases, and short-chain fatty acids) leads to many of the telltale symptoms for lactose intolerance – like gassiness and diarrhea.\n\nLactose intolerance is fairly common! You might be surprised to know that as you get older, you generally produce less and less lactase. By adulthood, up to 70% of people no longer produce enough lactase to properly digest the lactose in milk, leading to symptoms when they consume dairy. This is particularly common for people of non-European descent. (1)\n\nWhat are the symptoms of lactose intolerance?\n\nLactase deficiency varies from person to person – with some people being more affected than others. The likelihood and severity of symptoms depends on how little of the enzyme lactase you have, and the amount of lactose ingested. If the amount of lactose consumed overwhelms the available lactase, symptoms will develop.\n\nSymptoms of lactose intolerance follow the ingestion of milk or milk products and include:\n\nStomach cramps\n\nDiarrhea\n\nGassiness\n\nBloating\n\nNausea\n\nStomach pain and bloating\n\nStomach pain and bloating are common symptoms of lactose intolerance in both children and adults. When the body is unable to break down lactose, it passes through the gut until it reaches the colon. Carbohydrates such as lactose cannot be absorbed by the cells lining the colon, but they can be fermented and broken down by the naturally occurring bacteria that live there, known as the microflora.\n\nThis fermentation causes the release of short-chain fatty acids, as well as the gases hydrogen, methane and carbon dioxide. The resulting increase in acids and gases can lead to stomach pain and cramps. The pain is usually located around the navel (your belly button) and in the lower half of the tummy.\n\nThe sensation of bloating is caused by an increase of water and gas in the colon, which causes the gut wall to stretch, also known as distention. In severe cases, this can even lead to nausea and vomiting. (3)\n\nDiarrhea\n\nWe all experience this symptom from time to time. Lactose intolerance causes diarrhea by increasing the volume of water in the colon, which increases the volume and liquid content of the stool.\n\nIn the colon, microflora ferment lactose to short-chain fatty acids and gases. Most, but not all, of these acids are absorbed back into the colon. The leftover acids and lactose increase the amount of water that the body releases into the colon.\n\nThat being said, it is worth noting not all carbohydrates that cause diarrhea come from lactose. In fact, 2–20% of any carbohydrates consumed will reach the colon undigested in healthy people. (4)\n\nIncreased gas\n\nIn people with lactose intolerance, the colon microflora become very good at fermenting lactose into acids and gases. This results in more lactose being fermented in the colon, which further increases gassiness.\n\nThe amount of gas produced can differ enormously from person to person due to differences in the efficiency of the microflora, as well as the rate of gas reabsorption by the colon. (5)\n\nSo how do you treat lactose intolerance?\n\nWhile there is no actual cure for lactose intolerance, most people manage their symptoms by decreasing the amount of lactose in their diet or using commercially available lactase enzymes.\n\nDecreasing lactose intake\n\nA lactose-free diet excludes milk and milk products containing significant amounts of lactose. Lactose intolerance is not an all or none phenomenon, so reducing the amount of lactose in your diet rather than strict avoidance may be sufficient.\n\nLactose products avoid (or consume in moderation) include:\n\nRegular and low-fat milk\n\nRegular and low-fat yogurt\n\nCream\n\nIce cream\n\nMilk chocolate\n\nSoft cheeses, such as brie, cottage cheese and mozzarella\n\nTips: Things like butter and hard, aged cheeses such as parmesan, swiss and cheddar have much lower lactose content and may be easier to digest because most of the lactose is actually eliminated while the cheese is being made. Items such as dark chocolate, and probiotic yogurt are considered lower in lactose as well. Any of the products above labelled 'lactose-free' are also an excellent option!\n\nIt's important to note that people who are extremely sensitive to lactose must carefully read labels to detect unexpected sources. You might be surprised to know that lactose is often used as a filler in prescription and non-prescription tablets and may be a source of continuing symptoms in spite of a presumed lactose-free diet!\n\nLactose is also present in small amounts in a variety of processed foods. So be sure to check the ingredients and speak to a registered dietitian if you are unsure about food choices and wish to implement a lactose-free diet.\n\nLuckily, there are a number of alternative foods and drinks available in grocery stores to replace the milk and dairy products you may need to decrease consumption of. Food and drinks that do not usually contain lactose include products such as:\n\nPlant-based milk such as soya, almond, oat, and rice milk\n\nSoya or coconut-based yogurts and cheeses\n\nSherbert ice cream\n\nFoods with the \"dairy-free\" symbol such as dairy-free cream\n\nThere are also a large number of lactose-free dairy products available such as lactose-free milk, yogurt, cheeses, and ice cream that are great tasting and suitable for those with lactose-intolerance. These options allow someone living with lactose-intolerance to enjoy typical dairy products without sacrificing taste and quality!\n\nLactase enzymes\n\nTaking a lactase enzyme before you eat foods that contain dairy, may prevent the symptoms of lactose intolerance. Options include low-lactose milk with lactase, which is available in most grocery stores, and lactase tablets that are available in pharmacies. It's important to consult a registered dietician or your physician before beginning use of lactase tablets as a way to combat lactose intolerance. (7)\n\nConclusion\n\nThe simplest, and probably most reliable way of diagnosing whether an individual is lactose intolerant or not is to remove all lactose products from the diet for 1 to 2 weeks and see if the symptoms resolve. Keep in mind dairy products are an important source of calcium and vitamin D so those who avoid dairy need to ensure adequate sources, either through calcium/vitamin D supplements or calcium-rich non-dairy foods, including soya and other plant-based milks, tofu, green vegetables, fortified citrus juices, and lactose-free products with added calcium. (7)\n\nIf you are showing signs of lactose intolerance, it is important to consume products with lactose in moderation. Additionally, another option is introducing lactose-free variants of standard dairy products such as cheese, milk, and yogurt. Lactose-free alternatives can help you get back to enjoying the foods you love – without the side effects!", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "fdee80bc-4e3b-4360-a4d0-3ef5827107f7", "url": "https://cdhf.ca/en/what-is-lactose-intolerance-symptoms-and-treatment/"}

{"text": "How To Test Solar Panels\n\nTable Of Contents\n\nCheck That Your Solar Panels Are Working\n\nInstalling solar panels in your home helps reduce noise and environmental pollution. You also don't have to pay extra electricity bills as the energy is obtained from natural resources. Small local businesses often use solar panels to minimise their energy costs.\n\nSolar panels work by converting sunlight that falls on the PV cells into electrical energy. They need consistent care and maintenance because not testing your solar panels from time to time can risk your safety. Furthermore, the quality of unmaintained solar panels also reduces quickly, and they soon lose their efficiency.\n\nIn contrast, testing solar panels can increase their lifespan by up to 25 years. If you don't know how to test a solar panel, we are here to help. This article will run you through the steps to test a solar panel and the benefits of doing this regularly. So, let's dive right in!\n\nTesting Solar Panels\n\nHere are the top three ways to test solar panels quickly and detect any damage:\n\nMeasure open circuit voltage using a multimeter\n\nYou can test solar panels by using a multimeter to measure the open circuit voltage (Voc). Follow the below steps below to accurately calculate the open circuit voltage of your solar panel.\n\nSearch for the open circuit on the back of your solar panel.\n\nPrepare your multimeter to calculate the direct current volts. For this purpose, plug the probe into the COM (Common) terminal, and then plug the red probe into the voltage terminal.\n\nSet it yourself if the voltage range isn't auto-generated on your multimeter. It is usually denoted by a solid dark line above the dotted line, right next to the letter V.\n\nNext, take your solar panel outside and place it at an angle that faces the sunlight.\n\nFind the negative and positive solar panel cables. The positive solar panel cable has a red band around it and an MC4 connector.\n\nNow connect the black probe with the metal pin inside the negative cable MC4 and connect the red one with the metal pin inside the positive cable MC4.\n\nRead the voltage on your multimeter and check if it matches the Voc of your solar panel. If it matches or is around the Voc, your solar panel is working alright.\n\nHowever, if the voltage of the multimeter and solar panel doesn't match, it means your solar panel isn't in good condition, or you've made some mistakes while measuring.\n\nMeasure short circuit current\n\nMeasuring your solar panel's short circuit current (Isc) is another way of testing your solar panel condition. Here is the step-by-step process to calculate the ISC:\n\nFirst of all, find the short circuit current on the back of your solar panel.\n\nNext, prep your multimeter, connect the red probe to the amperage terminal, and set the amp range.\n\nTake your solar panel under direct sunlight and connect the red probe inside the metal pin of the positive cable MC4 and the black probe inside the metal pin of the negative cable MC4.\n\nCheck if the current on your multimeter is the same or near to the current on the solar panel. If yes, then your solar panel is good and working.\n\nUse a solar charge connector\n\nIf you find the above methods challenging, you can also check the efficiency of your solar panel through a solar charge connector. Through it, you can measure the PV voltage, current, and power output in watts.\n\nConnect the battery of the solar panel with the charge connector.\n\nNext, attach the watt meter in line with the charge controller adapter cables or wires.\n\nConnect the solar panel system with the charge connector to make a system that helps you calculate the power output.\n\nPlace your solar panel in direct sunlight. The watt meter will automatically start calculating the solar panels' output as soon as the sun rays hit the panel. This system can also check how much power your solar panel generates in a day.\n\nImportant Note: Once your watt meter turns off, it means the solar panel isn't giving any power output. After restarting, the watt meter will not show previous data and will start the calculation from zero again.\n\nReasons To Test Solar Panels Regularly\n\nRegular testing of your solar system not only enhances the lifespan of solar panels but also prevents you from several risks. Here are a few reasons solar panel testing is essential.\n\nCompliance with IEC rules\n\nIEC 62446 recommends that solar panel users periodically check their panels and maintain them well. This includes cleaning, commissioning tests, and examination of the PV system. The standard also specifies that you or a licensed professional should document every periodic checking, and if there's any issue, you or a trusted solar professional should repair it.\n\nPrevent fire spread\n\nAs solar panel installation on roofs is becoming popular, so is the news of homes catching fire. A common reason behind the sudden fire eruption is a fault in your solar panel PV system. So, when you keep up with the periodic testing of your solar panel, you can detect these minor issues that may turn into big problems and reduce the potential fire risk.\n\nGood grounding\n\nLike almost all electrical equipment, solar panels are also installed with grounded wiring to prevent anyone from getting electrocuted. If you don't inspect the ground wiring every now and then, it may degrade over time resulting in fire and electric shocks.\n\nThe electric shock may not be deadly but can cause severe injuries. Hence, it is always suggested to keep yourself updated with the grounding condition of your solar panels. You can also get the services of a professional electrician for this purpose.\n\nFaults in the ground wiring\n\nAs mentioned above, the solar system has the maximum amount of grounded wiring. So, suppose you've used poor insulation materials around these wires or cables. In that case, chances are that the energy generated from them will get dispersed into the earth, reducing the overall efficiency of your solar panel.\n\nTo avoid such a situation, you should get professional help and get your ground wiring checked to detect if there's any power leakage or not. Thereby, you can get the maximum potential out of your solar panel.\n\nCorrosion and environmental degradation\n\nThe sun is the energy source for solar panels, which is why they are placed outside, where they get maximum sunlight. However, PV systems are also very prone to environmental damages that may reduce their lifespan.\n\nThe cabling and other connections also get damaged due to the consistent exposure to harmful elements, increasing the fire risk. That's why you should do regular system maintenance to avoid all these issues and fix any minor ones on time.\n\nWarranty completion\n\nThe product warranty card rules may demand regular checking and monitoring of PV solar systems to avoid problems caused by your negligence. This is because solar companies usually don't give a refund or replacement for a product damaged by one's irresponsibility.\n\nCauses Of Damage To Your Solar Panels\n\nSince the solar panel is mainly made of glass, it is prone to damage. Let's quickly look at a few factors that damage the quality of your solar panels.\n\nFalling dirt or debris\n\nIt doesn't matter how small the debris is; it can cause minor scratches on your panel's screen. These include twigs, leaves, or dirt. The scratches reduce your solar panels' energy output and prevent sunlight from reaching the PV cells.\n\nAs a result, the overall energy usage goes up. The heavier the dirt, the more the damage. For instance, branches falling on the panel can break them completely.\n\nHail storm\n\nNatural disasters like unexpected hail storms can destroy your costly solar panels. You can't do much about it. However, if you dwell in an area where storms are typical or have a hail storm warning, you should take proper preventive measures to save your solar panels.\n\nWater leakage\n\nDo you know the constant minor leakage in your home is damaging the efficiency of your solar panels? When sealant gets worn out, this causes water to erupt through walls and enter the solar panels. This results in a severe short circuit or burning of the solar panels.\n\nHarmful elements\n\nSolar panels are made of small wafer-like silicone cells or chips. So, when the elements present in nature cause natural and mechanical stress on the panel, tiny cracks appear on its surface that aren't visible to the human eye. You can't protect your solar panel from them; however, if you have a warranty card, the company will refund or give you a new replacement for the cracked panel.\n\nRepairing Broken Solar Panels\n\nIf your negligence or a storm has resulted in broken solar panels, you can repair them by following these steps:\n\nFirst, get a laminating sheet, squeegee, and heat gun.\n\nSpread the whole broken panel with the laminating sheet as it's a cost-effective way of repairing the broken glass of the panel.\n\nNow use the squeegee and heat gun to press and fix the sheet at the edges of the panel.\n\nAnd that's it; your panel is sealed!\n\nSolar panels still work even though they are broken, but it's suggested to cover them because moisture can quickly enter through the cracks, causing short circuits or a sudden burn.\n\nTypes Of Solar Panels\n\nMonocrystalline solar panels\n\nMonocrystalline is the right option if you are looking for an efficient solar panel. You can easily recognise them through their dark and uniform texture. These solar PV panels have the highest power output rate, occupy little space, and last longer than the others available in the market.\n\nFurthermore, they are also least affected by any environmental change. But all these features mean they are the most expensive ones, and not everyone can afford them.\n\nPolycrystalline solar panels\n\nYou can quickly identify these solar panels as they have square-shaped blocks with no edges and are blue in colour. They are made of melted raw silicone, which is a cheaper and less efficient material compared to monocrystalline. Their efficiency is about 15%, which is also less than monocrystalline solar panels, but they work great for home usage.\n\nYou can get these solar panels at a low price, but the power output is the same as the monocrystalline ones. However, they can easily get affected by sudden temperature changes, specifically by hot temperatures.\n\nThin-film solar cells\n\nIf you want a cheaper option, you should use thin film solar panels. These solar panels are manufactured by placing multiple films of photovoltaic material like silicone, cadmium, or copper on a substrate. They are straightforward to manufacture and a budget-friendly option for people who want to cut their electricity bills.\n\nMoreover, thin film solar panels are flexible and are resistant to environmental damage. Their one downside is that they take a lot of space, so they're not the best option for residential usage. You should also know that their lifespan is much lower; hence, they can stop working after a few months of use.\n\nAmorphous silicon solar panels\n\nThese solar panels look a lot like solar-powered calculators as the primary manufacturing material is the same in both. The thin film used in these panels has a diameter of 1 micrometre, while the efficiency is 7 percent, which is a lot lower than all the above-discussed types of solar panels. You can use it for supporting small appliances as it's the most economical solar panel available on the market.\n\nRepair Or Replace Damaged Solar Panels\n\nTesting a solar panel is essential as it saves you from several potential safety risks. Moreover, it also enhances your solar panel's efficiency so that you can save on your overall energy usage. If you detect any issues with your solar panels after testing them, it is crucial to contact a solar professional to help repair or replace the panels, as the case may be.", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "103fbf92-7fd5-4307-9085-911bcd65cd66", "url": "https://www.greensparkelectrical.com.au/blog/how-to-test-solar-panels"}

{"text": "Regular Floods Expected around Lake Turkana, UNEP Says\n\nThough Lake Turkana which sits in the arid part of northern Kenya appeared to be drying up, a new report shows that climate change could lead to an increase in its water levels.\n\nAccording to the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP) report, over the next 20 years, climate change could likely lead to heavier rains over Lake Turkana's river inflows, which would raise water levels in the lake itself and increase the likelihood of severe flooding.\n\nThe study urged officials in Kenya and Ethiopia, which both border Lake Turkana, to prepare for a future in which once-rare floods, such as those that hit the region in 2019 and 2020, are regular occurrences.\n\n\"Many people think that climate change is a problem for the future,\" says Frank Turyatunga, Deputy Head of UNEP's Africa Office in a statement. \"But as Lake Turkana shows, it's happening now and it's already forcing people to adapt to new conditions.\"\n\nLake Turkana, the world's largest desert lake, is part of the Omo-Turkana basin, which stretches into four countries: Ethiopia, Kenya, South Sudan and Uganda. The basin is home to many rare plants and animals.\n\nSince 1988, Ethiopia has built a series of hydroelectric dams on its main tributary, the Omo River, leading to predictions of Lake Turkana's demise.\n\nIts main river inflows had been muffled by dams and many feared water levels were poised to drop by two-thirds, causing the lake to cleave into two smaller bodies of water. It was, one report said , an African \" Aral Sea disaster in the making\" – where only 10 per cent remains of the original sea.\n\n\"There is still a mindset in Kenya that lake water levels are constantly falling, which makes planning difficult,\" said Tito Ochieng, Director of Water, Turkana County in a statement.\n\nClimate projections\n\nUsing sophisticated water resources modeling and climate change scenario analysis, the new UNEP report found that up to eight human settlements around the lake could be inundated by flooding periodically. While severe, abrupt flooding has been rare, climate change projections foresee this becoming more regular and impacting more people if adaptation measures are not put in place.\n\nThe report called for improved international cooperation and adaptation measures, including reforestation, agroforestry and avoiding construction in areas at risk of flooding.\n\n\"In the last two years, rising water levels in Lake Turkana have damaged pastureland, inundated buildings and forced people to flee their homes,\" says Tito Ochieng, Director of Water in Kenya's Turkana County. \"But there is still a mindset in Kenya that lake water levels are constantly falling, which makes planning difficult.\"\n\nThe study also found evidence of rising water levels in the eight lakes that line Kenya's Rift Valley. Severe flooding in those lakes in 2019 and 2020 damaged homes and infrastructure – and even reportedly led to a spike in deadly crocodile attacks.\n\nAfrica remains to be the most vulnerable region in the world to climate change fuelled by the prevailing low levels of socioeconomic growth in the continent.\n\nThe report was part of a wider project designed to accelerate cooperation in the border areas between Ethiopia, Kenya and Somalia.\n\nThe project also developed an open-source information portal on the basin, based in part on satellite imagery. It contains data on land cover, water quality and soil moisture, and examines the various climate change scenarios.\n\nScience Africa Limited is a media house specializing in science and health journalism and communication, development support communication, and publishing.

Ancient names are often associated with great historical figures, mythological heroes, or religious icons, and can carry a sense of timelessness and tradition.\n\nWhen choosing an ancient name, it is important to consider the meaning and symbolism behind the name. Many ancient names have rich and complex meanings that reflect the values and beliefs of the culture that originated them. For example, the name \"Aurelia,\" which was popular in ancient Rome, means \"golden\" and was often associated with prosperity and wealth.\n\nAnother important factor to consider is the pronunciation and spelling of the name. Many ancient names may have unusual or unfamiliar spellings or pronunciations, which can be difficult for others to understand or pronounce correctly. It is important to choose a name that is easy to spell and pronounce, while still maintaining its unique and historical character.\n\nIt is also important to consider the cultural context of the name. Some ancient names may be associated with specific cultures or religions, and it is important to be respectful of these traditions when choosing a name. For example, the name \"Mohammed\" is a popular name in the Islamic world, but may not be appropriate for someone who is not part of that culture or religion.\n\nUltimately, the choice of an ancient name should reflect the values and beliefs of the parents and the family, while also honoring the rich history and cultural heritage that the name represents.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\nWhat are some unique historical boy names with powerful meanings?\n\nAchilles: warrior\n\nAtlas: enduring\n\nCastor: beaver\n\nHector: steadfast\n\nOrion: rising in the sky\n\nPerseus: destroyer\n\nTheseus: to set\n\nWhat are some strong historical girl names with ancient origins?\n\nArtemis: goddess of the hunt\n\nCassandra: prophetess\n\nDaphne: laurel tree\n\nElectra: shining\n\nGaia: earth\n\nHera: queen of the gods\n\nMedea: cunning\n\nWhat are some ancient names for warriors that signify strength and bravery?\n\nAjax: powerful eagle\n\nLeonidas: lion's son\n\nOdysseus: wrathful\n\nSpartacus: from Sparta\n\nThor: thunder\n\nUlysses: angry, wrathful\n\nXerxes: ruler over heroes\n\nWhat are some powerful ancient female names that represent leadership and wisdom?\n\nCleopatra: glory of the father\n\nIsis: throne\n\nMinerva: wisdom\n\nNefertiti: the beautiful one has come\n\nPandora: all gifted\n\nSappho: wise\n\nWhat are some immortal names from ancient cultures that are still used today?\n\nAlexander: defender of the people (Greek)\n\nDiana: divine (Roman)\n\nJulius: youthful (Roman)\n\nMarcus: warlike (Roman)\n\nSophia: wisdom (Greek)\n\nVictoria: victory (Roman)\n\n\\n\n\nAchilles: warrior\n\n\\n\n\nAtlas: enduring\n\n\\n\n\nCastor: beaver\n\n\\n\n\nHector: steadfast\n\n\\n\n\nOrion: rising in the sky\n\n\\n\n\nPerseus: destroyer\n\n\\n\n\nTheseus: to set\n\n\\n\n\n\"}},{\"@type\":\"Question\",\"name\":\"What are some strong historical girl names with ancient origins?\",\"acceptedAnswer\":{\"@type\":\"Answer\",\"text\":\"\n\n\\n\n\nArtemis: goddess of the hunt\n\n\\n\n\nCassandra: prophetess\n\n\\n\n\nDaphne: laurel tree\n\n\\n\n\nElectra: shining\n\n\\n\n\nGaia: earth\n\n\\n\n\nHera: queen of the gods\n\n\\n\n\nMedea: cunning\n\n\\n\n\n\"}},{\"@type\":\"Question\",\"name\":\"What are some ancient names for warriors that signify strength and bravery?\",\"acceptedAnswer\":{\"@type\":\"Answer\",\"text\":\"\n\n\\n\n\nAjax: powerful eagle\n\n\\n\n\nLeonidas: lion's son\n\n\\n\n\nOdysseus: wrathful\n\n\\n\n\nSpartacus: from Sparta\n\n\\n\n\nThor: thunder\n\n\\n\n\nUlysses: angry, wrathful\n\n\\n\n\nXerxes: ruler over heroes\n\n\\n\n\n\"}},{\"@type\":\"Question\",\"name\":\"What are some powerful ancient female names that represent leadership and wisdom?\",\"acceptedAnswer\":{\"@type\":\"Answer\",\"text\":\"\n\n\\n\n\nCleopatra: glory of the father\n\n\\n\n\nIsis: throne\n\n\\n\n\nMinerva: wisdom\n\n\\n\n\nNefertiti: the beautiful one has come\n\n\\n\n\nPandora: all gifted\n\n\\n\n\nSappho: wise\n\n\\n\n\n\"}},{\"@type\":\"Question\",\"name\":\"What is the oldest recorded name in history?\",\"acceptedAnswer\":{\"@type\":\"Answer\",\"text\":\"\n\nThe oldest recorded name in history is Kushim, a Sumerian name dating back to 3400 BCE.\n\n\"}},{\"@type\":\"Question\",\"name\":\"What are some immortal names from ancient cultures that are still used today", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "bdbb71ad-9a80-4062-b6fd-ff767d0c23c1", "url": "https://www.eslbuzz.com/ancient-names/"}
{"text": "Revenue Management for Manufacturers\n\nRevenue drives business. An initial response is to say—more is better. But on reflection, you know that isn't true. Revenue must be profitable to be desirable. And profitability means more than gross margin. Understanding profitability takes a coordinated organizational effort involving marketing, sales, finance, operations, and logistics. Coordination requires revenue and cost information that is causal, reflects operations and economic reality, and is agreed upon across the organization. It also requires an understanding of the basic principles of revenue management which is a topic that surprisingly is missing from both accounting and marketing educational curriculum. A recent Statement on Management Accounting (SMA) by the Institute of Management Accountants titled Revenue Management Fundamentals outlines the core principles.\n\nA few key concepts include: understanding your customer segments, knowing what characteristics customer groups value about your products, and designing your products to efficiently and profitably respond to those demands. Consider the accompanying graphic to this article—it illustrates the benefits of responding to customer segments with variations in products or associated services.\n\n4 Levers of Revenue Management Revenue management has four levers that help you understand and manage the operational response to customer variability.\n\nLever 1—Pricing Basis: This lever is obvious. You need to determine how much customers will pay for the differentiation desired so that you can decide if it is profitable for you to produce or offer it. Alternatively, can you remove some capabilities or services, reduce price, and gain more less demanding customers profitably? It is important to remember pricing is set by the market and customer value; your cost determines if you should be in the that line of business.\n\nLever 2—Inventory Allocation: This refers to both physical inventory available and the inventory of productive capability. Are you collecting the demand information about your customers and customer segments to adapt your inventory of products, associated services, and productive capability to the most advantageous and profitable components of demand? Rush orders, late orders, the size of orders, the seasonality of orders, and many other characteristics are attributes of the product or the associated services that can be managed with a price response and/or a customer desirability determination. Do you have enough information about customer profitability and control over your selling and production to ensure your inventory and productive capacity is going to your most profitable customers? Can you use slow periods to bring in less profitable customers?\n\nLever 3—Product Configuration: This lever involves both physical product configuration and non-physical elements such as terms and conditions or customer education/consulting. Have you identified the key physical and non-physical attributes that your customer segments value? What is your ability to profitably adapt a product, its features, and its associated services to customer demands? Are you meeting the demands of the customers that have the potential to improve profitability because they are willing to pay for more profitable features and service?\n\nLever 4—Duration Control: This lever involves collecting the information and using operating and process changes to predict or shape customer behavior to enable improvements in profitability. Normally, the goal is to make customers more predictable and optimize your time and effort to meet their demands. Duration control can involve internal process changes or changes that involve customer communication or interaction. Examples may include incentives to order more regularly, when to focus sales force efforts, improvements in order picking/packing/shipping, improvements in customer order acceptance procedures, etc.\n\nToo often organizations focus on increasing sales revenue or reducing product cost. This concentration of effort leaves a great deal of the customer experience unexplored. Revenue management focuses on the profitability of existing and new sales by understanding what segments customers value, are willing to pay for, and how the organization can adapt itself and customer behavior to meet those needs profitably.", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "0818eb4a-7f75-4555-9ea3-a71014d89d23", "url": "https://www.automationworld.com/analytics/article/22302163/revenue-management-for-manufacturers"}
{"text": "Controlling humidity levels and maintaining the HVAC system are crucial in preventing mold growth.\n\nThe Importance of Mold Remediation\n\nYou should prioritize mold remediation to ensure the safety and well-being of your home and its occupants. Mold growth in your home can have serious consequences for both your health and the structural integrity of your property.\n\nMold spores are microscopic particles that float in the air and can easily be inhaled. When mold spores find a damp environment with organic material, such as wood or drywall, they can start to multiply and grow. This can lead to the development of mold colonies, which release even more spores into the air. Breathing in these spores can cause a range of health issues, including respiratory problems, allergies, and even infections.\n\nIn addition to the health risks, mold can also damage your home. Mold can weaken the structural integrity of materials, leading to costly repairs or even the need for replacement. It can also cause unsightly stains and odors that are difficult to remove.\n\nBy prioritizing mold remediation, you can prevent these problems from occurring or getting worse. A professional mold remediation service will assess the extent of the mold growth, identify the source of moisture, and safely remove the mold from your home. They'll also take steps to prevent future mold growth, such as repairing leaks or improving ventilation.\n\nTaking prompt action to address mold issues not only protects your health but also preserves the value and condition of your property. Don't underestimate the importance of mold remediation in ensuring the safety and well-being of your home and its occupants. Act now to create a healthy and mold-free living environment.\n\nCommon Signs of Mold Infestation\n\nTo identify a mold infestation in your home, be on the lookout for common signs of mold growth. Mold can grow in various areas of your home, including bathrooms, basements, and attics.\n\nOne of the most obvious signs of mold is a musty odor. If you notice a strong, unpleasant smell that persists despite regular cleaning, it could be a sign of hidden mold growth.\n\nKeep an eye out for any visible signs of mold as well. Mold can appear as black, green, or brown spots on walls, ceilings, or other surfaces. It may also appear as fuzzy patches or discoloration on fabrics, carpets, or furniture.\n\nAnother common sign of mold is an increase in allergic reactions or respiratory problems. If you or your family members are experiencing unexplained allergies, coughing, wheezing, or difficulty breathing, it could be due to mold spores in the air.\n\nAdditionally, water leaks or excessive moisture in your home can contribute to mold growth. If you notice any water stains, water damage, or peeling paint, it's important to investigate further as these can indicate a moisture problem that may be fostering mold growth.\n\nLastly, if you have recently experienced a flood or water damage event, it's crucial to thoroughly inspect the affected area for mold growth, as it can begin to develop within 24-48 hours.\n\nSteps Involved in Mold Remediation Process\n\nTo effectively address a mold infestation in your home, follow a series of steps involved in the mold remediation process.\n\nThe first step is to identify the source of moisture that's causing the mold growth. This could be due to leaks in pipes, roofs, or windows, or even high humidity levels in certain areas of your home.\n\nOnce the source of moisture is identified and fixed, the next step is to contain the affected area to prevent the spread of mold spores to other parts of your home. This can be done by sealing off the contaminated area with plastic sheets and using negative air pressure machines to ensure that the mold spores don't escape.\n\nAfter containment, the next step is to remove the mold-infested materials. This involves carefully removing and disposing of any materials that are heavily contaminated with mold, such as drywall, carpeting, and insulation. Special care should be taken during this step to avoid spreading the mold spores further.\n\nOnce the contaminated materials are removed, the affected area needs to be thoroughly cleaned and sanitized. This includes scrubbing surfaces with a mold-killing solution and using HEPA vacuums to remove any remaining mold spores.\n\nFinally, it's important to address the underlying cause of the mold infestation to prevent future growth. This may involve fixing plumbing issues, improving ventilation, or addressing any other sources of moisture in your home. Regular inspections and maintenance can also help in detecting and preventing mold growth in the future.\n\nHiring Professional Mold Remediation Experts\n\nIf you're dealing with a mold infestation in your home, consider hiring professional mold remediation experts. While you may think that tackling the problem yourself can save you money, it's important to understand the benefits of hiring professionals who specialize in mold remediation.\n\nHere are four reasons why it's worth investing in their services:\n\nExpertise and Experience: Mold remediation experts have the knowledge and experience to effectively identify and remove mold from your home. They're trained in the latest techniques and have access to specialized equipment that allows them to handle even the most severe mold infestations.\n\nSafety: Dealing with mold can be hazardous to your health. Mold spores can easily become airborne during the removal process, leading to respiratory issues and allergic reactions. Professional mold remediation experts know how to effectively contain and remove mold without putting your health at risk.\n\nPrevention: After removing mold from your home, professionals can also help you implement preventive measures to minimize the chances of future mold growth. This may include recommendations for improving ventilation, addressing water leaks, and reducing humidity levels in your home.\n\nPreventive Measures to Avoid Future Mold Growth\n\nImplement preventative measures to avoid future mold growth in your home. By taking proactive steps, you can minimize the risk of mold infestation and maintain a healthy living environment.\n\nStart by identifying and addressing any moisture issues in your home. Moisture is the primary catalyst for mold growth, so it's crucial to keep your home dry and well-ventilated.\n\nRegularly inspect your home for any leaks or water damage. Check for signs of dampness in areas such as bathrooms, kitchens, basements, and attics.

{"text": "Unraveling the Non-Refundable Portion of the Employee Retention Credit\n\nIn recent times, economic uncertainties have compelled businesses to look for every available avenue to sustain operations and protect their workforce. Significant relief in this regard has been provided by the Employee Retention Credit (ERC), a tax incentive aimed at encouraging employers to retain their staff during challenging economic phases. Introduced as part of the CARES Act, the ERC has since been a cornerstone in alleviating the financial strain on businesses.\n\nThe ERC is broken into two main categories: the refundable and non-refundable portions. The refundable portion allows employers to receive a refund from the IRS if the credit exceeds the total amount owed in payroll taxes.\n\nOn the other hand, the non-refundable portion can only reduce the tax liability to zero without refunding any excess credit. While many employers have a fairly good grasp of the refundable segment of the ERC, the non-refundable portion often leaves room for ambiguity.\n\nAs we navigate through the intricacies of the non-refundable tax credit, it's our goal to provide a clear understanding that empowers businesses to optimize their tax positions effectively.\n\nWhat Is the Non-Refundable Portion of the Employee Retention Credit?\n\nIn the realm of taxation, credits are conceived as a direct reduction in the tax liability, unlike deductions which reduce the amount of income subject to taxation. Tax credits are further delineated into refundable and non-refundable credits, each with distinct functionalities.\n\nNon-refundable credits are aptly named as they can reduce a taxpayer's liability to zero, but not beyond that point. Any excess amount from non-refundable credits does not translate to a refund nor is carried forward to subsequent tax years. In essence, while they can significantly lower a tax bill, they halt at the zero mark and vanish thereafter.\n\nThe non-refundable part of the Employee Retention Credit (ERC) essentially covers a portion of the employer's payroll taxes, which could be either from Social Security tax or Medicare, based on when the claim is made. If the wages were paid between March 12, 2020, and July 1, 2021, this part of the credit is calculated using the employer's 6.2% share of Social Security taxes.\n\nOn the other hand, if the qualified wages were paid between July 1, 2021, and December 31, 2021, this part is calculated using the employer's 1.45% share of Medicare taxes. It's important to use the non-refundable part of the ERC first to lower the employer's tax bill, but it can only bring the tax bill down to zero, not below that.\n\nNon-refundable portion: The non-refundable portion of the ERC is primarily used to offset the employer's share of Medicare tax. It's applied against the employer's payroll tax liability. If the ERC exceeds the payroll tax liability, any remaining non-refundable credit amount isn't returned as a refund to the employer;\n\nRefundable portion: The refundable portion of the ERC, on the other hand, goes beyond covering payroll taxes. It allows businesses to receive a refund for the excess credit amount, meaning that if the ERC exceeds the total payroll tax liability and other applicable liabilities, the remaining amount is returned as a cash refund to the employer.\n\nThe applicability of these portions depends on the specific circumstances of each business. Understanding when and how to use each portion is key to maximizing the benefits of the ERC while ensuring compliance with tax regulations.\n\nERC Portion\n\nPurpose\n\nApplication\n\nNon-Refundable\n\nOffset Medicare Tax\n\nApplied against employer's payroll tax liability.\n\nRefundable\n\nExcess Credit Refund\n\nRefunded if ERC exceeds total tax liabilities.\n\n‍\n\nQualifying for the Non-Refundable Portion of ERC\n\nThe non-refundable portion of the Employee Retention Credit (ERC) is subject to specific criteria and eligibility requirements that businesses must meet to claim the credit. Here's an overview of what it takes to qualify for the non-refundable portion and how it differs from the refundable portion.\n\nCriteria and Eligibility Requirements for the Non-Refundable Portion\n\nEmployer size: To qualify for the non-refundable portion, your business must meet certain size criteria. Generally, eligible employers are those with 500 or fewer full-time employees. However, there are exceptions for certain businesses, including those that experienced a partial or full suspension of operations due to government orders or a significant decline in gross receipts;\n\nEligibility period: The non-refundable ERC is available for specific periods. Initially, it applied to wages paid between March 13, 2020, and December 31, 2020. Subsequently, it was extended through June 30, 2021. Make sure your business meets the eligibility criteria for the relevant periods;\n\nOperations suspension or gross receipts decline: The non-refundable portion is primarily aimed at businesses that faced government-mandated suspensions or experienced a significant decline in gross receipts during the eligible periods. You need to be able to demonstrate these circumstances to claim this portion.\n\nDifferences from the Refundable Portion of ERC\n\nPurpose: The non-refundable portion of the ERC is primarily intended to offset the employer's share of Medicare tax, while the refundable portion has a broader purpose, including refunding any excess credit;\n\nEligibility focus: The non-refundable portion places a more significant emphasis on the specific circumstances of your business, such as operations suspension or gross receipts decline, compared to the refundable portion;\n\nEmployer size: Both portions generally consider employers with 500 or fewer full-time employees, but exceptions may apply. Ensure you meet the size criteria for the respective portion.\n\nUnderstanding the distinct criteria and eligibility requirements for the non-refundable portion of the ERC is important for businesses that want to claim this credit while complying with tax regulations.\n\n‍\n\nIf I Get More Employee Retention Credit than My Tax Amount, Do I Lose the Extra?\n\nNo, you won't lose the extra credit. If your Employee Retention Credit (ERC) is more than your tax amount, you can still get the full benefit if you file your taxes on time. The ERC has two parts: a non-refundable part and a refundable part. The extra credit amount beyond the non-refundable part is considered as your refundable credit.\n\nThe refundable part is great because it can take your tax bill below zero, meaning you could get a tax refund. So, when you claim the ERC on a special form (Form 941-X), you might end up with a tax refund that's bigger than the tax you paid for that period. After you send in Form 941-X, you can check to see if the IRS got your form and keep track of your ERC refund.\n\nNon-Refundable Portion of the ERC: Affect on Tax Liability and Financial Standing\n\nThe non-refundable portion of the Employee Retention Tax Credit directly impacts a business's tax liability by reducing the amount of payroll taxes owed. This reduction can significantly bolster a company's financial standing, especially in times of economic strain.\n\nHowever, the benefit is bounded by the amount of tax liability a business has for that specific quarter. For businesses with minimal tax liability, the non-refundable portion may offer limited relief. On the flip side, for businesses with a higher tax liability, the non-refundable portion can offer substantial savings that free up funds that can be channeled toward other pressing needs.\n\nIn summary, while the non-refundable portion of the Employee Retention Tax Credit offers a valuable financial reprieve, the extent of its impact is intertwined with a business's tax circumstances and its ability to navigate the associated tax compliance landscape accurately.\n\nCommon Mistakes to Avoid with the Non-Refundable ERC\n\nWhen it comes to the non-refundable Employee Retention Credit, it's important to avoid common mistakes and misconceptions.\n\nWe've provided some pitfalls to steer clear of and tips to help you navigate the process effectively:\n\nIneligible wages: Ensure that the wages you claim for the non-refundable ERC fall within the eligible timeframes and meet the specific criteria. Misidentifying eligible wages can lead to overestimation;\n\nMismatched timeframes: Pay close attention to the periods for which the non-refundable ERC applies. Using the wrong timeframe can result in miscalculations;\n\nDouble-dipping: Avoid claiming the same wages for multiple COVID-19 relief programs, such as the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) and ERC, for the same periods. Double-dipping can lead to penalties.\n\nDeadlines and Important Dates for the Employee Retention Credit\n\nNavigating the Employee Retention Credit (ERC) requires being keen on certain deadlines to ensure you maximize the benefits while remaining compliant.\n\nHere are the key dates and deadlines for the nonrefundable portion of the Employee Retention Credit:\n\nFiling Deadlines for Previous Years\n\nIf you haven't claimed the ERC for the tax years 2020 and 2021, it's not too late. The filing deadline for the 2020 tax year is April 15, 2024, while for the 2021 tax year, it's April 15, 2025.\n\nExtended Filing Provisions\n\nMoreover, businesses that missed claiming the credit for 2020 and 2021 have an extended opportunity to claim until April 15, 2024, or within three years from the date of their original tax return filing or two years from the date the tax was paid, whichever comes later.\n\nProcessing Delays\n\nBe aware that as of September 14, 2023, the processing of new ERC claims has been delayed, although claims filed before this date will continue to be processed. This delay could potentially affect all amended employment tax returns, even those without an ERC claim​.\n\nBeing mindful of these deadlines is crucial to ensure timely filing and to optimize the benefits from the non-refundable portion of the ERC. We advise you to consult with a tax professional to better understand the implications and to ensure accurate compliance with the ERC guidelines.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nIn summary, the non-refundable portion of the Employee Retention Credit (ERC) serves as a valuable tool for reducing your federal tax liability. It effectively lowers your tax payable to zero, ensuring you won't owe additional money to the state. However, it's important to note that non-refundable tax credits don't result in a tax refund themselves.\n\nAs you navigate the ERC landscape, remember that our trusted CPA firm, Lewis CPA, boasts over 25 years of experience.

{"text": "Why the Continuation of Transformation during an Economic Downturn is Critical for Stability\n\nUpdated: Aug 5, 2023\n\nWhy the Continuation of Transformation during an Economic Downturn is Critical for Stability\n\n1. IntroductionIn today's rapidly changing business landscape, organisations are constantly challenged to adapt and evolve. While presenting significant challenges, economic downturns can also be opportunities for growth and innovation. In this article, we will explore why the continuation of transformation during an economic downturn is critical for the organisation's long-term stability. We'll delve into why organisations should not take their foot off the gas during these times and instead embrace the power of transformation.2. Understanding TransformationTransformation, in the context of organisations, refers to the process of making fundamental changes to the way they operate, strategise, and deliver value. It involves adopting new technologies, improving business processes, and fostering a culture of innovation. There are various types of transformation, including digital transformation, organisational transformation, and cultural transformation, each with its own focus and objectives.2.1 What is transformation?\n\nTransformation involves rethinking and reinventing the way organisations work internally and externally. It requires a shift in mindset, embracing change as an opportunity rather than a threat. By embracing transformation, organisations can stay competitive, meet customer expectations, and drive growth.\n\n2.2 Types of Transformation\n\nDigital Transformation: Digital transformation involves leveraging technology to improve operational efficiency, enhance customer experiences, and drive innovation. It entails integrating digital technologies into all aspects of the organisation, from processes and products to customer interactions and business models.\n\nOrganisational Transformation: Organisational transformation focuses on changing the structure, processes, and culture of an organisation to improve agility, collaboration, and performance. It may involve redesigning workflows, restructuring teams, or implementing new management practices.\n\n3. Economic Downturn: A Time of ChallengeDuring an economic downturn, organisations face numerous challenges, such as reduced consumer spending, market uncertainty, and financial constraints. These challenges can have a significant impact on the stability and survival of organisations.3.1 Impact of the economic downturn on Organisations\n\nEconomic downturns can lead to reduced demand for products or services, lower revenue, and increased competition. Organisations may experience financial strain, workforce reductions, and decreased customer loyalty. It becomes crucial for organisations to navigate these challenges effectively to maintain their long-term stability.\n\n3.2 Why transformation is critical during an economic downturn\n\nTransformation becomes even more critical during an economic downturn, enabling organisations to adapt and thrive in challenging environments. Organisations can identify new opportunities, streamline operations, and develop resilience by continuing transformation efforts. It allows them to stay ahead of the competition and position themselves for future growth.\n\n4. The Importance of Long-term StabilityLong-term stability is a crucial factor for the success and sustainability of organisations. It provides a solid foundation for growth, fosters stakeholder trust, and ensures business continuity. Let's explore the benefits of long-term stability and the challenges organisations face without it.4.1 Benefits of long-term stability\n\nLong-term stability provides organisations with the following benefits:\n\nOrganisations that lack long-term stability face the following challenges:\n\nUncertainty and Risk: Instability increases tension, making it difficult to plan and make confident business decisions. It exposes organisations to higher risks.\n\nCompetitive Disadvantage: Unstable organisations need help to stay competitive in dynamic markets. They may need to catch up regarding innovation, customer satisfaction, or operational efficiency.\n\nStakeholder Confidence: Without long-term stability, stakeholders, including investors, customers, and employees, may lose confidence in the organisation's ability to deliver consistent value.\n\n5. Continuation of TransformationWhile economic downturns may tempt organisations to halt their transformation efforts, doing so can be detrimental to their long-term stability. Let's explore why organisations tend to stop transformation during economic downturns and its associated risks.5.1 Why organisations tend to halt transformation during an economic downturn\n\nEconomic downturns often lead organisations to prioritise short-term cost-cutting measures and immediate financial stability. This short-sighted approach can overshadow the long-term benefits of transformation, leading to a pause or abandonment of ongoing initiatives.\n\n5.2 Risks of stopping transformation during an economic downturn\n\nStopping transformation during an economic downturn poses several risks:\n\nMissed Opportunities: Organisations may miss out on opportunities for growth, innovation, and competitive advantage during challenging times.\n\nInflexibility: Without ongoing transformation, organisations may become rigid and struggle to adapt to changing market dynamics or customer demands.\n\nDeclining Relevance: Pausing transformation efforts can result in the organisation falling behind competitors who continue to evolve and meet changing customer needs.\n\n6. Strategies for Continuing TransformationOrganisations can adopt several strategies to ensure the continuation of transformation during an economic downturn. These strategies can help organisations overcome the challenges and risks associated with economic downturns.6.1 Adapting transformation goals\n\nOrganisations should reassess and align their transformation goals with the current economic landscape. This involves identifying critical areas for survival and prioritising initiatives that deliver immediate value while keeping long-term goals in mind.\n\n6.2 Allocating resources wisely\n\nDuring an economic downturn, resource allocation becomes crucial. Organisations should carefully evaluate and optimise their resources to ensure they are allocated to transformation initiatives with the highest impact. This may involve reprioritising budgets, reallocating personnel, or seeking external partnerships.\n\n6.3 Fostering a Culture of Innovation\n\nA culture of innovation is essential for the continuation of transformation. Organisations should encourage employees to generate and implement creative ideas, experiment with new approaches, and embrace a growth mindset. This can be achieved through open communication, collaboration, and recognition of innovative efforts.\n\n7. Overcoming ObstaclesContinuing transformation during an economic downturn comes with its fair share of obstacles. However, organisations can overcome these challenges with the right strategies and approaches.7.1 Managing Resistance to Change\n\nResistance to change is a common obstacle during transformation initiatives. To address this, organisations should focus on effective change management, including clear communication, involving employees in decision-making, and providing training and support. Engaging employees and addressing their concerns can help mitigate resistance and facilitate smooth transformation.\n\n7.2 Addressing resource constraints\n\nEconomic downturns often come with resource constraints. Organisations should explore innovative ways to overcome these constraints, such as leveraging technology, optimising processes, or seeking external funding. Strategic resource management and collaboration can help organisations make the most of limited resources.\n\n8. The Role of LeadershipLeadership plays a vital role in driving and sustaining transformation during an economic downturn. Leaders should lead by example, demonstrating their commitment to ongoing transformation and encouraging others to embrace change.8.1 Leading by Example\n\nLeaders should actively participate in transformation initiatives, championing the importance of ongoing change and demonstrating the benefits through their actions. By showcasing their willingness to adapt and evolve, leaders inspire others to do the same.\n\n8.2 Communicating the Importance of Transformation\n\nEffective communication is essential in emphasising the significance of transformation during an economic downturn. Leaders should communicate the reasons behind ongoing transformation efforts, the potential benefits for the organisation's long-term stability, and the risks of inaction. Transparent and consistent communication builds employees' and stakeholders' understanding, alignment, and support.\n\n9. ConclusionIn conclusion, the continuation of transformation during an economic downturn is critical for the long-term stability of organisations. By embracing transformation, organisations can navigate the challenges of economic downturns, unlock new opportunities, and position themselves for long-term success. It's essential not to take the foot off the gas during these times and instead invest in innovation, agility, and adaptability. By adapting transformation goals, allocating resources wisely, fostering a culture of innovation, and overcoming obstacles, organisations can thrive and emerge stronger from economic downturns. Remember, transformation is not a one-time event but an ongoing journey that drives organisations' evolution and long-term stability.\n\nI would love to hear your thoughts if you have any feedback or comments on this article.

{"text": "Chapter 13 bankruptcy allows you to pay off your debt through restructuring by working with the courts and your creditors on a repayment plan. The repayment plan can last up to five years, and it's based on how much income you make and other financial factors. Chapter 13 allows you to keep all of your assets if you can successfully confirm an appropriate plan.\n\nBefore filing, it's helpful to know what Chapter 13 bankruptcy is, who it's for and how to qualify. We include an overview of the process as well as the pros and cons so you can decide if a Chapter 13 repayment plan is the right choice for you.\n\nWhat is Chapter 13 bankruptcy?\n\nChapter 13 bankruptcy is also known as a \"wage earner's plan\" because it's for individuals that have a regular source of income. Filing for Chapter 13 bankruptcy is an agreement you're making to repay your debts by breaking the debts down into manageable payments. Having a job or provable source of steady income assures the creditors and the court that you'll be able to make your payments.\n\nWhen you file for Chapter 13 bankruptcy, you're able to propose a repayment plan based on your income that will repay the debt within three to five years. The length of time to repay your debts depends on your specific circumstances as well as how much income you make. In order to be approved for the five-year repayment plan, you'll need to show to the court that there's a justifiable reason that you can't repay your debts within three years.\n\nThe Chapter 13 bankruptcy definition also states that once you file, it may stop foreclosure proceedings on your house. While you'll still need to make your regular mortgage payments, the bank may not be able to take your home.\n\nWho can declare Chapter 13 bankruptcy?\n\nYour eligibility for Chapter 13 bankruptcy depends on how much you owe in unsecured and secured debts. According to the United States courts, your unsecured debts must be less than $394,725, and your secured debts must be less than $1,184,200. It's also important to note that these amounts can adjust on a regular basis because they reflect the Consumer Price Index.\n\nNow, you may be wondering, \"What's the difference between unsecured and secured debts?\" Unsecured debts are typically debts like utility bills, medical bills, personal loans and money you've spent using credit cards. These unsecured debts are the ones included in your repayment plan and some of them may be eliminated at the end of your bankruptcy. Secured debts are related to things like your home or a vehicle loan.\n\nIn regard to business owners being eligible for Chapter 13 bankruptcy, you may qualify if you're self-employed or running an unincorporated business. If your business is set up as a corporation or partnership, you'll need to work with an attorney to find another form of bankruptcy that can work for your situation.\n\nChapter 13 bankruptcy qualifications\n\nQualifications for Chapter 13 bankruptcy are in place to ensure that you need to file in order to get back on your feet financially. The eligibility requirements also help the courts ensure that you're not in too much debt and are capable of making your regular payments in full and on time.\n\nRequirements include:\n\nYou must have a regular source of income\n\nSecured debts must be less than $1,184,200\n\nUnsecured debts must be less than $394,725\n\nYou must complete a credit counseling course\n\nHow does Chapter 13 bankruptcy work?\n\nThe Chapter 13 bankruptcy process can take time, so it is beneficial to know the process before you file. Here are the steps you'll take when filing.\n\nStep 1:Complete a credit counseling course\n\nBefore you start the Chapter 13 bankruptcy filing process, you must take a credit counseling course. This course must be taken through an approved agency within 180 days before filing. A list of approved credit counseling agencies can be found at the Department of Justice website.\n\nStep 2:Work with a bankruptcy attorney\n\nThere is quite a bit of paperwork involved when filing for Chapter 13 bankruptcy. While you can file on your own, you'll have far less to worry about when working with an attorney. When filing, there are laws you must comply with, and a bankruptcy lawyer can help ensure you're doing everything properly.\n\nStep 3:File a bankruptcy petition with the court\n\nOnce you're ready, you'll need to file a petition with a court. As soon as you do this, the court sends out what's called an \"automatic stay\" to your creditors. This is a court order stopping all calls, letters and other forms of communication from creditors trying to collect on your debts.\n\nStep 4:Submit a repayment plan\n\nNow, the ball is in your court, and you get to submit a repayment plan. This is your plan of action for how the creditors will be repaid. You'll work with your attorney to look at your income and expenses to see what type of payments you can afford to make. This repayment plan must be submitted within 14 days of filing your petition with the court.\n\nStep 5:Start making payments\n\nThe bankruptcy process can take months, but you must start with your repayment plan even if it has yet to be approved by the courts. Within 30 days of submitting your repayment plan, you can start making these payments.\n\nStep 6:Meet with a Chapter 13 trustee\n\nThe first time you'll have to physically go to court is to meet with a trustee. This is typically within three to seven weeks of filing your petition. The trustee will be reviewing your bankruptcy paperwork as well as meeting with your creditors.\n\nStep 7:Attend a confirmation hearing\n\nAfter the trustee meets with your creditors, you'll need to attend a hearing where the judge decides whether or not they're going to approve your repayment plan. If the payment plan is denied, depending on the reason, you may be able to try to file again. (In some jurisdictions you may not have to actually appear in person for this hearing if you use a streamlined process and get the trustee's permission to submit an order approving your plan beforehand.)\n\nStep 8:Continue making payments\n\nBy now, you're months into the process, and you should have been making payments regularly. If the judge approved your repayment plan, you'll continue to make these payments for the next three to five years, depending on the decision of the court.\n\nStep 9:Complete a debtor education course\n\nAt some point during this process, you'll also need to take a debtor education course. This is separate from the credit counseling class and also must be done through an approved agency.\n\nStep 10:Receive your discharge\n\nAfter three to five years of following your repayment plan and meeting any additional requirements from the court, your bankruptcy will be discharged. Also, keep in mind that although you're done paying, the bankruptcy can stay on your credit report for up to 10 years from the date of filing, but Chapter 13 is typically eight years from the date of filing.\n\nWhat happens if you can't afford the Chapter 13 repayment plan?\n\nFor individuals who can't afford a Chapter 13 repayment plan, you'll need to start looking at other forms of bankruptcy. In many cases where a person can't afford Chapter 13, they fall back to Chapter 7 bankruptcy.\n\nRemember, one of the main benefits of filing Chapter 13 bankruptcy is that you don't have to lose any assets. So, if possible, see what you can do to make the payment plan work.\n\nIf you begin looking at your financial situation and current income but realize you're not going to be able to commit to the Chapter 13 bankruptcy repayment plan, you're not alone. This is more common than you think and why working with a bankruptcy attorney is helpful. Through their experience and knowledge, they may be able to help you make Chapter 13 work for your situation.\n\nWays to make the Chapter 13 repayment plan work\n\nBefore giving up on Chapter 13 bankruptcy due to the belief that you won't be able to make your payments, there are some additional resources that may be able to help:\n\nTry debt consolidation: For a fee, debt consolidation firms work with your creditors to combine debts together so you only have to make a single monthly payment. For example, if you have three credit cards that you owe money on, a consolidation firm will work with the credit card companies to put all of those debts together.\n\nNegotiate a debt settlement: A great option is debt settlement. If you choose to go this route, you can save money by doing this on your own if you think you're able to negotiate with creditors. In some instances, creditors may be willing to settle a debt for a lower amount than what you owe.\n\nLook into a hardship discharge: You may also receive a \"hardship discharge\" from the court should you not be able to make your payments. This happens if the court deems you've fallen on hard times that were beyond your control and through no fault of your own, such as the loss of a job or an injury or illness.\n\nHow does a Chapter 13 bankruptcy repayment plan work?\n\nWhen you file your petition with the court, you're required to submit your payment plan within 14 days. Within the repayment plan, your debts will be split into various categories, such as secured, unsecured and priority claims. Priority claims must be paid in full, and these include taxes as well as fees for filing bankruptcy.\n\nDuring the filing process, you'll submit the following, which will help determine the approval of your payment plan:\n\nDetailed information including the amount, frequency and sources of your income\n\nA detailed list of your monthly living expenses such as housing, food, transportation, medical costs, etc.\n\nA list of all of your property\n\nA list of your creditors and the nature of their claims\n\nThis information will determine how much you'll be able to pay for the repayment plan. For secured debts that are guaranteed by collateral like car and home loans, you'll need to pay the amount overdue in order to keep the property. Secured debts are then paid with what you're making from your source of income after living expenses are taken into consideration.\n\nWhat's covered in Chapter 13 bankruptcy?\n\nShould your repayment plan be approved by the court, unsecured and secured debts may be covered by Chapter 13 bankruptcy. Once the trustee looks at your income and living expenses and talks with creditors as well, they'll make the final decision of what's covered. In order to better understand what's covered and what you're responsible for, it's helpful to know more details about unsecured and secured debts.\n\nUnsecured debts\n\nUnsecured debts may not have to be paid in full as long as you're able to make the payments based on your projected disposable income. The United States Courts classify disposable income as \"income (other than child support payments received by the debtor) less amounts reasonably necessary for the maintenance or support of the debtor or dependents and less charitable contributions up to 15% of the debtor's gross income.\"\n\nIn some cases, your unsecured debts may be reduced or even forgiven during the bankruptcy process. These types of debts include:\n\nCredit cards\n\nUtility bills\n\nMedical bills\n\nPrivate student loans\n\nPersonal loans\n\nSecured debts\n\nSecured debts are debts to mortgage holders or car lenders and the like that must be paid if you desire to retain the collateral. If you've put down collateral and are trying to keep your property, it's a good indication that this is a secured debt. Some examples include:\n\nAuto loans\n\nMortgage loans\n\nLife insurance loans\n\nSecured credit cards\n\nPawn shop loans\n\nHow much do you have to pay back in Chapter 13?\n\nFiling for Chapter 13 bankruptcy will eliminate some of your unsecured debts, but you'll need to pay off your secured debts. Secured debts that must be paid are typically debts from lenders or debts associated with taxes, child support or alimony.\n\nIn some cases, you may need to pay secured debts back in full. But with your repayment plan, you may have some flexibility on the total amount of the debt that you pay. In some cases, depending on the creditor and the deal they make with the trustee, some debts may be forgiven completely.\n\nWhat are the pros and cons of filing for Chapter 13 bankruptcy?\n\nChapter 13 bankruptcy can be a breath of fresh air because it allows you to make payments that fit within your budget. But it's important to keep in mind that there are downsides to any form of bankruptcy. Before you make the decision to file for bankruptcy, you should know both the pros and cons of filing because it can affect your financial future.\n\nWhat are the drawbacks to filing Chapter 13 bankruptcy?\n\nSome of the downsides to filing Chapter 13 bankruptcy to take into consideration include:\n\nDepending on how you look at it, spending the next three to five years paying off your debt can be a good or bad situation. Some people don't like the idea that they'll be paying debts for this length of time and would rather have the debts eliminated.\n\nWhat are the benefits of filing for Chapter 13 bankruptcy?\n\nAlthough there are some downsides to filing for Chapter 13 bankruptcy, the process is there to help. Here are some of the ways you may benefit from filing:\n\nYou may get to keep all of your property\n\nYou have the chance to get back in control of your debt\n\nThe process incentivizes financial responsibility\n\nThe required courses will teach you how to better manage your finances in the future\n\nYou can still get loans from certain lenders after your Chapter 13 is complete.\n\nWhat is the Chapter 13 bankruptcy court process like?\n\nWhen people ask \"What is Chapter 13 bankruptcy like?\" they often want to know if they'll have to go to court regularly. It's a common misconception that bankruptcy involves going in front of a judge regularly to discuss your case. In reality, you only go to court twice (if that), and much of the process is done outside of the courtroom.\n\nWhat is a Chapter 13 trustee?\n\nDuring the Chapter 13 bankruptcy process, you're assigned a trustee. The Chapter 13 trustee is a bankruptcy administrator whose job is to go through your financial statements and will also meet with your creditors. Ultimately, the trustee will be reviewing your case and will tell the court whether they believe you should be approved for Chapter 13 bankruptcy or not.\n\nWhat does an attorney do?\n\nA bankruptcy attorney is someone who focuses in bankruptcy law and can assist you throughout the process. Not only will your bankruptcy attorney help you collect and gather all of your financial information, but they'll also advise you throughout the process and will file the bankruptcy paperwork with the courts as well. While they do come at a cost, they're often worth it.\n\nWhat do you do when filing?\n\nWhen you're filing for Chapter 13 bankruptcy, your main job is to be as transparent and responsible as possible. Filing for Chapter 13 bankruptcy is telling the courts and your creditors that you're going to make your payments on time and in full. Should you choose to work with a bankruptcy lawyer, it's important to not hide anything and allow them to help you ensure the bankruptcy process is as smooth as possible.\n\nDo you need an attorney for Chapter 13 bankruptcy?\n\nIt's highly recommended that you work with an attorney throughout the bankruptcy process. As you've already learned thus far, a Chapter 13 bankruptcy can be detailed and sometimes complicated. While working with a bankruptcy attorney isn't mandatory, it's typically a good choice for the majority of people. Bankruptcy attorneys specialize in bankruptcy law, and they can help guide you through the process and try to ensure that you settle on a repayment plan that works for your situation.\n\nOne of the most important reasons for working with a bankruptcy lawyer is that they can help keep you out of trouble. Not disclosing certain assets or information during the bankruptcy process can be considered bankruptcy fraud, and it's a felony.\n\nAccording to Cornell Law School, nearly 70 percent of bankruptcy fraud involves not disclosing assets. By working with an attorney, you'll have someone there for you to help you make sure you don't miss anything during the filing process that could be seen as fraudulent.\n\nAlthough there are some key differences, there are some aspects of Chapter 7 and Chapter 13 bankruptcy that are similar. These similarities include:\n\nBoth forms of bankruptcy take months to complete the process through the court.\n\nDuring both Chapter 7 and Chapter 13 bankruptcy processes, you'll be assigned a trustee.\n\nYou can significantly benefit from working with a bankruptcy attorney when filing for either Chapter 7 or Chapter 13 bankruptcy.\n\nHow does Chapter 13 bankruptcy discharge work?\n\nIn order to receive a Chapter 13 bankruptcy discharge, you must make all of your scheduled payments for the three- to five-year duration. If you're required to pay other unsecured debts like child support or alimony, these payments must be made as well. Once discharged, the court will order that you're no longer responsible for the remaining balances of your secured debts.\n\nHow long does the Chapter 13 bankruptcy process take?\n\nFrom the time you initiate the process, you'll typically have an answer regarding your approval within about three months. This is another benefit of filing Chapter 13 bankruptcy vs. Chapter 7, because the Chapter 7 process can take twice as long. But once the court aspect of bankruptcy is complete, you'll make payments toward your debts for the following three to five years before you're discharged.\n\nHow long does Chapter 13 bankruptcy stay on credit reports?\n\nIf you're approved for Chapter 13 bankruptcy, the bankruptcy can stay on your credit reports for eight years after the petition was filed. During this time, it may be more difficult to buy a vehicle, a home or other purchases that involve a lender. Bankruptcy can affect your ability to get new credit cards as well. If you do need a loan during this time, you can research \"high-risk\" lenders, but keep in mind that they often loan with higher interest rates.\n\nRepairing your credit after Chapter 13 bankruptcy\n\nHaving to file for Chapter 13 bankruptcy is something that more people do than you may think. Once the process is over, it's time to think about repairing your credit to ensure that you have a solid foundation for a stable financial future.\n\nAt Lexington Law, we have professional consultants who are here to help you with our credit repair services.

{"text": "How The Latest Dietary Research Can Benefit Diabetics\n\nIn my earlier posts, I have stressed how important it is for people with type 1 or type 2 diabetes to follow a low glycaemic load (low GL) way of eating and to avoid sugar as far as possible. This is the basic dietary strategy for keeping your blood sugar levels stable, preventing or managing insulin resistance and reducing your reliance on insulin and diabetes drugs. Hippocratic Solutions will eliminate the need to consume drugs. The consumption of the solutions supplement is through excellence of the experts. Doctors and experts are sharing the information about it to have desired results.\n\nStudies have shown that including some specific foods can take this anti-diabetes diet a step further, due to their particular properties. Fish, nuts and red grapes all fall into this category, so are worth eating on a regular basis. Research at the University of Valencia that analysed dietary patterns in a Spanish adult population has found that fish appears to protect against the development of type 2 diabetes.\n\nGet your FREE 10 Diabetes Diet Secrets Special Report today Join our FREE Real Diabetes Truth e-alert and be the first to learn about urgent advances that will help you defeat diabetes… \"…please keep up the good work because what you say I now know to be very true. At last someone that knows what they're talking about, for a change. THANK YOU.\" – Roy Redfern We respect your privacy and will never share your details with anyone else. Your details will only be used to deliver your free report and to send you our bi-weekly e-alert, the Real Diabetes Truth.\n\nThe study aimed to understand current eating patterns in terms of meat and fish consumption and the correlation between the Mediterranean diet and cardiovascular risk factors. What the researchers discovered was that the Mediterranean population they looked at ate considerable amounts of both red meat and fish. But, while the consumption of red meat, especially cured meats, was related to increased weight gain and obesity, eating fish was associated with a lower prevalence of type 2 diabetes and lower blood glucose levels.\n\nIn itself, this study only shows an association and does not prove that fish reduces diabetes risk. It is likely, though, that eating a lot of fish leads to high levels of omega-3 fatty acids in the cells of the skeletal muscles.\n\nAccording to a recent study at the University of Cordoba, omega-3 fatty acids in muscle cells interact with genes controlling insulin sensitivity, so helping to reduce fasting glucose levels in people with metabolic syndrome. Nuts were also in the spotlight following research at the University of Toronto, Canada. In this study, patients with type 2 diabetes were asked to eat daily snacks of either muffins, a mixture of raw nuts (almonds, pistachios, walnuts, pecans, hazelnuts, peanuts, cashews, and macadamias) or a combination of muffins and nuts. Study participants eating the nuts-only snack reported the greatest improvement in blood glucose control and also experienced a reduction in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL, or \"bad cholesterol\"). Those eating the muffins or mixed muffin-and-nut snacks experienced no improvements in their blood sugar control. The two ounces of raw nuts a day used in this study pushed down HbA1c test readings (\"glycosylated haemoglobin\", an indicator of long term blood sugar control) significantly – in fact, not far off the reduction that would be recognized as clinically meaningful if this was a drug trial.\n\nNuts are likely to cause this effect in a similar way to fish, by increasing the amounts of unsaturated fatty acids in muscle cells, leading to better glucose uptake and consequently lower blood sugar levels. The third food, or in this case a food ingredient, that research has shown to help manage diabetes is resveratrol. Found most abundantly in the skins of red grapes, this is a natural polyphenol that plants produce to protect themselves from attack by bacteria and fungi. Resveratrol has been suspected for some time of having several beneficial health properties, but was recently under a cloud due to the discovery of some falsified results from a single researcher.\n\nRegrettable as this is, it highlights the importance of only relying on studies that have been independently verified by two or more respected institutions! Resveratrol has already shown promising effects on insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance in several animal studies, but now these have been confirmed in the first human clinical trial. This was a small, pilot study with ten people aged 69 to 75, diagnosed with impaired glucose tolerance (also called \"pre-diabetes\"), who were given a moderate dose supplement of resveratrol for four weeks. The results showed significant improvements in insulin sensitivity and reduced post-meal glucose levels.\n\nThe way that resveratrol appears to work in the body is by inhibiting certain enzymes known as phospho diesterases, that help regulate cell energy. In mice, at least, this has the effect of preventing diet-induced obesity, improving glucose tolerance and increasing physical endurance. To get more resveratrol into your diet, red grapes and red wine (in moderation!) are the best sources. It is also present in raisins, blueberries, raspberries, peanuts and pistachios. As a general guide, aim to eat fish (oily fish if possible) three times a week, have a handful of nuts every day and a glass of red wine, if you drink it, three or four days a week. The other sources of resveratrol mentioned above also make tasty and healthy snacks. Along with a low GL diet and regular exercise, this gives you some powerful tools for preventing and combating diabetes", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "7b64dfa3-908c-4e5e-8163-6a27ee8a1d03", "url": "http://journeytojah.com/how-the-latest-dietary-research-can-benefit-diabetics/"}

The method includes three rounds: General Exercise (GE), Personal Interview (PI), and Writing Ability Test (WAT). The GE round evaluates a candidate's communication, team-building, and leadership skills. The PI round assesses a candidate's personality, knowledge, and confidence.

Practice with friends, family, or mentors and simulate different interview scenarios. This will help you gain confidence, refine your answers, and handle stress effectively.\n\nBe Confident\n\nFinally, it's essential to believe in yourself and your abilities.

{"text": "Background and Aim: Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a prevalent neurodevelopmental disorder among children, adversely affecting various aspects such as learning abilities, interpersonal relationships, self-esteem, and emotions. Given the detrimental impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on children's mental health, this study aimed to assess the quality of life of 8 - 12 year-old children with ADHD during the pandemic. Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted on 54 children with ADHD referred to Kargarnejad Hospital in Kashan, Iran, in 2022. Data collection utilized a demographic questionnaire and the PedsQL quality of life questionnaire. Children were assessed in four functional subscales of quality of life: physical, emotional, social, and academic, along with a total score. Results: The mean age of the children was 9.15±1.43 years. The highest score was observed in physical performance, with a mean of 74.48±15.08, while the lowest score was in academic performance, with a mean of 53.33±15.17. A significant relationship was found between academic performance and gender (P=0.04). Conclusion: Both ADHD and COVID-19 contribute to a decline in children's quality of life, particularly impacting academic performance, which may lead to negative psychological consequences in their future years. Further research is recommended to explore treatment options for ADHD and address environmental and familial factors influencing the disorder.\n\n17. Klassen AF, Miller A, Fine S.

Following Ashoka's death and the decline of the Mauryas, Satavahana Simuka established the Satavahana dynasty, which came to include even the Magadha and Bengal at its height. The Satavahanas lasted for the next four hundred years after which the Pallavas and Eastern Chalukyas took control of the kingdom.\n\nVengi Chalukyas\n\nThe Eastern Chalukyas of the 7th and 8th century, were a branch of the Chalukyas of Badami. Pulakesin II, the renowned ruler of Chalukyas conquered Vengi (at a battle near Eluru) in 624 from Vishnukundinas and installed his brother Kubja Vishnuvardhana (624- 641) as its ruler. His dynasty, known as the Eastern Chalukyas, ruled for a century. Vishnuvardhana extended his dominions up to Srikakulam in the north and Nellore in the south. They had faced many wars for the next three centuries from Rashtrakutas and others. The Western Chalukya king Satyashraya tried to amalgamate the two dynasties, but was not successful due to the constant battles with the Paramaras and the Cholas.\n\nImperial Cholas\n\nTo counter the interference of the Western Chalukyas, Rajaraja Chola I supported Saktivarman I, an Eastern Chalukya prince who was in exile in the Chola country. He invaded Vengi in 999 CE to restore Saktivarman to the Eastern Chalukya throne by defeating and killing Telugu Chola king Jata Choda Bhima. Saktivarman finally got his throne back in 1002 CE and consented to recognise the overlordship of Rajaraja Chola I. Vengi Chalukyas remained as subordinate of Chola empire until Kulottunga Chola I took the complete overlordship of Vengi. Vengi was part of kingdom of Later Cholas during the 12th century. The Western Chalukyas under the king Vikramaditya VI occupied Vengi in 1118, but the Cholas under Vikrama Chola regained Vengi from Chalukya monarch Someshvara III in 1126–27 with the help of the Velanati Chodas of Tsandavolu. Vengi remained under Chola Empire for 2 centuries till Kulottunga Chola III's rule.\n\nLater kingdoms\n\nBetween 1135 and 1206, several other minor kingdoms ruled over parts of Andhra Pradesh accepting the authority of the Velanati Cholas. By 1208, Vengi was part of Kakatiya Empire as subordinates to Kakatiyas until their downfall in 1323. Later Vengi became part of the Vijayanagara Empire in the 16th century.\n\nLiterature\n\nVengi has occupied a prominent place in the history of Andhra Pradesh since the time of Eastern Chalukyas. They patronised Telugu. Since the time of the Eastern Chalukya Gunaga Vijayaditya, inscriptions show Telugu prose and poetry, culminating in the production of literary works.

{"text": "Global poll: America is the most hostile country in the world\n\nAnd The Country Posing The Greatest Threat to Peace as 2013 Ends is …\nDecember 31, 2013 - 1:03 AM\n\n(CNSNews.com) – The past year witnessed bloodshed in Syria and Iraq, turmoil in Egypt, anarchy in Central Africa, threats by a nuclear-armed North Korea and Chinese military posturing, but as 2013 ends a global poll finds that the country seen as representing the greatest threat to peace today is ... the United States.\n\nNot only did the U.S. top the list with an aggregate of 24 percent, but the runner-up threat country, Pakistan, was way behind at eight percent. China was third at six percent, followed by North Korea, Iran and Israel at five percent each.\n\nThe survey of opinions across 65 countries by pollster Win/Gallup International recorded some of the strongest anti-American sentiment, predictably, in countries widely regarded as rivals, led by Russia (where 54 percent of respondents said the U.S. was the greatest threat to peace) and China (49 percent).\n\nBut the view that the U.S. poses the greatest threat to peace was also strongly held in some purported U.S. allies – such as NATO partners Greece and Turkey (45 percent each), and Pakistan (44 percent), which is also a top recipient of U.S. aid.\n\nand don't think that this hostility we seem to show other countries doesn't affect the citizens and make them hostile towards one another too. people are not nice here\n\nI didn't really appreciate your comment until today. I thought about how long we've been at war and how many innocents died in Iraq and Afghanistan and how desensitized to it all we are now. We don't think of violence as anything abnormal, even when it involves the deaths of hundreds of thousands of people worldwide. We lost 2000 people in 9/11 and have probably killed one million since then smh......\n\nWorst is that we're so desensitized, we Americans think nothing of hurting and killing anyone else, including other Americans. It's hard to tell your fellow American violence isn't the answer when our govt perpetuates this all the time.\n\nalright, but let's be honest: this is kind of a bogus poll. it's more about criticizing the US than about saying who the actual greatest threat to peace is\n\nIt's really more about other nations' views on who they think is the biggest aggressor in the world now and sadly America came out on top. Otherwise, can we really disagree on the poll results?? I wouldv'e voted for Israel but considering America is the one giving Israel the bombs and bullets, I can't really say the poll is wrong.\n\nIt's really more about other nations' views on who they think is the biggest aggressor in the world now and sadly America came out on top.\n\nno, it's really not, because you're not polling heads of state, you're polling random dudes... and that's why the poll is more about criticizing the US than anything else\n\nalso, Israel may act ? but unless we're working on some fifth-dimensional chess level, their \"threat to peace\" is essentially localized\n\nSo what if they're polling random people? Isn't that how polls are done? Usually the polls are responsible and represent the wider population and CNSnews is known for being a great news source. Pakistan came in second with 8 percent, while America had 24% of the vote, despite the fact that the American population is 5% of the world, that should tell all of us somethingI understand the first two parts of the world but why is Haiti third? Haiti has one of the lowest murder rates in the Caribbean, if not the western hemisphere. And no way is Haiti more hostile a country then Israel or North Korea lolI love how these finger pointers had no issue using the NSA's data before Snowden gave them a platform to complain some more. I mean hey, America stomping through a country that harbored a ? that blew holes through our most sanctified buildings shouldn't get a response. I guess we shouldn't have seen WW2 to the end either and dropped the bomb on the ? . Unfortunately, Afghanistan was far more backwards then imperialist japan (which was fairly advanced with archaic methods) so it's taking longer, but it's not like we're out of Japan. I see no issue with helping to build a country up after you leveled it. It worked for Japan. Many actually do want us there unlike the Taliban who obviously want to continue subjugating women and blowing up buddhist statues. It's not like the pointless Iraq was ended. What other War is directly America involved in that it shouldn't be? I suppose Russias support of Syria makes them the good guys. Seems a bit more grey then thatpeople always skip over the part where....if any other country was in our spot they would do whatever they needed to do to protect their interests all over the world\n\nI find this poll troubling though, only because it gives ammunition to terrorists around the world who can easily point to this poll and say how widespread their anger is at America. And America supporting apartheid in Israel isn't something I consider protecting our interests. We mostly get hate and trillions in debt for our borderline evil foreign policy. This constant war mongering around the world isn't helping us pay down the debt that's for sure. If you mean protecting the interests of the corporate elite, then I'd agree with youthe chinese are hacking eerything an cant be stopped....they are overlooked.\n\nchina had 2mill people just to watch the internet...thats like everyone in philly watching what every one posts on hereamerica has done some evil things but america being the worlds most evil nation ever is a myth and it is spread by people who don't have a proper understanding of history. Do you know how many genocides the british empire committed ? or how many africans were systematically killed in belguim congo or how many innocents were slaughtered by imperial japan don't get me started in russia.\n\nheavy is the head that wears the crown but america wears it better than any other nation ever has\n\nWe are the paid enforcers of the world at this Point and China or Russia would love that top economic spot. If we keep approaching the rest of the world the way we do our own citizens we are gonna lose that spot. Why allow the expensive, hypocritical and pretentious to do what these other superpowers will do for cheaper with out the big facade.

{"text": "6 Tips to Save Your Furniture from Your Cat's Scratching\n\nCats are known for their love of scratching, but it can often be frustrating when they scratch up furniture, curtains, or anything they can get their claws on. However, it's important to understand that scratching is a natural behavior for cats, and it serves several purposes.\n\nIn this article, we'll explore the reasons why cats scratch and provide tips on how to prevent them from damaging your home.\n\nUnderstanding Why Cats Scratch\n\nFirst and foremost, scratching is a way for cats to keep their claws sharp and healthy. Just like humans need to trim their nails, cats need to scratch to keep their nails at a good length.\n\nScratching also helps cats exercise their muscles, especially in their front legs and shoulders. Additionally, cats use scratching as a form of grooming when they scratch, they remove the outer layer of their claws, which can help prevent infection.\n\nOn a more social level, scratching also serves communication purposes for cats. When they scratch, they leave behind visual and scent markings, which communicate messages to other cats.\n\nThese markings can serve as territorial boundaries, as a way to mark their presence, or as a way to communicate their mood or emotions. Lastly, cats also scratch as a way to initiate play or garner attention from their owners.\n\nPreventing and Redirecting Scratching Behavior\n\nNow that we understand why cats scratch, let's look at how we can prevent and redirect their behavior. 1.\n\nIntroducing Scratching Surfaces\n\nOne of the most effective ways to prevent damage to your home is by introducing scratching surfaces. Providing a designated scratching post or pad made of sisal, cardboard, or wood gives your cat a proper outlet for their scratching needs.\n\nIt's important to place the post or pad in a location that your cat uses frequently, such as near their sleeping area or their favorite window. Be patient and allow your cat time to explore and scratch their new post or pad.\n\n2. Varying the Materials and Textures\n\nWhile your cat may have a preference for a certain material or texture, it's important to provide a variety of surfaces to keep them interested in their scratching posts or pads.\n\nConsider using different types of materials such as carpet, sisal, corrugated cardboard, or wood. Experiment with different textures to see what your cat likes best.\n\n3. Covering up the Spot\n\nIf your cat continues to scratch in a specific spot, such as your furniture, try covering it up.\n\nUse a sisal scratching post or pad to cover the damaged area or place a thin mat or two-sided tape on the spot. This will discourage your cat from scratching in that area while also providing them with a good alternative.\n\n4. Infusing the Area with Scent\n\nAnother way to discourage your cat from scratching in certain areas of your home is by infusing the area with feline pheromones.\n\nPheromone plug-ins like Feliway can help reduce your cat's urge to scratch or mark their territory. Additionally, you can use friendly pheromones to create a positive association with their scratching post or pad.\n\n5. Addressing Anxiety and Stress\n\nEmotional stress can also contribute to your cat's scratching behavior.\n\nIf you've recently moved, brought in a new pet, or had a new child, your cat may be feeling anxious or stressed. It's important to reassure your cat and provide them with environmental changes that can ease their anxiety.\n\nGradually introduce them to new spaces or individuals to help them acclimate. 6.\n\nReducing Damage to Home\n\nTo minimize the damage caused by scratching, you can also trim your cat's claws regularly. Nail caps are also an option that can be put over your cat's claws to prevent damage to home.\n\nConclusion\n\nCats are natural scratchers, but with a little patience and effort, you can effectively redirect their scratching behavior while preventing damage to your home. Remember to provide a variety of scratching surfaces, infuse the area with scent, and address emotional stress.\n\nIncorporating these changes into your cat's daily routine will ensure they maintain healthy claw habits while keeping your home intact. Cats love to scratch, and this behavior serves several purposes, such as claw sharpening, grooming, and communication.\n\nTo prevent damage to your home, introduce scratching surfaces made of different textures, cover up damaged spots, infuse areas with feline pheromones, and address anxiety or stress. Trimming your cat's claws and using nail caps can also reduce damage.\n\nBy redirecting your cat's scratching behavior, your home will stay intact while maintaining your cat's healthy claw habits. Remember to be patient and experiment with different techniques until you find what works best for your feline.", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "9e294496-722a-4068-9316-aef3732c9f68", "url": "https://www.happysillycat.com/6-tips-to-save-your-furniture-from-your-cats-scratching/"}

{"text": "Buying Medications Online – Tips, Experiences, and the Affordable Option of Colchicine without a Prescription\n\nWho uses online pharmacies?\n\nThe convenience of online pharmacies has made them popular among a wide range of individuals. This includes those who do not have easy access to traditional brick-and-mortar pharmacies, such as individuals living in remote areas or those with mobility issues. Additionally, people who are unable to afford the high prices of medications at local pharmacies may turn to online pharmacies for more affordable options.\n\nBuying Medicines from Online Retailers\n\nWhen it comes to purchasing medicines from online retailers, it is crucial to exercise caution and ensure that the pharmacy you choose is reputable and reliable. With the proliferation of online pharmacies, it can be challenging to determine which ones are legitimate. Here are a few essential considerations to keep in mind:\n\n1. Check for Licensing and Certifications\n\nBefore making a purchase, always verify that the online pharmacy is properly licensed and certified. Reputable online pharmacies will prominently display their licensing information on their website. This certification ensures that they meet the necessary regulatory standards and adhere to best practices for dispensing medications.\n\nYou can also verify the pharmacy's credentials with regulatory bodies such as the National Association of Boards of Pharmacy (NABP) or the Pharmacy Checker Verification Program. These organizations provide a list of verified online pharmacies that meet stringent safety and quality standards.\n\n2. Read Reviews and Customer Feedback\n\nTo get a sense of the reputation and reliability of an online pharmacy, it is advisable to read reviews and customer feedback. Look for reviews on reputable platforms such as Trustpilot or Google reviews. Positive reviews and high ratings indicate that the online pharmacy has satisfied customers and has a track record of delivering quality products and services.\n\nHowever, be mindful of potential fake reviews or biased feedback. Take into account both positive and negative reviews, and consider the overall consensus before making a decision.\n\n3. Verify Prescription Requirements\n\nLegitimate online pharmacies will require a valid prescription for prescription medications. This requirement is essential to ensure that you receive the correct medication for your specific condition and dosage needs. Avoid online pharmacies that do not ask for a prescription, as they may be operating illegally or selling counterfeit medications.\n\nIf an online pharmacy provides the option to consult with a licensed pharmacist or healthcare professional, that is an additional indication of their commitment to patient safety and care.\n\n4. Research the Pharmacy's Reputation\n\nBefore making a purchase, it is always a good idea to do some research on the pharmacy's reputation. Look for information on their website, such as how long they have been in business, their contact information, and any accreditations or certifications they hold.\n\nYou can also search for news articles or consumer watchdog reports to see if the online pharmacy has been associated with any controversies or legal issues. Reputable online pharmacies should have a transparent and trustworthy online presence.\n\n5. Consider Prices and Payment Options\n\nWhile affordability is a significant factor for many individuals when choosing an online pharmacy, it is important to be cautious of extremely low prices. Unusually low prices may indicate counterfeit or substandard medications. Look for competitive prices that are in line with other reputable online pharmacies.\n\nPersonal Experiences with Buying Drugs from Online Pharmacies\n\nBuying drugs from online pharmacies can be a convenient and cost-effective option for many individuals. However, personal experiences with online pharmacies can vary. It is important to approach the process with caution and research reputable online pharmacies to minimize the risk of negative experiences.\n\nSome individuals may have positive experiences when buying drugs online. They may find the process to be convenient, as they can order medications from the comfort of their own homes and have them delivered to their doorstep. Online pharmacies often offer a range of services that set them apart from traditional brick-and-mortar pharmacies, such as free shipping, refill reminders, and access to specialized medications.\n\nHowever, others may encounter issues when buying drugs from online pharmacies. Some common concerns include delayed shipping, medication quality concerns, or difficulty in obtaining refunds or returns. It is essential to choose reputable online pharmacies that have good customer reviews and ratings to minimize these risks.\n\nOne important factor to consider when purchasing medications online is ensuring the pharmacy requires a valid prescription for prescription medications. Legitimate online pharmacies will always ask for a prescription from a healthcare professional to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the medication. This is important as improper use of medications can have serious health consequences.\n\nPersonal experiences with online pharmacies can be influenced by various factors. For example, the country of origin of the online pharmacy can play a role in the quality and legitimacy of the medications. It is recommended to choose online pharmacies that are based in countries that have strict regulations and oversight of the pharmaceutical industry.\n\nSurveys and statistical data can provide insights into the experiences of individuals who have purchased drugs from online pharmacies. For example, a survey conducted by Consumer Reports found that 21% of Americans who purchased medications online experienced shipping issues, 14% encountered problems with the quality of the medications, and 17% faced difficulties in obtaining refunds or returns. This highlights the importance of researching and choosing reputable online pharmacies to mitigate these risks.\n\nIn conclusion, personal experiences with buying drugs from online pharmacies can vary. While some individuals have positive experiences, others may encounter issues. It is crucial to research and choose reputable online pharmacies, ensure they require a valid prescription for prescription medications, and be cautious of potential risks. By doing so, individuals can benefit from the convenience and cost-effectiveness of online pharmacies while prioritizing their health and safety.\n\nBuying Medicines from Online Retailers\n\nWhen purchasing medicines from online retailers, it is important to be cautious and ensure that the pharmacy is reputable and reliable. Here are some key points to consider:\n\nCheck for proper licensing and certifications: Before making a purchase, verify that the online pharmacy has the necessary licenses and certifications to sell medications. This can help ensure that the pharmacy operates according to legal and ethical standards.\n\nLook for reviews and customer feedback: Read reviews and feedback from other customers to get an idea of their experiences with the online retailer. This can help determine the reliability and quality of the pharmacy's products and services.\n\nVerify prescription requirement: Legitimate online pharmacies will require a valid prescription for prescription medications. Avoid pharmacies that sell prescription drugs without a prescription, as this can be a sign of an illegal operation or counterfeit medications.\n\nPersonal Experiences with Online Pharmacies\n\nPersonal experiences with buying drugs from online pharmacies may vary. Some individuals may have positive experiences, finding the process convenient and cost-effective. However, others may encounter issues such as delayed shipping, medication quality concerns, or difficulty in obtaining refunds or returns. To minimize the risk of negative experiences, it is important to research and choose reputable online pharmacies.\n\nWhy People Choose Generic Products\n\nMany people choose generic products, including medications, because of the following reasons:\n\nAffordability: Generic medications are typically more affordable compared to brand-name options. This makes them accessible to individuals with lower wages or those without insurance coverage.\n\nSafety and effectiveness: Generic medications have the same active ingredients and undergo rigorous testing to ensure their safety and effectiveness. They are required to meet the same quality standards as brand-name medications.\n\nColchicine: Uses, Dosage, and Potential Side Effects\n\nColchicine is a medication commonly used to treat gout and other conditions. Here are some important points about colchicine:\n\nUses: Colchicine is primarily used to treat gout, a type of arthritis that causes sudden and severe joint pain. It can also be used to prevent gout attacks and treat familial Mediterranean fever.\n\nDosage: The appropriate dosage of colchicine can vary depending on the individual's condition and needs. It is important to consult with a healthcare professional who can provide personalized guidance. They will consider factors such as the severity of symptoms, medical history, and potential drug interactions.\n\nPotential side effects: Common side effects of colchicine may include gastrointestinal issues, such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Muscle pain and rare allergic reactions can also occur. It is important to seek medical attention if any severe or persistent side effects occur.\n\nUnique Services of Online Drugstores\n\nOnline drugstores often offer a range of services that differentiate them from traditional pharmacies. Some of these unique services include:\n\nFree shipping: Many online pharmacies offer free shipping, which can be convenient and cost-effective for customers.\n\nRefill reminders: Online pharmacies may provide automatic refill reminders to help individuals stay on track with their medication regimen.\n\nAccess to specialized medications: Online pharmacies may have a wider range of medications available, including rare or hard-to-find medications.\n\nConvenience: Ordering medications from the comfort of one's own home eliminates the need to visit a physical pharmacy, saving time and effort.\n\nEasy-to-use platforms and customer support: Online pharmacies often provide user-friendly platforms and customer support to assist customers with any questions or concerns they may have.\n\nFor those in need of affordable colchicine without a prescription, it is important to research and choose reputable online pharmacies.

{"text": "Which Battery is Best for an Electric Bike or Scooter?\n\nElectric scooters are becoming increasingly popular as alternative forms of transportation. These battery-powered vehicles are perfect for recreation and a great way to save gas on short, local trips. Keep reading to learn more about your replacement battery options, plus charging tips to help you get the best performance possible.\n\nWhat Kind of Battery Does an Electric Scooter Use?\n\nElectric scooters primarily run on three types of batteries: sealed lead acid, nickel metal hydride and lithium-ion. Each of these types differ in cost and life expectancy, which is measured in charge cycles. The number of charge cycles for a battery refers to how many times it can undergo the process of charging and discharging completely before it is no longer viable.\n\nSealed lead acid (SLA) batteries are the most common type of batteries used in electric scooters. Unlike the lead acid batteries used in many ATVs, boats and other applications, SLA batteries are completely sealed and spill proof. SLAs are the most affordable battery option, however, they also have the shortest life cycle of the three. If maintained properly, an SLA battery can last up to 300 charge cycles before it needs to be replaced.\n\nNickel metal hydride (NiMH) batteries offer the middle ground in terms of cost and life expectancy. If you're using a nickel metal hydride battery, you can expect it to last up to 500 charge cycles.\n\nLithium-ion batteries (LIB) are the most expensive of the three battery types but offer the longest possible life. A lithium-ion battery can last up to 1,000 charge cycles. They are also the lightest of the three battery types, which can help save energy while riding.\n\nBefore purchasing a replacement, be sure to check which types of batteries are compatible with your model scooter. You'll also want to determine what voltage you require, though most scooters run on 12-volt batteries.\n\nKeep Your Electric Scooter Battery Charged\n\nIt's important that you regularly charge your battery to help keep it maintained. Allowing your battery to discharge too low can shorten its life cycle. You'll also want to monitor the charging process to avoid overcharging, which can also have a negative impact on your battery. Another good rule is to avoid operating your scooter in temperatures below 32° F and above 113° F, as extreme temperatures put an enormous strain on batteries.\n\nMost scooters require that you use chargers made by the original manufacturers, however, we do offer a number of chargers for SLA batteries including the X2Power 3.8 Amp Charger and the X2Power 7.5 Amp Charger. The 3.8 model is compatible with 6V and 12V batteries, while the 7.5 charger works with 12V and 24V batteries. Both feature a recovery mode to save low voltage or sulfated batteries. Before purchasing a charger for your scooter, be sure to check your owner's manual or the brand website to make certain it is compatible with your brand and model.", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "a18ad5b2-1b72-42ce-89ae-c56a848bb23d", "url": "https://www.batteriesplus.com/blog/power/electric-bike-and-scooter-batteries"}
{"text": "Dogs and storms\n\nStorm season is upon us again and many of our dogs can find storms particularly scary… Dogs often break out of their yards and end up in the Council Pound, being picked up by strangers or worse yet being hit by cars during this time of the year.\n\nDogs' hearing is much more acute than ours and some dogs can be more prone to panic related disorders e.g. working breeds (Border Collies, Kelpies, Australian Cattle Dogs) as well as those that may already have other fearful behaviours like separation anxiety or chronic stress related to a medical condition. Dogs can have phobias to a variety of different noises or just specifically to storms.\n\nThere can be a number of factors that trigger storm phobia including: drop in barometric pressure, thunder, static electricity, lightening, humidity, rain and wind – or any combination of these.The triggers may be different for each dog and your dog may display a range of behaviours including hiding, trembling, salivating, dilated pupils, excessive panting and pacing. It's important to manage the environment and try to reduce the intensity of the phobia for the dog.Firstly, prepare a safe place for your dog during a storm – particularly for when you are not at home - like a shed or an undercover area. Ensure your fences are high and secure and place locks on your gates in case the gates get blown open in the wind. Dogs will often dig to get out of the yard when thunder is close so having concrete and/or chicken wire along fence-lines can be useful. Also ensure your dog is wearing a collar and name tag (or embroidered collar) with your telephone number as required by the Companion Animals Act 1998. Do not tie your dog up, he has to be able to move and get away from the stimuli. Next, ensure your dog is trained to respond to basic behaviours (sit, drop, stay, come) and can be directed to a place on cue. This can be important when you need him to respond under stressful conditions. Be proactive and download a CD of storm noises which you can play at a low volume so your dog gets used to these different noises at a young age before the storm season starts. Pair these noises with good treats and fun activities like playing with balls and toys or fun training. This will teach your dog that 'good things happen' when these triggers occur.If possible, give your dog a safe and comfortable place inside to lay e.g. a laundry, under your bed or in a dark open cupboard. Leave white noise on (TV or radio) or music to muffle the noise of the storm. Thunder shirts may also help by swaddling your dog and making him feel more secure  Calming pheromones like Adaptil Dog Appeasement Pheromone may also help  phobia can be severe and medication may be required for some dogs. Recovery time is important. You should consult with your Veterinarian if your dog doesn't recover quickly from a phobic incident and/or causes injury to himself. Untreated phobias will often worsen over time.Remember, dogs are all individuals and there is no 'one size fits all' – particularly when fear is concerned. Consult a behaviour specialist to work with you in need. Finally, it is ok to cuddle your dog and let him sit on your lap for comfort if you choose to do so! You can't reinforce anxiety by comforting a dog,\" according to Dr. Melissa Bain, an associate professor of clinical animal behavior at the University of California, Davis, School of Veterinary Medicine, \"You won't make the fear worse. Do what you need to do to help your dog.\"Have a great day, Toby x", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "d366f280-5911-466d-91b8-566b4fe810b9", "url": "https://www.thedoglady.com.au/post/dogs-and-storms"}

{"text": "Recent Articles\n\nAssociation rule mining is the process of determining conditional probabilities within events that contain items or characteristics. Events can range from tweets, to grocery store receipts, to credit card applications.\n\nItems within these events should also not be unique to each event. For example, words are repeated across tweets, multiple customers will buy the same items at the grocery store, and credit card applicants will share specific characterisitcs.\n\nFor all of these applications our goal is to estimate the probability that an event will possess item B given that it has item A. This probability is also called the confidence.\n\nIn the example above we might say that we are 23% confident that a customer will purchase rice (item B) given they are purchasing chicken (item A). We can use historical transactions (events) to estimate confidence.\n\nNow for a practical implementation using the tidyverse in R! I am using a groceries dataset from Georgia Tech. This dataset contains rows with items separated by commas.\n\nreceipt\n\ncitrus fruit, semi-finished bread\n\nready soups, margarine\n\nOne transaction per row with items comma separated.\n\nBecause each event contains different items I read it using readLines() and reshape into a longer format. The groceries column contains the item name while transaction contains the transaction ID.\n\nFor example, giving this function c(\"A\", \"B\", \"C\") would return c(\"A,B\" \"A,C\" \"B,C\" \"B,A\" \"C,A\" \"C,B\"). This is because we want to determine the probabilities of A given B and B given A.\n\nOur final function performs the data mining. The first argument called data takes in the data frame of events and items. The last two arguments item_col and event_id tell the function which columns refer to the items and the event identifier respectively.\n\nThis function works in two stages. First, it determines the count of all individual items in the data set. In the example with groceries, this might be the counts of transactions with rice, beans, etc.\n\ngroceries\n\nA Count\n\nbaking powder\n\n174\n\nberries\n\n327\n\nCounts of individual items serve as the denominator in the confidence computation.\n\nThe second stage uses the comb_vec() function to determine all valid item combinations within each group. This stage only returns valid combinations where the confidence is > 0%.\n\nFinally, the function left joins the item counts to the combination counts and computes the confidence values. I called the function and return the result. I am also filtering to only combinations with a confidence of 50% or more with items purchased more than 10 times.\n\nHere we can see the head of the results table ordered by confidence from highest to lowest. We observe that the confidence of honey and whole milk is 73%! In other words, 73% of the transactions that contain honey also contain whole milk.\n\nA\n\nB\n\nA B Count\n\nA Count\n\nConfidence\n\nhoney\n\nwhole milk\n\n11\n\n14\n\n0.733\n\nfrozen fruits\n\nother vegetables\n\n8\n\n12\n\n0.667\n\ncereals\n\nwhole milk\n\n36\n\n56\n\n0.643\n\nrice\n\nwhole milk\n\n46\n\n75\n\n0.613\n\nHead of results table.\n\nAssociation rule mining is a fairly simple and easy to interpret technique to help draw relationships between items and events in a data set.\n\nIn the 1970s, professor Robert May became interested in the relationship between complexity and stability in animal populations. He noted that even simple equations used to model populations over time can lead to chaotic outcomes. The most famous of these equations is as follows:\n\nxn+1 = rxn(1 – xn)\n\nxn is a number between 0 and 1 that refers to the ratio of the existing population to the maximum possible population. Additionally, r refers to a value between 0 and 4 which indicates the growth rate over time. xn is multiplied by the r value to simulate growth where (1 – xn) represents death in the population.\n\nLets assume a population of animals is at 50% of the maximum population for a given area. We would allow xn to be .5. Lets also assume a growth rate of 75% allowing r to be .75. After the value xn+1 is computed, we use that new value as the xn in the next iteration and continue to use an r value of .75. We can visualize how xn+1 changes over time.\n\nVisualizing the population with an r value of 50% and a starting population of 50%.\n\nWithin 20 iterations, the population dies off. Lets rerun the simulation with an r value greater than 1.\n\nVisualizing the population with an r value of 1.25 and a starting population of 50%.\n\nNotice how the population stabilizes at 20% of the area capacity. When the r value is higher than 3, the population with begin oscillating between multiple values.\n\nVisualizing the population with an r value of 3 and a starting population of 50%.\n\nVisualizing the population with an r value of 3.7 and a starting population of 50%.\n\nExtremely minor changes in the r value yield vastly different distributions of population oscillations. Rather than experiment with different r values, we can visualize the distribution of xn+1 values for a range of r values using the R programming language.\n\nLets start by building a function in R that returns the first 1000 iterations of xn+1 for a given r value.\n\nMin refers to the lower limit of r while the max refers to the upper limit. The function will return a dataframe of approximately 400,000 values referring to each of the 1000 iterations for the 400 r values between the lower and upper bound. The function returns all 400,000 values in less than a quarter of a second.\n\nWith the dataframe of values assembled, we can visualize the distribution of values using ggplot.\n\nVisualizing the distribution of 400 r values between 0 to 4 for 1000 iterations.\n\nNotice how r values of less than 1 indicate the population dies out. Between 1 and just under three, the population remains relatively stable. At around 3, the populations being oscillating between two points. Beyond an r of 3.54409, chaos ensues. It becomes extremely difficult to predict the value of xn+1 for a given iteration with an r value above 3.54409. So difficult, in fact, that this simple deterministic equation was used as an early random number generator.\n\nSo what are the practical applications for this? Representations of chaos (or systems that yield unpredictable results and are sensitive to starting conditions) can be seen across many industries and fields of study. In finance, for example, intra-day security prices have been described as a random walk – extremely difficult to predict. While long term outlooks may show seasonality, chaos theory can help model the extremely chaotic and unpredictable nature of stock prices the left of each cell.

{"text": "What is Investment Finance ?\n\nInvestment finance is the branch of finance that deals with the financing of investments. Including the purchase of assets such as stocks, bonds, real estate, and other investments.\n\nIt also involves the management of those investments to maximize their return. Investment finance is concerned with maximizing returns and minimizing risk through the careful selection and management of investment assets. It involves analyzing financial statements and market trends, valuing assets, and developing investment strategies. Investment finance is an important field for individuals, businesses, and financial institutions. As it allows them to grow their wealth and achieve their financial goals.\n\nImportance of investment finance\n\nInvestment finance is important for a number of reasons:\n\nWealth creation: Investment finance allows individuals and businesses to grow their wealth by earning returns on their investments. This can be particularly important for long-term financial planning. Such as saving for retirement or building a financial foundation for future generations.\n\nRisk management:\n\nInvestment finance can help to minimize risk by diversifying a portfolio across a range of assets and investment strategies. This can help to reduce the impact of market fluctuations on an individual's or business's financial position.\n\nFunding for businesses: Investment finance can provide businesses with the capital they need to grow and expand. For example, a company may issue stocks or bonds to raise money for new projects or acquisitions.\n\nEconomic growth:\n\nInvestment finance helps to allocate capital to its most productive uses, which can contribute to overall economic growth and development.\n\nFinancial security:\n\nProper investment planning can help to provide financial security and stability for individuals and businesses. It can also help to protect against inflation and other economic challenges.\n\nFinancial independence:\n\nInvestment finance can help individuals and businesses to achieve financial independence and freedom. For example, passive income from investments can provide a source of income that is not dependent on working for a salary.\n\nOpportunity for higher returns:\n\nBy investing in assets with the potential for higher returns, such as stocks or real estate, individuals and businesses can potentially earn more than they would from simply saving money in a low-interest savings account.\n\nAbility to achieve financial goals:\n\nInvestment finance can help individuals and businesses to achieve their financial goals, whether that means saving for a down payment on a home, either funding a child's education or creating a retirement fund\n\nProfessional expertise:\n\nWorking with a financial professional who is knowledgeable about investment finance can help individuals and businesses to make informed decisions and achieve their financial goals more effectively.\n\nSocial responsibility:\n\nInvestment finance can also be a way for individuals and businesses to use their financial resources for social good, through investments in socially responsible or impact investing strategies.\n\nInflation protection:\n\nInvestment finance can help to protect against inflation, which is the general increase in the price of goods and services over time. By investing in assets that have the potential to appreciate in value, individuals and businesses can potentially preserve the purchasing power of their money over the long term.\n\nAbility to leverage financial resources:\n\nInvestment finance can also allow individuals and businesses to leverage their financial resources by borrowing money to invest. For example, a real estate investor may use leverage to buy a property by taking out a mortgage, which can potentially increase their potential return on investment.\n\nGeneration of passive income:\n\nInvestment finance can also be a way to generate passive income, which is income that is earned without the need for active work. For example, an individual who owns rental property may receive regular rental income without having to actively manage the property themselves.\n\nPromotes financial literacy:\n\nBy educating themselves about investment finance, individuals and businesses can become more financially literate and be better able to make informed financial decisions.\n\nEnhances financial stability:\n\nProper investment planning and management can help to enhance financial stability and security for individuals and businesses, by providing a source of income that is not dependent on a single stream of income such as a salary.\n\nTypes of Investments\n\nStocks\n\nA stock, often called a share or equity, denotes a company's ownership. When you own a stock, you are a shareholder in the company and are entitled to a portion of the company's profits and assets. Stocks are often bought and sold on stock exchanges, such as the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) or the NASDAQ.\n\nCommon stock and preferred stock are the two major types of stocks. The most prevalent kind of stock, common stock, denotes ownership in a corporation. Holders of common stock have voting rights at shareholder meetings and may receive dividends, which are payments to shareholders out of the company's profits. Preferred stock is a type of stock that may have certain privileges over common stock, such as a higher claim on the company's assets or a fixed dividend.\n\nStocks can be a volatile investment, as their prices can fluctuate significantly due to a variety of factors such as changes in the company's financial performance, market conditions, and investor sentiment. However, stocks also have the potential for significant long-term growth, which makes them a popular choice for investors with a long-term investment horizon.\n\nBonds\n\nA bond is a type of financial instrument that acts as collateral for a loan that an investor makes to a borrower, usually a business or government. The borrower agrees to pay the investor a fixed rate of interest, known as the coupon rate, over a fixed period of time, and to repay the principal amount at the end of the loan term.\n\nBonds are typically considered to be less risky investments than stocks, as they offer a fixed rate of return and the borrower is typically required to make regular interest payments. However, bond prices can still fluctuate in response to changes in market conditions, such as changes in interest rates.\n\nBonds come in a variety of forms, such as corporate, municipal, and federal (government) bonds. Corporate bonds are issued by companies to raise capital, while municipal bonds are issued by local governments to finance public projects such as schools or highways. Government bonds, also known as treasuries, are issued by national governments to finance their operations.\n\nInvestors in bonds may receive regular interest payments and may also be able to sell their bonds before they mature, although the price they receive may be different from the original purchase price.\n\nMutual funds\n\nReal estate\n\nReal estate is a physical property, such as land or a building, that can be owned and used for investment purposes. Real estate investing can take many forms, such as the purchase of a rental property, the development of a new commercial building, or the renovation and flipping of a residential property.\n\nReal estate can be a lucrative investment, as it has the potential to generate income through rental payments or appreciation in value over time. However, it is also a significant financial commitment and carries its own set of risks, such as the possibility of property value declines, natural disasters, and tenant issues.\n\nThere are several factors to consider when evaluating a real estate investment, including location, property type, expected returns, and potential risks. It is important for investors to conduct thorough research and due diligence before making a real estate investment.\n\nReal estate can be a complex and illiquid asset, and it may require a significant amount of time and resources to manage.Therefore, it might not be appropriate for all investors. It is important to carefully evaluate one's own financial situation and investment goals before considering a real estate investment.\n\nAlternative investments are investment assets that fall outside of the traditional categories of stocks, bonds, and cash. They may include assets such as precious metals, commodities, hedge funds, and private equity.\n\nRisk tolerance and portfolio diversification\n\nRisk tolerance is an individual's willingness and ability to take on risk in pursuit of potential returns. It is an important consideration in investment planning, as it can help to determine an appropriate mix of assets for an investment portfolio.\n\nIndividuals with a high risk tolerance may be more willing to accept the potential for volatility in their investments in exchange for the potential for higher returns. On the other hand, individuals with a low risk tolerance may prefer investments that offer more stability and a lower potential for loss.\n\nPortfolio diversification is a strategy that involves spreading investments across a variety of asset classes and individual securities in order to reduce the overall risk of the portfolio. By diversifying, investors can potentially reduce the impact of volatility in any one asset or sector on their overall portfolio.\n\nFor example, an investor may choose to allocate a portion of their portfolio to stocks, a portion to bonds, and a portion to cash or other assets. This can help to reduce the overall risk of the portfolio, as the performance of one asset class may not have a significant impact on the overall portfolio if the other asset classes are performing differently.\n\nIt is important for investors to assess their own risk tolerance and to diversify their portfolios accordingly in order to manage risk and achieve their financial goals.\n\nPrecious metals, such as gold and silver, are often considered alternative investments due to their lack of correlation with other asset classes. They may be seen as a hedge against inflation and economic uncertainty, although their value can also be impacted by a variety of factors such as supply and demand.\n\nCommodities are physical goods that are traded on financial markets, such as oil, natural gas, and agricultural products. A wide range of variables, such as supply and demand, the environment, and geopolitical developments, can influence commodity prices.\n\nHedge funds are privately managed investment funds that use a variety of investment strategies, including leverage and short selling, to generate returns. They may be more risky and less transparent than other investments, and are generally only available to accredited investors.\n\nPrivate equity is an asset class that consists of ownership stakes in private companies that are not publicly traded on a stock exchange. Private equity investments may involve a longer time horizon and a higher level of risk compared to other investments.\n\nAlternative investments may carry a higher level of risk and may not be suitable for all investors. It is important to carefully evaluate one's own financial situation and investment goals before considering an alternative investment.\n\nFundamental analysis (e.g. financial statements, industry trends)\n\nFundamental analysis is a method of evaluating the intrinsic value of an investment by analyzing various financial and economic factors. It involves examining a company's financial statements, such as its income statement, balance sheet, and cash flow statement, in order to understand its financial health and performance.\n\nFundamental analysis also involves evaluating a company's industry and market conditions, as well as its management and competitive landscape. This can help to identify risks and opportunities that may not be reflected in the company's financial statements.\n\nBy performing fundamental analysis, investors can make informed decisions about the potential value of an investment and its risk profile. It is a common approach used by investors and analysts to assess the potential return on an investment.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that fundamental analysis is just one aspect of investment analysis, and that other factors such as technical analysis and market conditions may also impact the performance of an investment.\n\nTechnical analysis (e.g. chart patterns, moving averages)\n\nTechnical analysis is a method of evaluating investments by analyzing statistical trends gathered from trading activity, such as past prices and volume. It is based on the idea that market trends, as shown by charts and other technical indicators, can predict future activity.\n\nTechnical analysts use various tools and techniques to identify patterns and trends in financial markets. These may include chart patterns, such as head and shoulders or support and resistance levels, and indicators like moving averages and relative strength index.\n\nTechnical analysis can be used in conjunction with fundamental analysis, which involves evaluating a company's financial and economic fundamentals, in order to make investment decisions.\n\nWhile technical analysis can be a useful tool, it is important to note that it is not an exact science and that past performance is not necessarily indicative of future results. It is important for investors to consider a variety of factors when evaluating an investment, including both technical and fundamental analysis.\n\nValuation methods are techniques used to determine the value of an investment or asset. There are many different valuation methods that can be used, depending on the type of investment being evaluated. Some common valuation methods include:\n\nPrice-to-earnings ratio (P/E ratio): This is a commonly used valuation method for stocks that compares the price of a stock to its earnings per share. A high P/E ratio may indicate that the stock is overvalued, while a low P/E ratio may indicate that it is undervalued.\n\nDiscounted cash flow (DCF): This is a method of valuing an investment by estimating the future cash flows it is expected to generate and discounting them back to their present value. The present value is calculated using a discount rate, which reflects the time value of money and the risk associated with the investment.\n\nNet asset value (NAV): This is a method of valuing a mutual fund or other investment vehicle by dividing the value of its assets by the number of shares outstanding.\n\nComparable market analysis (CMA): This is a method of valuing a property by comparing it to similar properties that have recently sold in the same area.\n\nDividend discount model (DDM): This is a method of valuing a stock by estimating the present value of its future dividends.\n\nIt is important to note that different valuation methods may produce different results, and it is often helpful to use a combination of methods in order to get a more accurate valuation.\n\nPrice-to-book ratio (P/B ratio): This is a valuation method that compares the price of a stock to its book value, which is the value of a company's assets as reflected on its balance sheet.\n\nEarnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA): This is a measure of a company's profitability that excludes non-cash expenses such as depreciation and amortization. It is often used as a valuation metric, particularly for companies with significant intangible assets.\n\nIntrinsic value: This is the perceived or calculated value of an investment, based on a variety of factors such as financial statements, market conditions, and the investor's own expectations.\n\nPrice-to-sales ratio (P/S ratio): This is a valuation method that compares the price of a stock to its revenue per share. It is often used for companies that are not yet profitable or that have a high level of intangible assets.\n\nLiquidation value: This is the estimated value of a company's assets if they were sold off individually, rather than as a going concern. It is often used as a fallback valuation in cases where a company is in financial distress.\n\nMarket capitalization: This is a measure of the value of a company's outstanding stock, calculated by multiplying the stock's price by the number of shares outstanding. Market capitalization is often used to classify companies as small, medium, or large.\n\nPrice-to-free cash flow ratio (P/FCF): This is a valuation method that compares the price of a stock to its free cash flow, which is the cash a company generates after accounting for capital expenditures.\n\nPrice-to-earnings-to-growth ratio (PEG ratio): This is a valuation method that takes into account a company's earnings growth in addition to its P/E ratio. It is used to compare the potential growth of different investments.\n\nNet present value (NPV): This is a method of valuing an investment by calculating the present value of its expected cash flows, using a discount rate to account for the time value of money.\n\nReturn on investment (ROI): This is a measure of the profitability of an investment, calculated as the return generated divided by the cost of the investment. It is often used to compare the performance of different investments.\n\nEnterprise value (EV): This is a measure of a company's total value, including its debt and equity. It is determined as market capitalization less total cash and cash equivalents, plus debt, minority interest, and preferred shares.\n\nPrice-to-fair value ratio: This is a valuation method used by some investors to determine whether a stock is overvalued or undervalued based on its intrinsic value.\n\nEconomic value added (EVA): This is a measure of a company's financial performance that takes into account the cost of capital. It is calculated as the difference between a company's operating profit and its cost of capital.\n\nCapitalization rate (cap rate): This is a measure of the rate of return on a real estate investment, calculated as the property's net operating income divided by its purchase price or current market value.\n\nDividend yield: This is a measure of the annual return on a stock, calculated as the annual dividends per share divided by the stock price. It is often used to compare the relative attractiveness of different stocks.\n\nPrice-to-sales-to-growth ratio (PSG ratio): This is a valuation method that takes into account a company's sales growth in addition to its P/S ratio. It is used to compare the potential growth of different investments.\n\nPrice-to-book-to-growth ratio (PBG ratio): This is a valuation method that takes into account a company's book value growth in addition to its P/B ratio. It is used to compare the potential growth of different investments.\n\nPrice-to-earnings-to-dividend-growth ratio (PEDG ratio): This is a valuation method that takes into account a company's dividend growth in addition to its P/E ratio. It is used to compare the potential growth of different investments.\n\nValue-based management (VBM): This is a management approach that focuses on maximizing the value of a company for its shareholders. It involves setting value-based goals and using value-based metrics to track progress towards those goals.\n\nEarnings power value (EPV): This is a valuation method that estimates the present value of a company's future earnings, based on the assumption that the company will be able to maintain its current level of profitability indefinitely. It is often used to value companies with stable, predictable earnings.\n\nActive vs. passive investing\n\nActive investing involves making specific investment decisions, such as selecting individual stocks or bonds, with the goal of outperforming a benchmark index or the overall market. Active investors typically rely on research, analysis, and their own judgment to make investment decisions, and they may make frequent trades in an effort to achieve their investment objectives.\n\nPassive investing, on the other hand, involves tracking the performance of a benchmark index or investment strategy and making investment decisions based on that benchmark. Passive investors typically hold a diversified portfolio of securities that reflects the composition of the benchmark, and they may make fewer trades than active investors.\n\nBoth aggressive and passive investing have advantages and disadvantage. Active investing may offer the potential for higher returns, but it also carries the risk of under performing the market or incurring higher transaction costs due to frequent trading. Passive investing, on the other hand, may offer the potential for lower costs and more diversification, but it may also result in returns that are similar to the overall market.\n\nIt is important for investors to consider their own financial goals, risk tolerance, and investment horizon when deciding between active and passive investing.\n\nDollar-cost averaging\n\nDollar-cost averaging is an investment strategy that involves investing a fixed amount of money at regular intervals, regardless of the price of the investment. The goal of dollar-cost averaging is to reduce the impact of volatility on the overall cost of an investment by spreading the purchases out over time.\n\nFor example, an investor might choose to invest $100 per month in a mutual fund. If the price of the mutual fund is $50 per share when the first investment is made, the investor would receive two shares. If the price of the mutual fund increases to $60 per share the next month, the investor would receive fewer shares. If the price decreases to $40 per share, the investor would receive more shares. Over time, the average cost per share of the mutual fund will be the average of all the purchase prices.\n\nDollar-cost averaging can be a useful strategy for investors who are uncertain about the direction of the market or who want to reduce the risk of making a large investment all at once. However, it is important to note that dollar-cost averaging does not guarantee a profit or protect against loss, and it may result in lower returns if the overall trend of the market is upward.\n\nAsset allocation\n\nAsset allocation is the process of dividing an investment portfolio among different asset categories, such as stocks, bonds, and cash. The goal of asset allocation is to diversify the portfolio and manage risk by investing in a mix of assets that has the potential to provide a balance of return and stability.\n\nDifferent asset categories may have different levels of risk and potential return, and asset allocation can be used to adjust the balance of these factors in a portfolio. For example, stocks may have the potential for higher returns but also higher volatility, while bonds may have lower returns but also lower volatility. By allocating a portion of a portfolio to each asset category, an investor can potentially achieve a balance of risk and return that is suitable for their investment objectives.\n\nAsset allocation is an important aspect of investment planning, as it can have a significant impact on the overall risk and return profile of a portfolio. It is important for investors to consider their own financial goals, risk tolerance, and investment horizon when determining an appropriate asset allocation.\n\nRebalancing: This is the process of adjusting the asset allocation of a portfolio to maintain the desired balance of risk and return. It may involve selling assets that have appreciated in value and using the proceeds to purchase underweighted assets.\n\nTarget-date funds: These are mutual funds that automatically adjust the asset allocation of a portfolio as the investor approaches a target retirement date. The asset allocation becomes more conservative as the target date approaches, typically shifting from a higher proportion of stocks to a higher proportion of bonds.\n\nStrategic asset allocation: This is a long-term asset allocation strategy that is based on an investor's financial goals and risk tolerance. It involves choosing a mix of assets that is expected to provide the best combination of risk and return over the long term.\n\nTactical asset allocation: This is a short-term asset allocation strategy that involves making adjustments to the asset mix of a portfolio based on the investor's view of market conditions. It may involve taking a more active approach to asset allocation in an effort to take advantage of market opportunities or to manage risk.\n\nAsset location: This is the process of deciding which types of assets to hold in taxable accounts and which to hold in tax-advantaged accounts, such as 401(k)s or IRAs. The goal of asset location is to maximize the tax efficiency of an investment portfolio.\n\nPortfolio rebalancing\n\nPortfolio rebalancing is the process of adjusting the asset allocation of an investment portfolio in order to maintain the desired balance of risk and return. This may involve selling assets that have appreciated in value and using the proceeds to purchase underweighted assets, or vice versa.\n\nThere are several reasons why an investor might choose to rebalance their portfolio:\n\nTo maintain the desired asset allocation: Over time, the performance of different assets in a portfolio may cause the asset mix to drift from the original allocation. Rebalancing allows the investor to bring the portfolio back to its target allocation.\n\nTo manage risk: By rebalancing, an investor can potentially reduce the risk of the portfolio by selling assets that have become too risky or have become a larger portion of the portfolio than intended.\n\nTo take advantage of market conditions: An investor may choose to rebalance their portfolio in order to take advantage of market opportunities or to position the portfolio for a potential change in market conditions.\n\nIt is important for investors to carefully consider their financial goals, risk tolerance, and investment horizon when deciding whether and how to rebalance their portfolio.\n\nTax considerations\n\nTax considerations can be an important factor in investment planning and decision making. There are several types of taxes that may be applicable to investments, including:\n\nIncome taxes: Investment income, such as dividends and interest, may be subject to federal and state income taxes. The tax rate on investment income may depend on the investor's tax bracket and the type of investment.\n\nCapital gains taxes: When an investor sells an asset for a profit, the profit may be subject to capital gains taxes. The tax rate on capital gains may depend on the holding period of the asset and the investor's tax bracket.\n\nEstate taxes: Investments may be subject to estate taxes when they are transferred to heirs upon the investor's death. The estate tax rate and exemption level may vary depending on federal and state laws.\n\nProperty taxes: Real estate investments may be subject to property taxes, which are usually based on the value of the property.\n\nSales taxes: Some investments, such as mutual funds and exchange-traded funds, may be subject to sales taxes when they are purchased or sold.\n\nIt is important for investors to be aware of the tax implications of their investments and to consider them when making investment decisions. Seeking the advice of a financial advisor or tax professional may be helpful in this regard.\n\nInvestment fees and expenses\n\nInvestment fees and expenses are costs that are associated with investing and can reduce the return on an investment. Some common types of investment fees and expenses include:\n\nManagement fees: Many investment products, such as mutual funds and exchange-traded funds, charge a management fee to cover the costs of operating the investment. These fees are usually expressed as a percentage of the investment's net asset value.\n\nTrading costs: When an investor buys or sells an investment, there may be costs associated with executing the trade. These may include brokerage commissions and other fees.\n\nAdvisory fees: Some investors may choose to work with a financial advisor who charges a fee for their services. These fees may be based on a percentage of the assets being managed or on an hourly or flat rate basis.\n\nPerformance fees: Some investment products, such as hedge funds and private equity funds, may charge a performance fee based on the investment's return. These fees are usually expressed as a percentage of the investment's profits.\n\nExpense ratios: Many mutual funds and exchange-traded funds have an expense ratio, which is the annual fee that the fund charges to cover its operating expenses.\n\nIt is important for investors to be aware of the fees and expenses associated with their investments, as they can have a significant impact on the investment's return. Investors should carefully review the fee disclosures of any investment product before making a decision to invest.\n\n12b-1 fees: These are fees that some mutual funds charge to cover the costs of marketing and distribution. They are usually expressed as a percentage of the fund's average net assets and may be paid out of the fund's assets or as a separate charge to investors.\n\nRedemption fees: Some mutual funds and exchange-traded funds charge a fee when investors sell their shares, known as a redemption fee or a back-end load. These fees are usually expressed as a percentage of the amount being redeemed and may decrease over time.\n\nAccount maintenance fees: Some brokerage firms and other financial institutions charge fees to cover the cost of maintaining an investment account. These fees may be assessed on a monthly or annual basis and may be waived if the investor meets certain criteria, such as maintaining a minimum balance or making a certain number of trades.\n\nSwitching fees: Some mutual funds charge a fee when investors transfer their assets from one fund to another within the same fund family. These fees are also known as \"exchange\" or \"transfer\" fees.\n\nLoads: Some mutual funds charge a sales commission, known as a load, when investors buy or sell their shares. Loads are usually expressed as a percentage of the amount being invested and may be charged as a front-end load, back-end load, or level load.\n\nHere is a summary of some key points related to investment finance:\n\nInvestment finance is the process of planning, acquiring, and managing financial resources in order to achieve specific investment objectives.\n\nDifferent types of investments, such as stocks, bonds, mutual funds, real estate, and alternative investments, have different risk and return profiles and may be suitable for different investment objectives.\n\nRisk tolerance and portfolio diversification are important considerations in investment planning, as they can help manage the risk of potential losses.\n\nThere are various methods for valuing investments, including fundamental analysis, technical analysis, and various ratios and metrics.\n\nActive and passive investing are different approaches to making investment decisions, with active investing involving more frequent trading and analysis and passive investing involving a more hands-off approach.\n\nDollar-cost averaging is an investment strategy that involves investing a fixed amount of money at regular intervals, regardless of the price of the investment.\n\nAsset allocation is the process of dividing an investment portfolio among different asset categories in order to achieve a balance of risk and return.\n\nPortfolio rebalancing is the process of adjusting the asset allocation of a portfolio to maintain the desired balance of risk and return.\n\nTax considerations and investment fees and expenses can have a significant impact on the return on an investment and should be carefully considered when making investment decisions.\n\nImportance of ongoing education and research in investment finance\n\nOngoing education and research are important in the field of investment finance, as the financial markets and industry are constantly evolving. Staying up-to-date with the latest developments and trends can help investors make informed decisions and manage their portfolios effectively.\n\nHere are a few reasons why ongoing education and research are important in investment finance:\n\nTo gain a better understanding of the financial markets and how they work: Ongoing education and research can help investors better understand the factors that can affect the performance of different types of investments, such as economic conditions, company fundamentals, and market trends.\n\nTo stay informed about changes in regulations and industry practices: The financial industry is subject to various regulations and rules, and these can change over time. Staying informed about these changes can help investors understand the implications for their investments and make informed decisions.\n\nTo identify investment opportunities and risks: Ongoing education and research can help investors identify potential investment opportunities and assess the risks associated with different investments. This can be particularly important in times of market uncertainty or when new products or strategies are introduced.\n\nTo improve investment performance: By staying up-to-date with the latest developments in the financial markets and industry, investors can potentially improve their investment performance and achieve their financial goals more effectively.\n\nOverall, ongoing education and research are important for investors of all levels of experience and can help them make informed and effective investment decisions.\n\nTo keep up with personal financial goals and objectives: Ongoing education and research can help investors stay focused on their personal financial goals and objectives, such as saving for retirement, building wealth, or protecting against loss. This can be particularly important as an investor's financial circumstances and goals may change over time.\n\nTo understand the risks and limitations of different investment products and strategies: Investment products and strategies can vary significantly in terms of their risk profile, potential return, and suitability for different investors. Ongoing education and research can help investors understand the risks and limitations of different investment options and make informed decisions.\n\nTo choose appropriate investment professionals: Working with a financial advisor or other investment professional can be an important aspect of investment planning. Ongoing education and research can help investors choose advisors who have the expertise and experience to help them achieve their financial goals.\n\nTo stay current with industry best practices: Investment practices and strategies can evolve over time, and staying current with industry best practices can help investors stay ahead of the curve. This may involve staying up-to-date with the latest research, attending industry conferences and seminars, or participating in professional development opportunities.\n\nTo be able to adapt to changing market conditions: The financial markets can be unpredictable, and ongoing education and research can help investors stay abreast of changing market conditions and adjust their investment strategy as needed. This may involve keeping an eye on economic indicators, industry trends, and other factors that can affect the performance of different investments.\n\nTo avoid common mistakes and pitfalls: Ongoing education and research can help investors avoid common mistakes and pitfalls, such as letting emotions drive investment decisions, overpaying for investments, or failing to diversify their portfolio.\n\nTo make better informed financial decisions: In addition to investment decisions, ongoing education and research can help investors make better informed decisions about other financial matters, such as planning for retirement, managing debt, or protecting against financial risks.\n\nTo stay up-to-date with the latest technological tools and resources: The financial industry is increasingly relying on technology to facilitate investment decision making and portfolio management. Ongoing education and research can help investors stay up-to-date with the latest technological tools and resources and make the most of them", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "2d2585a4-6de8-4a4c-bb2b-556056a49b38", "url": "https://uqueryme.com/investment-finance/"}

{"text": "Japanese Philosophies for Spending Money\n\nThis week, I have learned a few Japanese words that might stick with our crew as we spend money. Below is an article explaining all these words in more detail, but here are my takeaways:\n\nChisoku—Be content with what you have. And if you are reading this, you have enough. Read Enough Already\n\nWabi Sabi—Finding beauty in imperfection. Today, be present, find beauty in simple things. As you know, I look for and find beauty in sunrises. You can go here to see some of my sunrises and names I have for them.\n\nMitate—Every object has more than one purpose. I learned this backpacking. Yes, they make small backpacking cheese graters. No, I don't own one. I have a knife. Everything I carry on my back weighs something, so I an constantly paring down what I carry.\n\nMaybe work on one of these words this week.\n\nArigato,\n\nRule #11 from my book The Fantastic Life: The Growth Paradigm Take control over your growth. Learn, expand your mind, and experience new things. It's the only way to move forward.\n\nJapanese Philosophies That'll Help You Spend Money Consciously\n\nBy Rahul Chowdhury | Published August 9, 2021\n\nWhen you hear the word Japan, what comes to your mind?\n\nTorii gates? Mt. Fuji? The hustle and bustle of Tokyo city?\n\nBut:\n\nApart from Torii gates, Mt. Fuji and Shinto shrines, Japan is also famous for its life-changing wisdom.\n\nWhile Japanese wisdom touches every area of our lives, in this post, I'll talk about the philosophies that have been helping me keep overspending in check.\n\nLet's start with:\n\nChisoku\n\nChisoku talks about being content with what you already have.\n\nWe often end up buying more things than necessary because we either get sold on clever marketing or get caught up in temptation.\n\nI had such a temptation this morning when I went to the supermarket.\n\nWandering near the kitchen section, a rack full of vibrant pastel coloured cups caught my attention.\n\nWildly tempted, I gravitated towards picking up a dozen of them to liven up our kitchen.\n\nBut then, I had a Chisoku moment. I remembered that we already have more than enough cups at our home than we ever need.\n\nEven if we host a tea party of twenty people, we won't be running out of cups.\n\nWith this realisation, I bought only the items I came to the supermarket for, leaving the cups in their original place.\n\nAnd this has been a long-standing problem that I'm trying to fight.\n\nWhen it comes to home decor, my wife and I go crazy when we see minimalistic designs.\n\nOur home is stuffed with decor pieces.\n\nWe don't need more things unless something breaks or wears out and we have to replace them.\n\nThe problem is:\n\nNeed is limited, but want can be infinite.\n\nHere's another example:\n\nWhen browsing through the IKEA online store a couple of weeks back, we were on the verge of ordering a new floor lamp because it looked so good.\n\nAfter much contemplation, thankfully, we closed the browser tab without placing an order.\n\nWe don't need a new floor lamp. Buying that floor lamp would've been a wasteful expense and would've cluttered our living room.\n\nIn these situations, remembering the philosophy of Chisoku helps cut down unnecessary spending", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "06c74668-de17-4b90-a93b-d002585daa61", "url": "https://thefantasticlife.com/2022/03/28/japanese-philosophies-for-spending-money/"}
{"text": "NYC Plover Project\n\nA fledgling Piping Plover with the Lower Manhattan skyline in the background. Photo by Benjamin Forbes.\n\nOn the ocean and bay beaches of Queens, New York City, volunteers with the NYC Plover Project wear light blue T-shirts featuring a simplified line drawing of a Piping Plover, the tiny, sand-colored, endangered shorebird. The shirts—and the birds—look cute, but make no mistake: the conservation need for these birds is urgent, and the group is fiercely committed to protecting them. \"We're an army of plover protectors,\" says Chris Allieri, who started the group in 2021 after learning about the grave threats these birds face on city beaches where they lay their eggs and raise their young. In just three years, the NYC Plover Project has grown its corps of beach-patrolling volunteers to over 200 people, won grants to hire a growing staff overseeing education, community and volunteer efforts, and received an award from the National Park Service (NPS) and National Park Foundation as the national volunteer group of the year.\n\nNYC Piping Plover volunteers walk the beach, sit by beach closures, and talk to people about the various threats these birds face, not only from human disturbances but also habitat loss, predators, and climate change. Photo by Chris Allieri.\n\nLast year was the 50th anniversary of the Endangered Species Act, one of the most effective wildlife protection laws in the world, and the Piping Plover has been listed on it since 1986. There are three nesting populations: one on the alkali lakes of the northern Great Plains, one on the shores of the Great Lakes and one on the beaches of the Atlantic coast. Around the turn of the last century, hunting plundered their numbers. Before they could stage much of a recovery, widespread development along the Atlantic coast for real estate and recreation robbed them of their required breeding habitat. Roughly 6,000 - 8,000 individuals remain, according to the federal government, with about 50 pairs of the Atlantic population that attempt to breed on a patchwork of federal, city and private beaches of the Rockaway Peninsula in Queens, New York City.\n\nThis was news to Allieri until the early spring days of the COVID-19 pandemic, in 2020, when, like many New Yorkers, he took to birding in city parks to escape the grip of lockdown. At Fort Tilden, a popular federally-managed beach and former military base, he saw Piping Plovers for the first time since he'd seen one as a seven or eight-year-old, four decades earlier, through a scope outside his family's home on the southern Jersey Shore. The situation there was different—the plovers had miles of off-limits beach to roam—whereas at Fort Tilden, they seemed harried on all sides. He watched off-leash dogs chasing plovers, kids climbing the dunes, and people flying kites and drones. The nesting season had officially started, and male Piping Plovers sought to claim nesting territories amidst the dunes. He saw no protection for the birds. How could they survive?\n\nPiping Plover chicks must forage for themselves along the shore. This tiny chick braves the crowds at Fort Tilden beach, Queens, NYC. Photo by Chris Allieri.\n\nHe returned the following spring and watched a similar scene unfold, and his frustration moved him to act. An environmental organizer since high school, he had started a public-relations firm in 2016 to work with climate tech startups. He decided to create a citizen-led effort to protect those Piping Plovers, calling it the NYC Plover Project. The organization partnered with the National Park Service. That first summer, in 2021, 35 volunteers joined the effort. It has grown exponentially since then, with volunteers from all over the city, and a following of close to 18,000 people on Instagram. The group is now entering its fourth year of partnership with NPS and its second with NYC Parks & Recreation.\n\nThe Piping Plover is the only federally listed protected shorebird species under the Endangered Species Act to breed in New York City. As beach-nesting birds, they require constant vigilance, and their reproductive success has never been very good in the city. A Piping Plover clutch is usually four eggs, and the federal productivity recovery goal, as required by the Endangered Species Act, is 1.5 fledglings per pair. In New York City in 2022, the rate was 0.2 per pair. It was the worst breeding season ever recorded in the city. The greatest success has come in New England, on the Maine and Massachusetts coast, but those places don't suffer from the conservation challenges of a city of eight and a half million people. While 2023 saw some positive improvements along some of NYC's beaches, there is much more work to be done.\n\nExtreme though it may seem, the situation in New York is a microcosm of why the Piping Plover is an imperiled species.\n\nLike most shorebirds, Piping Plovers are ground nesters, laying their eggs in little scrapes on the sand directly on the broad part of the beach. The eggs are camouflaged to blend into the sand, but this strategy becomes less effective with a lot of beachgoers around—it's easy to inadvertently trample a nest. What makes Piping Plovers more vulnerable than other beach-nesting birds is that their chicks are precocial, meaning that the young must feed themselves. After hatching, the tiny chicks, which weigh less than two garlic cloves, stand on little toothpick legs and begin foraging. There is a lot of parental care, but it doesn't extend to feeding. And since the water's edge is where the high-quality marine food lies, the young need access to it for at least a month if they are to fledge and survive. Thus, to adequately protect Piping Plover families, the beach must be closed all the way to the water's edge.\n\nIt's a reality that oftentimes doesn't sit well with New Yorkers, who don't expect to share a city beach. Since its founding, the Plover Project's volunteers now sit at those closures, walk the beaches, talk to people, and, in rare instances, call U.S. Park Police when there are direct threats to the birds. In the last few years alone, eggs have been stolen and nests vandalized on NYC Parks' beaches, which are federal crimes. Across all beaches, several of the diminutive chicks have been stepped on by unwary beachgoers. Other threats loom: nocturnal predators, such as racoons and feral cats, prey on eggs and chicks, and the erosion of beaches due to rising sea levels. Compared to other beach-nesting birds on the Atlantic coast, Piping Plovers are relatively short-lived, so the birds that fledge and survive their first migration and first winter, along the Gulf coast or in the Caribbean, only have on average five years to reproduce and thus replace themselves.\n\nA Piping Plover family. Photo by Benjamin Forbes.\n\nWhich leaves the work of the NYC Plover Project all the more important. \"It's a dire situation,\" says Allieri. \"We're not just going to set up a table and tell people to share the shore. This is hands-on work, and it's the hardest thing I've ever done in my life. I'm inspired by the commitment of our volunteers and the support we receive from many New Yorkers, most of whom have never heard about the plight of Piping Plovers until they meet us.\"\n\nThis season, the first male Piping Plovers returned in the middle of March, soon followed by the females, and volunteers are already back on the beach, watching their courtship routines, and hoping that, come summertime, beachgoers recognize the importance of protecting this special bird.\n\n\"They're worth it,\" Allieri tells new volunteers. \"They're worth all the work; the frustration, the setbacks, the flies, the hot weather.\"\n\nAnd we agree.\n\nAn adult Piping Plover nicknamed Clark Kent, who has nested on NYC beaches for at least four years.

This requires a lot of resources and manpower, which adds to the cost of the software.\n\nLicensing and Copyrights\n\nThe software used in Photoshop and Illustrator are licensed and copyrighted, which means that Adobe has to pay licensing fees to their respective owners. Moreover, Adobe also has to protect its own intellectual property, which requires additional resources and legal fees.\n\nMarketing and Advertising\n\nAdobe has to invest in marketing and advertising to promote its software and reach its target audience. This includes creating promotional materials, attending trade shows and events, and advertising in various media. All of these activities require significant financial resources, which are reflected in the final cost of the product.\n\nBuy Photoshop Permanently: Your Guide to Adobe's Licensing Options\n\nAdobe Photoshop has been a popular tool for designers, photographers, and artists for years. If you're looking to buy Photoshop permanently, there are a few licensing options available from Adobe that you should be aware of.\n\nPhotoshop CC\n\nPhotoshop CC is Adobe's flagship image editing software. It's available through a subscription model, which means you pay a monthly or annual fee to use the software. With a subscription, you get access to the latest version of Photoshop and other Adobe products, as well as regular updates and new features.\n\nPhotoshop Elements\n\nPhotoshop Elements is a more affordable option for those who don't need all the features of Photoshop CC. It's a one-time purchase, which means you pay for it once and own it forever. Elements is a scaled-down version of Photoshop, but it still offers a wide range of tools for photo editing and design.\n\nPhotoshop Lightroom\n\nLightroom is a photo editing and management software that's designed specifically for photographers. It's available through a subscription model, but there's also a standalone version available for purchase. With Lightroom, you can organize and edit your photos, as well as create slideshows and web galleries.\n\nPhotoshop CS6\n\nPhotoshop CS6 is an older version of Photoshop that's no longer being updated by Adobe. However, if you're looking to buy Photoshop permanently and don't want to pay a subscription fee, you can still find CS6 available for purchase from third-party sellers. Keep in mind that CS6 is an older version of the software, so it may not work with the latest operating systems or hardware.\n\nPhotoshop AI is a powerful tool that can greatly enhance your photo editing capabilities. While the cost of this software may seem steep, it is important to consider the value it can bring to your work. Whether you are a professional photographer or simply someone who enjoys editing photos as a hobby, investing in Photoshop AI can be a worthwhile choice. Be sure to explore all of the pricing options available to find the one that best fits your needs and budget.

{"text": "How To Remove Bike Chain Grease From Clothes? 2023\n\nHere, you will know all about the famous and influential methods to keep yourself free from greases from your bikes. So, let's jump right into it!\n\nHow to Remove Bike Grease from Clothes?\n\nAs grease marks are straightforward to make your clothes dirty, proper caution about those is a must while working on your bike. Still, your routine bicycle maintenance, tire, or chain change can toll the apparel. That's why we will share some of the best methods to tackle this problem.\n\nBefore learning the methods, get a proper understanding of your cloth's fabric and washing technique. It's essential to use a specific washing technique to eliminate marks and spots from a particular piece of clothing. Otherwise, not only the grease patches will remain but also your clothes will be damaged as well.\n\nSo, before you hastily start cleaning the dress, be careful about which cleaning agents to use and what type of fabric your cloth has. Another important note for you is to wear gloves if you have sensitive skin or allergy issues to any cleaning materials. Your safety comes before your clothes.\n\nNow, we will look at different agents and the adaptability with certain fabrics so that you don't make a mistake. For your convenience, we have listed them in an orderly fashion so you can go to any section without reading the full post.\n\nRemove Bike Tire Grease from Clothes with Laundry Detergent.\n\nIt's appropriate to use a laundry detergent because it's more adaptive to clothes. However, it's best to use this type of detergent on synthetic ones.\n\nHere are the detailed guidelines:\n\nStep I: Get a Little Amount Before Wash\n\nTreat your cloth with just a few drops of your laundry detergent before giving it a complete wash. It does not matter whether your dress is fresh or dry as long as you are using this method.\n\nAfter doing that, gently rub it with a dosing ball or your hands if you don't have any dosing balls. Wait for five to ten minutes before going to the next step.\n\nStep II: Cold Water Treatment\n\nNow, it's time to clean with cold tap water. Ensure a cautious wash from both sides so that no black marks or spots are visible.\n\nFinal Step: Wash & Dry\n\nEven if all the dark marks are gone, it's safe to give it a natural wash. It's okay to use the hands or washing machine for that purpose. After cleaning your dress, hang it under bright sunlight.\n\nHow to Remove Bike Tire Grease Stains from Clothes by Dishwashing Liquid?\n\nDishwashing fluid is a popular household item, and its application even covers clearing out your bike stains without too much hassle. However, it works best on clothes that have synthetic or cotton fabrics. Also, cornflour or talcum is best if you wish to clean any deep marks.\n\nNow, follow these instructions:\n\nStep I: Use a Few Drops\n\nSimilar to other artificial agents, dishwashing fluid also has excellent capabilities. It can remove your bike tire marks as efficiently as any other washing fluids. So, applying a little of it is good enough to begin this method.\n\nIf the spots seem to be more scattered, it is recommended to use a concentrated mixture of dishwashing fluid and household soda for better results. After that, use any soft scrubber or old toothbrushes to scrub the black spots and stains away.\n\nStep II: Rinse the Stains with Tap Water\n\nBefore you wash your cloth with water, let it soak off the paste so that it can drag out the stains more effectively. After removing most of the colors with the mixture, you can now apply cold tap water to your cloth.\n\nWe recommend you keep the frontal side of the dress facing your basin. As the water moves from the less dirty part to the front, it will be more effective to eradicate those marks.\n\nFinal Step: Careful Wash & Dry\n\nIf you see no more visible spots on your cloth, wash them properly with care. Even if you think there's no need for a wash as you got every stain out of your apparel, it's better to be safe than sorry. So, after giving it a complete bath, hang it in a well-lit and dry place.\n\nHow to Eliminate T Grease from Clothes Using Baking Soda?\n\nOne of the most used chemical products in every house is baking soda. So, if you don't have any detergent or dishwashing liquids around, baking soda is more than enough to ease your pain of stain! However, try to limit your use with only wool and silk fabrics as other clothing materials may incur damages.\n\nHere are the quick step-by-step instructions for you:\n\nStep I: Dust Your Cloth with Baking Soda\n\nTake the baking soda and sprinkle them on the stains. Make sure you don't miss any spots and carefully leave them to dry.\n\nStep II: Wait for the Night to Pass\n\nThis step is different from others because it takes some time for baking soda to drag out the stains. So, after an overnight wait, use your old toothbrush to clear off the remaining grease spots.\n\nFinal Step: Wash it Thoroughly.\n\nAlways try to follow the instructions while washing your clothes to get a fresh look. After the cleaning process, look for any visible spots and if you don't find any, dry your apparel in proper sunlight.\n\nApart from the mentioned products, you can use soap, shampoo, non-artificial items such as citrus, vinegar or acidic substances, etc.\n\nHow to Remove Bike Grease from Clothes?\n\nConclusion\n\nWe know and understand how troublesome it is when our favorite piece of cloth becomes stained with bike grease. That's why we tried to create this post so that you don't have to deal with permanent patches or marks.\n\nJust make sure to follow these techniques and guidelines in the care label instructions. For any feedback or queries, feel free to comment without any hesitation. From now on, we hope that you will eliminate any bike grease stains without any problem.\n\nIf you are thinking about how long do road bike tires last?

{"text": "Schizophrenia is a psychotic disorder meaning that someone suffering from schizophrenia will be unable to distinguish between the real and the imaginary. This brain disorder strikes persons as they are entering the prime of their lives and in many cases, runs a recurrent and ultimately chronic course that leads to substantial disability.\n\nThis most devastating of mental illness affects the essence of what make people human- their personality and intellect. For these reasons schizophrenia is considered the prototypic mental illness.\n\nMore than any other mental illness, schizophrenia is synonymous in the public's mind with \"madness\": the family member who suddenly believed the neighbours are sending poisonous gas through the walls, the friend who is convinced that the neighbour had planted cameras to spy on him, and the colleague who believed that people around him can read his thoughts.\n\nSchizophrenia is neither new nor rare. It has likely existed for centuries, if not millennia. It's one of the leading causes of disability in the world, with a lifetime prevalence of about 1% of the population.\n\nThe lifetime prevalence among Indians is slightly lower (0.4%) according to the National Mental Health Survey 2015-16. According to latest data, it's prevalence is 24 million people worldwide i.e., 1 in every 300 individuals are affected with schizophrenia. Schizophrenia is a low incidence but a high prevalence disease, meaning that relatively few people develop it each year (15.9 per 100000 people) but once you develop it you have it for life.\n\nONSET OF SYMPTOMS\n\nSchizophrenia is equally prevalent in men and women but onset is earlier in men than women. The peak ages of onset are 10-25 years for men and 25-35 years for women. Onset of schizophrenia before 10 years of age or after age 60 years is rare but not unheard of. Before the illness truly manifests, there is a stage called the prodrome when it slowly becomes apparent to anyone paying attention that all is not well.\n\nThe problem is that prodromal symptoms mirror what many healthy teenagers experience in their routine passage through adolescence: sleep irregularities, difficulty in concentrating, vague feelings of tension or anxiety, a change in personality and perhaps a withdrawal from their peers.\n\nOften, parents will realize (after their child has been diagnosed with schizophrenia) that there had been an identifiable period of foreshadowing during which time they'd wondered if their child was struggling with depression or their inability to cope with the stress of growing up.\n\nSYMPTOMS\n\nThe symptoms of schizophrenia manifest gradually before crystallizing in three distinct forms:\n\n1. Positive symptoms- Some common positive symptoms are:\n\no Hearing voices not heard by others (e.g. voices giving a running commentary about his actions, voices commanding him to carry out certain uncomfortable or distressing tasks)\no Believing that his thoughts are being withdrawn from him or inserted into him or that his thoughts are being broadcasted everywhere\no Believing that some external agencies are moving his limbs against his will or that his emotions are being forced against his will\no Delusions (e.g. believing that his food is being poisoned, or that microchips had been implanted in his brain to gain access to his thoughts or that certain people have conspired to get him killed, etc)\n\nSchizophrenia basically affects all aspects of a person's life- thought, perception, emotion, cognition and this makes it a challenging illness, causing enormous difficulties to them and their loved ones. While the florid psychotic/positive symptoms are quite dramatic and bizarre and concerning and is usually what makes a person seek treatment in the first place, the cognitive symptoms are principally responsible for the enduring functional difficulties experienced by people with schizophrenia.\n\nThese problems relate to such basic life management skills as personal hygiene, scheduling and planning, social interaction, relationships, financial management, education, and work.\n\nCOURSE\n\nThe illness isn't something you contract and get over, like chickenpox or pneumonia. It is more like diabetes or hypertension, a condition that doesn't go away but that you can live with if you have appropriate treatment. Schizophrenia has a remitting and relapsing course but it is quite heterogenous even with treatment i.e.\n\no 30-40% will have only one episode\no 30-40% may have two or more episodes\no 10-20% may become manageable but continue to have some symptoms\no 10% of patients may not improve in spite of best treatment\n\nCAUSES AND RISK FACTORS\n\nThe current scientific understanding is that schizophrenia is a brain disorder caused by genes and/or environmental trauma, including social determinants of health, such as malnutrition, birth trauma, and poverty, that affects brain development and produce neurochemical changes and structural alterations.\n\nSchizophrenia is an equal opportunity illness. Gender, race, ethnicity, affluence, education- none of these provides immunity from schizophrenia. However, there are certain individuals who are at a higher risk of developing schizophrenia-\n\nMedications are absolutely essential for effective management of schizophrenia. Other treatment modalities such as electroconvulsive therapy, psychoeducation, family intervention, and rehabilitation are necessary but medications are the first line of treatment. Treating schizophrenia is complicated by its heterogeneity and by the need to intervene early.\n\nTimely, affective treatment can produce remission of symptoms and enable recovery in most patients. But if the illness goes untreated, or there are repeated relapses, their mental faculties start to deteriorate until they are unable to function normally.\n\nWithout treatment, they're defenceless against the ravages of schizophrenia, their lives often shortened by decades due to the medical complications and the societal neglect that the illness imposes. With timely treatment, people suffering from schizophrenia can lead healthy and meaningful lives and contribute significantly to society.\n\nOne of the most famous examples is renowned mathematician Prof. John Nash who, despite suffering from schizophrenia, won the Nobel Prize in Economics. His life is a testament to what someone with schizophrenia can achieve with support from family and loved ones and timely and effective intervention.\n\nWORLD SCHIZOPHRENIA DAY\n\nIn earlier times, when the causes and treatment of mental illnesses were barely known, mentally ill patients in asylums were often restrained to walls by chains in the wrong assumption that it would help control their symptoms. On 24th May 1793, Philippe Pinel, the man who is considered as the Father of Modern Psychiatry, unchained the patients in an asylum in France in the hopes of preserving their dignity as human beings.\n\nIn honour of Pinel and his early efforts to provide humane care and treatment to the mentally ill, every year since 1984, 24th May is observed as World Schizophrenia Day in the hope that worldwide observation of the day would help educate the public about schizophrenia, reduce stigma and discrimination faced by people with schizophrenia and challenge the misconceptions and stereotypes surrounding this disorder arising out of brain malfunctioning.\n\nWorld Schizophrenia Day aims to instil hope in people whose lives have been affected by this illness so that with early intervention the symptoms can be effectively managed andthey can go own to lead meaningful lives.\n\nThe very first step is to change our attitude towards people with schizophrenia and the words we use to talk about them. Remember, people with this illness are not schizophrenics. They have schizophrenia.\n\nAnd they can be your spouse, parent, sibling, or colleague. A diagnosis of schizophrenia need not be a death sentence; one can be mentally ill and still lead a rich and satisfying life with the right treatment and support.\n\n* Dr Meesha Haorongbam wrote this article for The Sangai Express\nThe writer can be reached at meeshahao(AT)gmail(DOT)com\nThis article was webcasted on May 25 2024.\n\nComment\n\n* Comments posted by users in", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "c92f0297-296a-422d-a1f2-57143ecd6656", "url": "https://e-pao.net/epSubPageExtractor.asp?src=education.Health_Issue.Understanding_schizophrenia_By_Meesha_Haorongbam"}

This used two app, Superimpose app to make the drawing a PNG and Do Ink Animation app to make the fish swim based on this lesson (#131 on my Smore page). Here are some of the results.\n\nMove it Make it\n\nMove it Make it Transdigital are emphasizes the digital and is supported by physical art. We looked at examples then tried one together. They made a flipbook style ghost animation that lifted off the iPad into a physical space using a plastic hologram viewer. See this post to learn how to try this yourself with my resources, examples, and tutorial.\n\nMerge it!\n\n70 minutes wasn't enough time to get through all three lessons. The Merge it lesson was based on the 1st grade Expressive Robots. This uses the animated glow technique where the animation glows through the drawing from below to complete the art. This handout was designed to help participants through the steps of making a robot with an expression, drawing a symbol that supports the emotion expressed, then laying this drawing over the animation of the symbol in Do Ink animation app as it glows through.\n\nGreat Post! You are shari ng a wonderful post.Animations are dynamic visual representations created through the manipulation of images, graphics, or objects to simulate movement. They serve various purposes, from entertainment in films and video games to instructional aids in education and training. Animations can be produced using traditional hand-drawn techniques, computer-generated imagery (CGI), or a combination of both. They are utilized across industries to convey complex ideas, tell stories, and engage audiences through captivating visual narratives", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "73995038-9807-4ace-8a9c-dc58860eaded", "url": "https://drydenart.weebly.com/fugleblog/transdigital-art-workshop-georgia"}
{"text": "Can life from Earth survive on a planet like Mars?\n\nAs the Perseverance rover hunts for evidence of past life on Mars' barren surface, researchers back on Earth are exploring just how difficult it might be for living organisms to survive there today.\nFindings published in the journal 'Frontiers in Microbiology' reveal that microorganisms from Earth may be able to survive. Scientists from the German Aerospace Center (DLR) and NASA launched an aluminium container with bacteria and fungus into the stratosphere. The two samples were kept in Martian atmosphere conditions and exposed to the Sun's ultraviolet radiation.\n\nCareful what we bring along to Mars\n\nSome of the microorganisms survived. \"We successfully tested a new way of exposing bacteria and fungi to Mars-like conditions by using a scientific balloon to fly our experimental equipment up to Earth's stratosphere,\" commented co-lead study author Marta Cortesão, a PhD student at DLR. \"Some microbes, in particular spores from the black mold fungus, were able to survive the trip, even when exposed to very high UV radiation.\"\n\"If a microbe can hack it up there, above much of the protective ozone layer, it just might be able to survive – however briefly – on a journey to the surface of Mars,\" co-author David J. Smith from NASA told 'CNN'.\n\nWhat does survival mean for space travel?\n\nSpores from the black mold Aspergillus niger and the bacterium Salinisphaera shabanensis managed to endure. \"Spores from the A. niger fungus are incredibly resistant – to heat, harsh chemicals, and other stressors – but no one had ever studied whether they could survive exposed in space or under intense radiation like we see on Mars,\" explained Cortesão. \"This experiment raises a lot of questions about what genetic mechanisms are key to making microbes able to survive. Do they carry ancient evolutionary traits that provide them the ability to withstand harsh conditions, or does the adaptation to their current environment provide protection for many other environmental challenges?\"\nSmith added these experiments make possible the study of \"the microbe's resiliency in ways that are impossible in the lab,\" and that they offer \"an opportunity to predict survival outcomes on Mars and help establish the limits of life as we know it.\"\nIn the future, we need to be careful of organisms and other contaminants we take with us in space, or those we may bring back. \"This research gives us a better understanding of which microbes could linger in environments once assumed to be lethal, like the surface of Mars, and gives us clues about how to avoid unintentionally bringing tiny hitchhikers with us to off-world destinations,\" noted co-author Ralf Moeller from DLR.\n\"With crewed long-term missions to Mars, we need to know how human-associated microorganisms would survive on the Red Planet, as some may pose a health risk to astronauts,\" observes co-lead author Katharina Siems, also a DLR PhD student. \"In addition, some microbes could be invaluable for space exploration. They could help us produce food and material supplies independently from Earth, which will be crucial when far away from home. Microorganisms are closely-connected to us; our body, our food, our environment, so it is impossible to rule them out of space travel.\"", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "b81429e6-0a43-410e-8f28-78a833220030", "url": "https://cordis.europa.eu/article/id/429317-trending-science-can-life-from-earth-survive-on-a-planet-like-mars"}

So if your rent is $1000, you should have $1000 in an emergency fund. If your mortgage is $1500 you should have $1500 in an emergency fund. Then build up to 3 months worth of monthly bills but always have one month of money to cover your place to live.\n\nGet Rid of your BAD debt. Before you focus too much on retirement planning and investing, are you carrying any bad debt or high interest rate debt? Don't earn 5-7% in a 401(k) while paying 28% on a credit card. Getting rid of bad debt will increase your ability to save and invest.\n\nIf you have family members that depend upon your income, make sure you have some kind of life insurance coverage. You never know when your time on earth will end. Leave your family in a strong position and have confidence that if something happened to you, you created an instant pool of money to take care of loved ones.\n\nBecome a good saver. What you save each year will be higher than what your investments can produce for many many years, so put the responsibility on what you can do versus what your investments can do. If you can save $3600 a year or $300 a month, that's equivalent to having $72,000 earning 5%. Once you become a good saver, then you must start investing so your money can earn compound interest and go to work for you each day.\n\nBuild up a small food storage and water storage. You never know when you might find yourself in an emergency, out of a job or living with rising food prices. Add a few extra cans or boxes each week. After a year you'll have a nice size emergency food and water collection to help you weather life's storms.\n\nDepending on where you live, typically homeownership will result in more wealth and a bigger net worth than renting. Learn about first time homebuyer programs and save for a down payment. Homeownership is almost always better than renting because a portion of every payment goes into your home equity. A home is a great forced savings payment and you have to have a place to live.\n\nThese 6 ideas are only a few of the many steps it takes to become financially independent but they are the best 6 to get you started on the road to financial freedom.\n\n1196 comentarios\n\nHeather Hopfinger\n\n14 abr 2022\n\nI have to prepare for a big Pinch Stephen this year with my anti seizure med way over 200 dollars and my allergy med for 10 dollars through my medical plan the other thing I have to prepare to pay is 35 dollars for an x ray and 89 dollars every time I go to a NP for PSYCH so that raise I got well guess where it is going yes to healthcare truth\n\nMe gusta\n\nMiembro desconocido\n\n11 jul 2023\n\nContestando a\n\nstephengardner053@gmail.com\n\nMe gusta\n\nvlharshbarger\n\n22 oct 2021\n\nLong time listener, first time corresponding.\n\nI'm 63 and not working (live-in caregiver for my senior parents) with no retirement plan.

{"text": "2/8/11\n\nWhen to admit a set is going poorly\n\nIs #4 a good idea? Seems like we comics always have the urge to say, \"Wow, this is a huge pile of fail!\" ...but as soon as we say that, at that point it DOES become a huge pile of fail.\n\nI chimed in there with my .02 on it which is, basically, you should avoid dwelling on things going poorly for as long as you can. You often wind up sabotaging yourself by going negative. But at some point, I do think it's worth pointing out the elephant in the room if that elephant is a roomful of people who clearly dislike the words coming out of your mouth.\n\n9 comments:\n\nI am a big proponent of not admitting this isn't going exactly as you planned. That way, if you're failing to make them laugh, and you're completely confident and happy about it, it's absurd, and you have a reason to laugh at yourself. Then you end up actually having fun with it.\n\nIn other words, call the elephant in the room. Name it. Make it your pet.\n\nAgain, this isn't about what is best for you. It's about what's best for the show. And dragging the room down by talking about how the show is bad is not best for the show.\n\nCrowds are naturally pretty resilient. If they see something they don't like, they'll wait it out and get to the next thing. (This only works within reason. Still, though.)\n\nBut as soon as you break into the show and say \"this is bad,\" that implicates the crowd in the failure. The one minute, they're sitting through a boring patch of the show waiting for the good part -- the next minute, they are in a tense situation.\n\nYou've turned up the volume on the bad part of the show, when you should be endeavoring to do no harm for the next acts' sake. This alleged elephant in the room is not the show's elephant -- it's your elephant. You're going to lead it out the door as soon as your set ends. No use calling attention to it.\n\nAnd how about the one guy in the back who's laughing? And the three guys over there on the side who aren't laughing but are enjoying what you're doing?\n\nHey, you just insulted them. You just told them they didn't like your act, when they were actually liking it just fine. And now you're gesturing at the room and talking about an elephant, and they don't see an elephant. They probably think you're crazy. Good work.\n\nAnd now you've created a hostile and unprofessional bunch of muck that the next act is going to have to address, either actively or at least tacitly. You've gone on after people who did that, right? Remember the uncontrollable sense of rage you felt at those guys for making you follow them?\n\nWell, have you ever felt that kind of rage at a guy who just did his act and kind of failed?\n\n\"This alleged elephant in the room is not the show's elephant -- it's your elephant. You're going to lead it out the door as soon as your set ends.\"\n\nGood point. Pretty much what I'm saying. Well, ECN you're saying don't bother acknowledging that things aren't going well because it makes things tense, and I'm saying, don't bother acknowledging that things aren't going well unless you'll do it in a way that doesn't make the room tense. I'm saying, change your mindset first. Don't let bombing affect you to the point that it ruins your performance.\n\nIf readers want a simpler answer to how you deal with bombing: be funnier next time.\n\nBut if readers want an answer to to how to feel about a set that goes differently than they planned, how to feel about the audience's reaction, how to behave professionally in the face of difficulty, where to place one's self-worth after it's all over, then it's good to keep hashing it out here through comments with other people putting in their two cents about what works for them.\n\nThe audience does the courtesy of watching, you do them the courtesty of performing as best you can, and then both parties go on to forget the other, whether the experience was good or bad.\n\nBut what if the elephant you're acknowledging is your own deficiencies? That doesn't put the onus on the crowd at all, and they can feel connected to someone putting themselves out there and coming to terms with a failed attempt. If done in a skilled and non-belligerent manner, this humanizes the comedian and could set a personalized tone for not only the rest of the set, but for the rest of the show. In club shows in particular the audience sees the comedian as somewhat of a celebrity no matter what they've accomplished. (I've done nothing and been asked to take pictures with people enough to know that.) So if you can create some sort of bridge to connect with them, no matter if its written or riffed then how can that not be beneficial? It's a skill like anything else in comedy that is learned by trial and error. So to say \"never do this\" is always counter intuitive to what being on stage and developing is all about.\n\nSorry for the double post, but case in point Mitch Hedberg. He was brilliant at picking apart his own material and dismissing it as stupid while keep the audience 100 percent on his side. I think there's a big difference in commenting on a bad show as opposed to talking about your own personal bad set. Saying \"this show is real shitty\" is obviously always a terrible idea.\n\n\"But what if the elephant you're acknowledging is your own deficiencies? That doesn't put the onus on the crowd at all...\"\n\nYeah, it does. If you're like, \"hey, by the way, I'm bad at this,\" then they're going to feel cheated. They've come out to see comedians, and here they are watching a guy who KNOWS he's not good and decided to go up anyway.\n\nAnd if you're like, \"hey, that was a dumb joke I just did,\" then they're going to feel cheated. They've come out to see comedians, and here they are watching a guy who isn't even TRYING to entertain them.\n\nWhich... well, some very specific comedians can get away with the latter. But you REALLY have to finesse it, and it really only works if... well, consider Mitch Hedberg. He had two things:\n\na) Kind of a goofy slacker thing going on, where \"not trying\" (or at least not LOOKING like he was trying) was part of his charm. He also had:\n\nb) A bunch of awesome jokes. Do you think Mitch Hedberg was talking about \"hey, that was a dumb joke\" after bombing unremittingly for three minutes? No. He did that after killing for several minutes with great material, and then doing one dumb joke -- and before killing for several MORE minutes with more great material.\n\nTalking about bombing always goes much better when you're not bombing.\n\nOh, and one more thing. You talked about the mystique -- the kind of automatic legitimacy -- that comics have on their side, especially at club shows.\n\nIf you start \"humanizing\" yourself by talking about how you're failing, that's out the window -- not just for you, but for the rest of the bill. You'd better hope the restof the bill didn't hope to use that advantage for anything...", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "ee03fe30-763b-4c65-a546-bc92505c19e4", "url": "http://www.sandpapersuit.com/2011/02/when-to-admit-set-is-going-poorly.html"}

{"text": "Explore the North Rift of Kenya\n\nExplore the North Rift of Kenya – In Africa, the Great Rift Valley stretches across East Africa like a great scar, extending from Tanzania through Kenya and into Ethiopia, from south to north. Most of the Great Rift Valley falls in Kenya's Rift Valley Province and is said to be the most beautiful section of the rift.\n\nThe Great Rift Valley, in its entirety across the African continent, is more than 6,430 kilometres long and, in places, up to 1,520 metres deep – all caused by the movement of tectonic plates and volcanic activity.\n\nWhen viewed from outer space, it is contested as the single most identifiable geographic landmark on the face of the planet. It's estimated to be approximately 40 million years old and is responsible for producing Mount Kenya and Mount Kilimanjaro, two of Africa's revered summits – where for ages tourists have been flocking to test their physical endurance.\n\nLike those tourists, Kenyan athletes hold the reputation of dominating long-distance races in many world athletic competitions. In celebration of their achievements, song and dance, pomp, and most importantly, a sip of cool \"mursik\" from an intricately adorned traditional gourd. But how did mursik became an integral part of this congratulatory ritual? Oluokos with communities takes you into an exploration of the unconventional side. Taking a look back at the history and significance of \"mursik\".\n\n\"Mursik\" is an integral part of the culture and heritage of the Kalenjin community, home to many of Kenya's renowned runners. The Kalenjin community principally live in Rift-Valley Kenya, and are an ethnic grouping of eight culturally and linguistically related groups, that is, the Kipsigis, Nandi, Tugen, Keiyo,Marakwet, Pokot, Sabaot (who live in the Mount Elgon region, overlapping the Kenya/Uganda border), and the Terik. Their present-day homeland is Kenya's Western highlands and the Rift Valley.\n\nThis tangy yet sweet velvety milk is a drink of choice, and has become embodied in the country's athletics achievements and many other Kalenjin cultural events and triumphant celebrations. It has been popularized by Kenyan Kalenjin athletes, leaders and other achievers who ceremoniously take a sip of this wonder drink upon their triumphant homecomings. The cultural significance of mursik leans on social values, meanings and beliefs and also on dietary and nutritional values.\n\nMursik is a special cuisine that is an integral part of the Kalenjin people's culture and heritage. The custom, believed to be centuries old, is hypothesized as having began as a way of preserving milk during a glut period of milk production. In #Oluokoslocalknowledgesharing, it is worth noting that Mursik is not any typical dairy product; but a traditional Kalenjin culinary delight that has been a part of the community's culture for centuries. With an iconic history tracing back more than 300 years, mursik is believed to have started as a way of preserving milk during a glut in production.\n\nThe drink is made from fermented milk preserved in traditional gourds lined with specially ground fine charcoal from select trees It all starts with fresh cow, goat, or sometimes sheep milk, that is well boiled, and then cooled to a required temperature. It is then poured into a traditional gourd known as a sotet.\n\nMursik is traditionally prepared through the fermentation of raw goat or cow milk in a special gourd locally known as Sotet. Days before the milk is treated, a small branch of an Itet tree (Senna didymobotrya) is debarked and allowed to dry. Once dry, one end of the itet stick is charred in an open fire and then the soot is rubbed on the inner surface of a cleaned gourd, and this gives mursik its characteristic sweet and smoky flavor, with a tangy twist. The charcoal inside the sotet infuses the smoky flavor to the milk and gives it its signature bluish tinge. The sotet is then corked and stored in a cool, dry place to allow for fermentation for at least three days after which the whey is drained. The gourd is then shaken repeatedly to give the mursik a smooth consistency. Afterwards, ash is added as an antiseptic and flavor enhancer. Some Kalenjin sub groups also add small quantities of blood obtained from prickling a vein in the neck of a healthy bull, which is then gently stirred to remove fibrin. Adding animal blood makes the mursik rich in iron and protein and was traditionally given to women who had just delivered or warriors who were wounded in battle. It is shaken well before drinking, to ensure that a uniformly thick emulsion is formed.\n\nThe making of mursik has been an integral component of the Kalenjin heritage for centuries and, is a traditional craft worth conserving. It is the pride of this community.The preparation of mursik requires knowledge and expertise, and is a food believed to have potency, especially when consumed from childhood into adulthood. Mursik is believed to be medicinal and aid in the prevention of constipation as well as the prevention of kidney ailments. Mursik is also believed to be an anti-pyretic food and as such those who regularly consume it rarely complain of having a fever. Mursik also aids in weight loss since the body does not produce specific enzymes meant to digest milk.\n\nThe preparation and consumption of mursik provides, moreover, a material means for expressing the more abstract significance of social systems and cultural values. The cultural significance of mursik is deep; it may be argued that what people are prepared to take inside their system reflects their social identities, and their membership of social groups. To view eating habits as a matter of culture is to understand that they are a product of codes of conduct and the structure of social relationships of the society in which they occur. The Kalenjin has been a conservative community.\n\nMursik is perhaps the most significant point of contact with the Kalenjin community: A sip of this special milk signifies more than just a meal: It is a medium through which stronger bonds are built.\n\nDrinking of Mursik reinforces group identity among the Kalenjin, while keeping heritage alive. The cultural significance of Mursik is deeply ingrained, and seen as a mechanism for detecting ethnic, cultural and social identity.\n\nMursik is considered one of the most important elements in defining ideological, ethnic, political and social identities of the Kalenjin communities. Despite modernization, the Kalenjin have preserved their cultural identity and still keep their tradition alive", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "dd877350-7ee0-4c73-b437-e68f1b3ab1fa", "url": "https://www.oluokos.com/explore-the-north-rift-of-kenya/"}

{"text": "When to Engage in Case Management\n\nWhen a participant or one of their family members is in crisis, it is very difficult to work on or even think about setting goals. Case management is a time to work directly on a family's immediate needs. In many social services organizations, case management is the default approach to working with families. It can often be transactional, such as determining eligibility, enrolling participants in programs, or providing referrals. Staff usually drive the process by identifying and coordinating services from both inside and outside their agency.\n\nCase management is helpful when staff are responsive to participants, follow through on referrals, and help families get the support they need quickly and efficiently.\n\nCase management can be unhelpful when staff take a paternalistic or punitive approach, when expectations are unclear, and when processes are duplicative and complex. Families working with case managers sometimes express feeling a lack of respect, being looked down on, or feeling bad about asking for help.\n\nIn case management, the coach is frequently the driver–determining timelines and providing services within the constraints of the organization and referral partners. However, these tasks can still be done with a coaching mindset by calling on the strengths and capabilities of families.\n\nUse these tips to apply a Family-Centered Coaching mindset to case management:\n\nAsk the participant if you can switch to a case management approach.\n\nAsk the participant if you can share information or specific resources about the issue they are experiencing. The participant decides if and when they are ready to receive that information.\n\nCheck your own assumptions by asking, \"Am I understanding that correctly?\" or \"What am I missing?\"\n\nDiscuss options together to ensure the participant makes the decision about which option to pursue.\n\nAn example of applying a coaching mindset to case management: In a coaching session, a participant and coach are discussing the participant's goal to help their teenager to enroll in college, when the participant brings up a health crisis they are experiencing. The coach asks the participant if they can switch to a case-management approach and the participant agrees. The coach asks if they can share resources about treatment options. The participant is hesitant because they are worried about paying for the health services. The coach offers to provide resources on health insurance options and the participant agrees. The coach reflects back the information they heard from the participant and asks \"What am I missing?\" The participant and coach discuss the participant's options and decide to schedule an appointment to determine health insurance eligibility.\n\nThe Prosperity Agenda provides these resources as the designated national administrator of Family-Centered Coaching.", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "9a7194f0-d89f-4ddc-9953-281dd513abb7", "url": "https://familycenteredcoaching.org/coaching-toolkit/when-to-engage-in-case-management/"}
{"text": "What Is Environmental Management?\n\nEnvironmental Management is the process of evaluating risks posed by an organisation to the environment, then bringing those risks under control, and actively managing them.\n\nEvery single organisation has an impact on the world, and very few will have a positive impact. The frontrunners in environmental management are often trying to make their environmental impact neutral, while some use profits after environmental management to offset or give back to the environment, such as investing profits into atmospheric carbon capture.\n\nWhether your organisation makes coffee, uses pens, makes digital content, or uses excavators doesn't matter, it all has a cost and that cost needs to be managed by someone.\n\nEnvironmental management is good for business\n\nOften one of the main things that organisations look to tackle when it comes to implementing changes to improve their management of environmental risks will be waste. Not just waste materials, but also wasted materials and wasted resource.\n\nThe impact of 10 plastic-wrapped sandwiches is lower than the impact of 10 plastic-wrapped sandwiches which are needlessly thrown away.\n\nThe impact of a fridge used to prevent food waste is lower than the impact of an empty fridge left on needlessly.\n\nWhere things get complicated is the way that things interact. In our sandwiches and fridge example, which is the greater issue – the cost of running a refrigerator to keep the sandwiches fresh or the cost of not running the refrigerator and throwing them away?\n\nThis is often where sustainability and social sustainability will tie in with environmental issues.\n\nJust because something is cheap to the purchaser doesn't mean that it is therefore fine to throw away, and that it has a low impact on the world.\n\nA great example is batteries.\n\nNot only are they difficult to dispose of safely and cleanly, the materials to make them are often mined or processed in countries with less strict law or fewer worker rights, potentially having a significantly negative impact on those producing the batteries.\n\nLet's say that the consumer pays £4 for a pack of 8 batteries. That's only 50p each, but the environmental cost of proper disposal, initial cost of creation, negative impact on the environment in the country which produced the batteries, and the social cost to the workers is probably far greater than what the consumer paid.\n\nIf the batteries aren't disposed of properly (for example, by throwing them into household waste) and they cause a fire, the costs would quickly and vastly outstrip what the consumer paid, especially if the fire was substantial, such as if the batteries being left in household waste lead to a waste collection vehicle fire.\n\nThis is where sustainability comes in…\n\nSustainability in relation to businesses means to consume, use or affect something in a manner that results in its longevity and the ability for that resource to not be depleted. This can include purchasing sustainable products and equipment, producing sustainably, using things sustainably and not negatively impacting the world such as dumping waste into the local watercourse.\n\nIt is possible to use sustainable resources in a way that is unsustainable. For example, if you bought 10 reams of sustainably sourced paper then left it outside in the rain and it was destroyed. Similarly, if you had equipment designed to improve your environmental impacts and neglect or damage it, such as not maintaining solar panels or letting your warehouse of e-bikes burn down.\n\nEnvironmental management looks at the bigger picture\n\nHow can environmental risks be eliminated, substituted, or otherwise controlled or offset?\n\nEliminate / substitute\nEliminating environmental risks can often be complicated, after all if you can afford to not do something that may be harmful to the environment, why have you been doing it in the first place? Processes, products and equipment are usually present for a reason, and it's difficult to eliminate one without replacing it with something else that comes with its own set of challenges and hazards.\n\nFor example, if you fully digitised your entire organisation and use no paper, you have eliminated the environmental risks associated with paper, but you've substituted paper for another risk – power, batteries, and electronics.\n\nOffset\nIt is unlikely that a small business, or one that rents or shares their premises, will be able to afford to install enough solar panels or wind turbines to result in their power generation being fully sustainable, and therefore having a lower impact on the environment. However, they may be able to choose an energy supplier that produces sustainable power.", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "ad1c5381-f1bd-4755-86e5-f63cef25dc75", "url": "https://actassociates.co.uk/news/what-is-environmental-management/"}

{"text": "Lotteries are an organized form of gambling togel. They are a means of raising funds for a variety of public purposes. This could include fortification, roads, libraries, schools and colleges, and more. In some cases, lotteries are endorsed by governments. However, they are not always legal. Some countries outlaw the use of lottery tickets.\n\nThe first lottery on record was held in Hamburg, Germany, in 1614. It was sponsored by wealthy noblemen who participated in Saturnalian revels. These lottery games offered prizes in the form of \"Pieces of Eight,\" \"Third Class,\" and \"Third Class Plus.\" Each guest received a ticket. There were 4304 tickets sold. Those who won received articles of unequal value.\n\nAfter this initial introduction, the Roman Empire held several more lottery games. The town records of Ghent indicate that lotteries may have been held as early as the 15th century. During the Roman Empire, lotteries were usually held at dinner parties. Most prize money was for fancy dinnerware.\n\nLotteries were popular in the Netherlands during the 17th and 18th centuries. Several colonies used lotteries to finance local militias, fortifications, and roads. Many private lotteries were held to raise money for the Virginia Company of London, which supported settlement in America at Jamestown.\n\nWhile most forms of gambling were illegal in the United States by the early 20th century, some states permitted lotteries. Ticket sales went to local businesses and taxpayers, and the money was divided between the general fund and a school fund. Other states used the funds for public projects such as roads, bridges, parks, and libraries.\n\nA few government-sanctioned lotteries still exist, such as the Connecticut Lottery. Profits are distributed to the general fund, education, and retired employee benefits. The Connecticut Lottery is one of the oldest lottery organizations in the US.\n\nAnother multi-state lottery is the Colorado Lottery. It offers Powerball and Mega Millions. It also features a number of state-based games. In addition, the Colorado lottery also has several other multi-state draw games.\n\nAlthough it isn't legal to play the lotteries in most states, some states allow players to purchase tickets online. Online lottery websites make it easy for people to purchase tickets and compare the odds of different lottery games. One of the best online lottery sites allows users to choose numbers with confidence. Sites that support Android and iOS devices allow users to play the lottery from their mobile phones.\n\nFor many, the thrill of a winning lottery ticket is enough to keep them playing. But not everyone is lucky enough to win the big jackpot. Smaller prizes still represent a great deal of money, but the odds are much better. Since the chance of winning is random, buying more tickets increases your chances of getting a higher payout.\n\nIn recent years, third-party lottery apps have emerged. Jackpocket, for instance, is a lottery app that lets you buy lottery tickets over the Internet. Using this service, you can play various lotteries and check your winnings.\n\nThe lottery was a popular way for governments to raise funds during the Middle Ages and to improve fortifications. It also helped the poor. George Washington was known to organize lotteries throughout his life. In fact, tickets from his 1768 Mountain Road Lottery became collector's items and sold for up to $15,000! Today, most governments recognize the value of a lottery and organize various types of them. Most countries, however, have monopolies on the lottery market to prevent private enterprises from competing against the state.\n\nWhile online lotteries are not yet widespread in the United States, they are becoming more popular. Currently, there are seven states that offer online lottery play. Although legal in most places, there are some restrictions that can make playing a lottery online illegal in certain states. These restrictions may mean that buying a lottery ticket online is not the best option in your state.\n\nMany lottery websites have e-games, which are similar to instant lottery tickets but offer gameplay through the internet. In New Jersey, for example, a lottery commission has created a version of CyberSlingo and Tetris that involve drawing and matching a series of numbers. These two games offer a way to play lottery games online and even win prizes.\n\nSome lottery websites track the locations of their players. If you buy your tickets online, most websites and applications use geolocation. However, if you purchase your tickets in person, it doesn't matter where you are as long as you are a resident of that state. This ensures a safer and more reliable experience. Many sites also have a limit function, which allows you to limit the amount of money you spend.\n\nWhile New York does not currently have an online lottery, residents can purchase tickets through a third party site. This platform allows residents to scan their tickets togel hongkong and claim their prizes if they win. This service is widely available, but there are some legal implications. Some people have argued that this is illegal gambling.

Today, the US lottery is an extremely popular way for people to win prizes and get rid of debt.\n\nThere are a lot of people who would like to win the lottery. It is one of the world's most popular activities and the lottery has been a popular way of winning money for centuries.

In the United States, lottery games were first offered in the early 1700s. Newspaper ads from that time period show that there were hundreds of lotteries in the country. In the 20th century, the lottery was introduced in New Hampshire and Puerto Rico.\n\nOne of the most popular lottery strategies is to pool money with friends or family members and buy tickets in a lottery syndicate. The prize money is then divided up among the members togel singapore of the syndicate. This method allows you to maximize your chances of winning. It can be a great way to win big.

In some states, lottery agents win a fifth of the top jackpots. It is important to remember that the lottery agent cannot claim the prize if you are not the winner.\n\nAlthough legal online lottery sales have experienced an inauspicious start, they have been steadily growing ever since. In the year prior to its launch, Pennsylvania's online lottery reported sales of $4 billion dollars. This paved the way for other states to regulate online gambling. While opponents are citing valid issues related to cannibalization and problem gambling, the legal landscape is shifting in favor of the online lottery.\n\nWhen playing the lottery online, it is important to keep in mind that many lottery games are free and are not actually free.

In many cases, proceeds from the lottery go to local schools or nonprofit organizations.\n\nBefore the internet, lottery fans could only participate in games at specific locations.

And how can you win the lottery? How can you make the most of this new technology? This article will explore those questions and more.\n\nThe house edge of most togel singapore games is nearly 50%. This is so low that many lottery aficionados argue that it doesn't matter. After all, the payout can change your life. The odds of winning the jackpot are almost non-existent. Moreover, there are no deposits required at these betting sites. And if you win, you get all of the winnings in one place, which is the main purpose of lottery play! But if you aren't willing to take the chance, you might as well just stick to your preferred lottery site.\n\nNorth Dakota has its own lottery system, which was approved by voters in 2002.

For example, you can play the Powerball lottery in 45 states. The draw takes place at 10:59pm ET on Mondays and Wednesdays and ticket sales are usually close a couple of hours before each drawing. To play, you pick five numbers between 1 and 69, and one number between 1 and 26.\n\nPeople have been playing the lottery for centuries, with the first cash game, La Lotto di Firenze, being played more than four centuries ago. The thrill of winning a million dollars and the fantasy of a successful life are universal. But what does the future hold for lottery players?

In fact, lottery ticket purchases are among the most common types of gambling activity worldwide. The US lottery alone has 177 different games and almost 1,000 drawings each week.\n\nIn the early modern era, lottery-style games became common in Low-Countries towns. They were held for various public purposes, including raising money for fortifications and helping the poor. The idea of taxing people with a simple game was very popular. According to records, the oldest recorded lottery was held in 1726 in L'Ecluse, France.

{"text": "Admin Mugtama\n\nIn an Islamic context, separating genders is based on the idea of modesty and maintaining proper interactions between men and women. It's important to know that different Islamic scholars and cultural practices may have different views on this topic. Let's explore some of the benefits associated with a separated-gender society in an Islamic context.\n\nPreservation of Modesty\n\nModesty is highly valued in Islam for both men and women. In a separated-gender society, physical segregation helps reduce opportunities for inappropriate interactions. This creates a more modest and respectful environment.\n\nProtection of Honor\n\nSeparation is seen as a way to protect the honour and reputation of individuals and families. Minimizing interactions between unrelated men and women, reduces the risk of illicit relationships or misunderstandings.\n\nFocus on Religious Observance\n\nSeparation can create an environment that allows individuals to focus more on their religious duties and worship without distractions or attractions.\n\nAvoidance of Temptations\n\nMinimizing interactions between unrelated men and women helps reduce the risk of temptation and potential sins.\n\nRespect for Privacy\n\nGender segregation is seen as a way to uphold the privacy and personal space of individuals. Everyone's personal space is respected.\n\nPreserving Family Values\n\nAdvocates argue that maintaining separate spaces for men and women fosters stronger family values and reduces the risk of extramarital relationships that could threaten the family unit.\n\nCultural and Social Norms\n\nIn many Muslim-majority societies, separated gender spaces have become ingrained cultural norms. They are accepted as a way to maintain social order and harmony.\n\nIn a small town in France, a young Muslim named Izzeddin Hamdi did something incredibly brave. He risked his own life to save 17 people from a burning building, including a baby!\n\nThe Terrifying Fire It all happened on a Friday in Romans-sur-Isere, a town in southeastern France. Suddenly, a fire broke out in a two-story building. The flames were spreading fast, and everyone inside was in danger.\n\nA Hero Emerges But then, out of nowhere, Izzeddin Hamdi, who works as a baker, appeared on the scene. Without thinking twice, he rushed into the burning building to rescue the people trapped inside. Can you believe it?\n\nA Daring Rescue Even though the fire was raging and the smoke was thick, Hamdi didn't hesitate. He climbed up a ladder and entered the building through a window. One by one, he helped 17 people escape from the flames. He even saved a baby! What an incredible act of bravery!\n\nA Hero's Recognition Word of Hamdi's heroic actions quickly spread throughout the neighbourhood and on social media. People couldn't stop praising him for his courage and selflessness. Many even suggested that he should receive the Legion of Honor, which is the highest award in France.\n\nThe Firefighters' Perspective When the firefighters arrived at the burning building, they were amazed by what they saw. The flames were already 5-6 meters (16-20 feet) high. Baptiste Devis, one of the firefighters, expressed his admiration for Hamdi's bravery.\n\n\"Israeli\" soldiers shot and killed a child late Wednesday during a raid on the city of Qalqilya in the occupied West Bank.\n\nThe child, who suffered a serious head wound from a bullet fired by the occupation forces, was taken to the Qalqilya State Hospital and subsequently passed away, according to a statement by the Palestinian Ministry of Health.\n\nDetails of the child's identity and age were not provided.\n\nIsraeli soldiers raided Nakkar district in the western part of Qalqilya in the late hours, according to information obtained by Anadolu from local eyewitnesses.\n\nThe soldiers used live and rubber bullets and tear gas on the Palestinian youth, who attempted to prevent the raid by throwing stones and Molotov cocktails.\n\nWhile Israel has not yet issued a statement on the matter, the raids were reportedly carried out with the aim of apprehending wanted persons.\n\nSince the beginning of this year, the West Bank has been tense due to the Israeli army's repeated incursions into Palestinian cities, arresting and liquidating people it considers \"wanted,\" as well as Israeli settlers' repeated attacks on Palestinian villages and towns./AA\n\nYesterday, a group called Danske Patrioter did something truly awful. They burned the Quran outside the Turkish and Egyptian embassies in Copenhagen. This act of hate has caused a lot of anger and sadness in the Muslim world.\n\nDenmark Condemns the Burning The Danish government is not happy about what happened. They called it a \"shameful act\" that disrespects the religion of others. The Foreign Ministry even said that this kind of thing hurts a lot of people and creates division between different religions and cultures. They want everyone to know that Denmark believes in freedom of religion and that Muslims are an important part of their country.\n\nNo Action Taken Even though the Danish government is upset about the Quran burning, they haven't done anything to punish the people responsible. This has made a lot of people angry because they think those responsible should be held accountable for their actions.\n\nResponse from Iraq When Iraq heard about what happened, they were really mad. The Foreign Minister of Denmark, Lars Lokke Rasmussen, talked to his counterpart in Iraq to try to make things better. He said that Denmark condemns these terrible acts and wants all protests to be peaceful.\n\nA Change of Heart in Sweden In Sweden, there was a man who wanted to burn the Quran in front of the Iranian Embassy in Stockholm. But he changed his mind. He realized that it was wrong and disrespectful to Islam. He even apologized to all Iranians for his actions.\n\nElon Musk, CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, has recaptured the title of \"the richest person in the world,\" surpassing French luxury goods mogul Bernard Arnault, the president of group LVMH.\n\nAccording to Forbes magazine's list of the world's richest people, Musk's net worth increased by 1.75% as of noon local time to $240.7 billion.\n\nThe increase in the valuation of Tesla shares by more than 2.5% had an impact on Musk regaining the title.\n\nThe wealth of Arnault, chairman of luxury goods giant LVMH, which owns Louis Vuitton, Christian Dior and Tiffany, fell more than 1% to $234.9 billion. Musk surpassed Arnault and took first place in the list of the richest people in the world.\n\nJeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon and the richest person in the world for a while, took third place with a fortune of $151.9 billion.\n\nBezos was followed by Oracle founder and former CEO Larry Ellison with $148.1 billion, Microsoft founder Bill Gates with $120.6 billion and Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffet with $117.3 billion.\n\nMusk, who bought Twitter for $44 billion last year, changed the company's logo from \"blue bird\" to the letter \"X\" on Sunday and directed the X.com domain name to the site.\n\nMohammed Abu Ziada, a 30-year-old Palestinian farmer living in the blockaded Gaza Strip, has achieved his first successful harvest of red corn, using imported seeds from China.\n\nHe cultivated the red corn on his farm in the northern town of Beit Lahia in the Gaza Strip, harvesting the first crop from the imported seeds.\n\nRed corn, known for its distinct taste compared to white and yellow varieties, is recognized for its smaller kernels.\n\nSpeaking to Anadolu, Abu Ziada said he decided to plant the imported seeds to pioneer agricultural practices in Gaza.\n\nHe said that red corn is typically grown from summer to autumn, influenced by the region's climate conditions.\n\nThe Palestinian entrepreneur farmer discovered red corn about two years ago during a business trip to China, where he aimed to engage in trade and import products.\n\nDue to the 16-year Israeli blockade on Gaza, Abu Ziada has faced considerable hardships. He expressed his desire to share this experience with the people of Gaza, who have been facing worsening economic conditions.\n\nHe made an agreement with another Palestinian farmer in April to tend to the corn's cultivation and care. He said he would distribute the first harvest to anyone interested in trying it, free of charge, and expressed his intention to import more seeds in the future to trade red corn in Gaza.\n\nNoting that he imported only a small quantity of seeds for the trial, he said 3-4 kilograms (6.6-8.8 pounds) of seeds are required per acre.\n\n\"We are traders who search for goods. When we come across a new product, we bring in small quantities for testing purposes to avoid significant losses in case of failure,\" he added.\n\nRegarding the public interest in red corn, he said it has garnered attention in Gaza and become popular on social media. He said he has received numerous messages from people expressing an interest in purchasing the corn after the harvest.\n\nAbu Ziada also pointed out that red corn requires less water and fewer agricultural chemicals compared to other corn varieties.\n\nAccording to the Euro-Mediterranean Human Rights Monitor, due to Israel's blockade and restrictions imposed since 2007, around 61.6% of Gaza's population, which has reached 2.3 million, is living in poverty, with an unemployment rate of approximately 47%.\n\nFormer Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert said Monday that the country is entering a civil war after the Knesset approved a controversial bill limiting the Supreme Court's ability to challenge government decisions.\n\n''There is a threat. It is a serious threat. It's never happened before, and we are going into a civil war now,\" Olmert told the British media.\n\n''The government has decided to threaten the foundations of Israeli democracy, and this is not something that we can accept or that we can tolerate,'' he said.\n\nEarlier on Monday, the Knesset, or Israeli parliament, approved a bill sought by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to restrict the Supreme Court's power to overrule government actions.\n\nThe contentious judicial overhaul plan has triggered 29 weeks of mass protests, some of the biggest in Israel's history.\n\nThe government says the package is meant to restore power to elected officials, but critics argue it is a power grab by Netanyahu, who is on trial for corruption./AA\n\nA top US rights envoy in Bangladesh said Thursday that conditions remain unsafe for the return of ethnic Rohingya refugees to Myanmar, with Washington pledging further aid for the crisis.\n\nBangladesh is home to around a million members of the stateless minority, most of whom fled a 2017 military crackdown in neighbouring Myanmar that is now subject to a genocide probe at the International Criminal Court.\n\n\"We support efforts to create the conditions for eventual, safe, dignified, informed and voluntary return of Rohingya — conditions that do not currently exist,\" the US Under Secretary for Civilian Security, Democracy and Human Rights Uzra Zeya told reporters in Dhaka.\n\nBangladesh and Myanmar have discussed efforts to begin repatriating Rohingya refugees to their homeland, where they have been subject to decades of persecution and are denied citizenship.\n\n\"Obviously, we will not do anything to harm the refugees or Rohingyas that we have, who have been welcomed in Bangladesh,\" Momen said.\n\nDozens have been killed in Rohingya camp clashes between rival insurgent forces this year, with Human Rights Watch on Thursday warning of \"surging violence by armed groups and criminal gangs\".\n\nThe United States is the biggest donor to Rohingya humanitarian efforts, contributing more than $2.1 billion in aid to Rohingyas and host communities in Bangladesh.\n\nFunding cuts forced the United Nations food agency to cut rations to refugee settlements twice this year, with aid workers warning that the move would likely worsen the already precarious security situation in the camps.\n\nZeya on Thursday announced a further $74 million in aid, including for Rohingyas refugees in Bangladesh and in camps in Myanmar's Rakhine state.\n\nThe US diplomat also met Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina and discussed \"the need for free and fair elections\" due in January 2024./AFP\n\nThe European Union has concrete plans to combat Islamophobia, Marion Lalisse, the new EU coordinator on combating anti-Muslim hatred, said Thursday, Anadolu Agency reports.\n\nLisse, who was appointed to the position on 2 February, held a press conference in Brussels and answered questions from journalists.\n\nShe highlighted that the Muslim community in Europe is the largest religious minority, with diverse numbers, percentages and origins among member countries of the Union.\n\n\"However, the key point is that the Muslim community in the EU is an integral part of our society,\" said Lisse. \"We proposed the preparation of a document by mapping the phenomenon of hatred against Muslims.\"\n\nAsked about concrete plans to combat Islamophobia, referring to the Quran burning incidents in Sweden, she said that \"firstly, we will mainstream policies to combat anti-Muslim hatred in various sectors such as education, security, migration and many employment areas.\"\n\n\"We will maintain dialogue with various institutions, civil society, actors, citizens and international organisations. We will implement evidence-based policies and raise awareness among citizens and institutions about the phenomenon of Islamophobia,\" she added./MEM", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "6bb9283a-3dfd-4669-9e01-3538f8fa807d", "url": "https://en.mugtama.com/index.php/social-issues/education-morals/itemlist/user/667-adminmugtama?start=300"}
{"text": "Many of the world's sinking deltas due to human activities\n\nPublished:\n21 September 2009\n\nHuman-induced factors are causing many of the world's largest deltas, home to almost half a billion people, to sink more rapidly than could be explained by climate change, according to a new international study.\n\nThe study, which is published today in Nature Geoscience, says that human use of the world's low-lying deltas, many of which are densely populated and heavily farmed, are causing them to sink more rapidly than by rising sea levels alone.\n\nUsing globally consistent and high-resolution satellite data, the study assessed 33 deltas in countries including China, India and the US for their tendency to flooding and to see why they are sinking more rapidly than the global sea level is rising. It found that in the past 10 years, 85 per cent of the deltas experienced severe flooding, resulting in the temporary submergence of 260,000 square kilometres of land and that 24 out of 33 major deltas are sinking.\n\nHowever, according to researchers this vulnerability to flooding, either from their feeding rivers or from ocean storms, is a result of a host of human-induced factors. These are the creation of river dams and reservoirs, where sediment is trapped upstream rather than adding to a delta; the removal of oil, gas and water from a delta's underlying sediments; and the use of floodplain engineering, all in combination with rising global sea levels.\n\nProfessor Robert Nicholls, from the University of Southampton, who co-authored the report says: \"We conservatively estimate that the delta surface area vulnerable to flooding could increase by 50 per cent under currently projected values for sea level rise in the twenty-first century. This figure could increase if the capture of sediment upstream persists and continues to prevent the growth and buffering of the deltas.\n\n\"These human-induced factors greatly exacerbate the risks faced by inhabitants of deltas, which number nearly 500 million people, under scenarios of global warming. To effectively deal with these problems is challenging and will take a fundamental shift in how we manage these systems, including recognising the multiple drivers of increasing risks.\"\n\nThese inhabitants and all infrastructure in deltaic lowlands is at risk of flooding from rivers or ocean storms. Already every year, it is estimated that about 10 million people are being affected by storm surges, with most of these people in the big Asian deltas. Hurricane Katrina may be the example that stands out in the US, but in the Asian deltas of the Irrawaddy and Ganges-brahmaputra floods have recently claimed thousand of lives as well. The study predicts that similar disasters could potentially happen in other deltas, such as the Pearl and Mekong deltas, which have tens of thousands of kilometres of area below sea level and are exposed to typhoons.", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "a44d3983-1ef0-4f59-8cff-393338173229", "url": "https://www.southampton.ac.uk/news/2009/09/worlds-sinking-deltas-due-to-human-activities.page"}
{"text": "What is Roulette?\n\nThe game of roullete is a classic casino gambling game. Players place their chips on the table until the croupier says no more bets. They will then watch as the ball lands in a number slot and are awarded according to their betting odds.\n\nSome players use various strategies to increase their chances of winning, but roulette is a game of chance and no amount of skill will guarantee a win.\n\nOrigin\n\nIt is unclear what exactly gave rise to roulette. There are numerous theories, including the belief that it was invented by 17th-century French physicist Blaise Pascal while he was trying to create a perpetual motion machine. Others claim that the game was derived from older games such as portique, hoca and bassette. Other games that could be considered precursors to roulette include roly poly and even-odd.\n\nThere is also the possibility that roulette was inspired by a game played by Roman soldiers. They used to spin shields that had symbols on them and place bets based on where the symbol would stop. Regardless, there is no proof that either of these ideas is true. The word 'roulette' itself probably comes from the Latin word rotella, meaning little wheel.\n\nVariations\n\nRoulette games are offered in a variety of variations, some with additional bets and special rules that add to the fun. Some games have higher house edges than others, and beginners should avoid those. If you're looking for the best payouts, consider roulette variations that offer high multipliers, like Lighting Roulette from Evolution Gaming, or those with bonus game features, like Triple Bonus Spin from IGT. The latter offers a 1:12,000 payout for straight bonus wins.", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "06b561f5-715a-485b-bc5f-f1fb2e184354", "url": "https://www.cchomeinspections.org/what-is-roulette-15/"}

By gathering insights into patient demographics, interests, and engagement patterns, healthcare organizations can create content that resonates with their audience and encourages active participation.\n\nVariety is key when it comes to content creation. Offering a mix of educational articles, infographics, videos, and interactive posts can cater to different learning styles and preferences. It's also important to strike a balance between promoting health-related information and fostering meaningful engagement. Encouraging patients to share their experiences, ask questions, and participate in discussions can create a sense of community and foster patient engagement.\n\nBy building trust and credibility while tailoring content to patient preferences, healthcare organizations can effectively engage patients through social media. These strategies, combined with timely responses to inquiries and comments, utilization of social media analytics, and integration of social media into the overall communication strategy, can maximize patient engagement and contribute to positive health outcomes.\n\nLeveraging Different Social Media Platforms\n\nIn the realm of healthcare marketing, leveraging different social media platforms is essential for engaging patients and reaching a wider audience. Each platform offers unique features and advantages that can be utilized to keep patients engaged and informed. Let's explore some of the popular social media platforms and their relevance in healthcare marketing.\n\nFacebook for Healthcare Organizations\n\nDespite recent concerns about privacy and data breaches, Facebook remains a prominent social media platform with a vast user base. It provides healthcare organizations with an opportunity to connect with patients, share informative content, and build a community. Facebook allows organizations to create dedicated pages where they can share updates, educational material, health tips, and patient success stories.

It emphasizes professional networking, credibility, and credibility-building. By maintaining an active presence on LinkedIn, healthcare organizations can establish themselves as industry leaders, attract top talent, and forge valuable partnerships.\n\nYouTube for Educational Videos\n\nYouTube's popularity as a video-sharing platform makes it an excellent choice for healthcare organizations to create and share educational videos, tutorials, patient testimonials, and expert interviews. By building a YouTube channel, organizations can establish themselves as thought leaders, expand their reach, and foster engagement. The platform allows for in-depth content creation, enabling healthcare organizations to provide valuable information and establish trust with their audience.\n\nBy leveraging the strengths of different social media platforms, healthcare organizations can effectively engage with patients, share relevant information, and establish themselves as trusted sources of healthcare knowledge. It's important for organizations to tailor their content to each platform and utilize the unique features offered to maximize their impact and keep patients engaged.\n\nStrategies for Keeping Patients Engaged\n\nTo ensure ongoing engagement with patients on social media platforms for healthcare, healthcare organizations should employ effective strategies. By responding to inquiries and comments, utilizing social media analytics, and integrating social media into their communication strategy, healthcare organizations can maintain a strong connection with their patients.\n\nResponding to Inquiries and Comments\n\nTimely and personalized responses to patient inquiries and comments are crucial for fostering engagement on social media. Patients are more likely to engage with healthcare organizations on social media when they perceive the content to be relevant and engaging and when they trust the source of the information [3]. By actively monitoring social media platforms and promptly responding to inquiries and comments, healthcare organizations can demonstrate their commitment to patient satisfaction and build trust and credibility.\n\nTo effectively manage inquiries and comments, healthcare organizations should establish clear protocols and designate staff members responsible for social media engagement. These designated individuals should be knowledgeable about the organization's services and policies, ensuring accurate and helpful responses. By addressing patient concerns and providing valuable information, healthcare organizations can enhance patient satisfaction and encourage ongoing engagement.\n\nUtilizing Social Media Analytics\n\nSocial media analytics provide valuable insights into patient preferences and engagement levels. By leveraging these analytics, healthcare organizations can better understand their target audience and tailor their content accordingly. Analytics can reveal which types of posts generate the most engagement, allowing organizations to focus on creating content that resonates with their patients.\n\nKey metrics to consider when analyzing social media engagement include likes, comments, shares, and clicks.

{"text": "Stieg Larsson Quotes (74 Quotes)\n\nWhat irritated her most was that they kept brushing off her arguments with patronizing smiles, making her feel like a teenager being quizzed on her homework. Without actually uttering a single inappropriate word, they displayed towards her an attitude that was so antediluvian it was almost comical. You shouldn't worry your pretty head over complex matters, little girl.—Stieg Larsson, \"The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest\"\n\nNo matter how hard she tried to concentrate on something else, to pass the time and to distract her from the situation she was in, the fear came trickling out. It hovered like a cloud of gas around her, threatening to penetrate her pores and poison her.—Stieg Larsson, \"The Girl Who Played With Fire\"\n\nThe Stock Exchange is something very different. There is no economy and no production of goods and services. There are only fantasies in which people from one hour to the next decide that this or that company is worth so many billions, more or less. It doesn't have a thing to do with reality or with the Swedish economy.—Stieg Larsson, \"The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo\"\n\nSalander's fingers emerged like something dead from beneath the earth. Had there been any human watching, he would probably have reacted like the fox. He was gone like a shot.—Stieg Larsson, \"The Girl Who Played With Fire\"\n\nI've had many enemies over the years. If there's one thing I've learned, it's never engage in a fight you're sure to lose. On the other hand, never let anyone who has insulted you get away with it. Bide your time and strike back when you're in a position of strength-even if you no longer need to strike back.—Stieg Larsson, \"The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo\"\n\nAlways retain the ability to walk away, without sentimentality, from a situation that felt unmanageable. That was a basic rule of survival. Don't lift a finger for a lost cause.—Stieg Larsson, \"The Girl Who Played With Fire\"\n\nMuch stronger boys in her class soon learned that it could be quite unpleasant to fight with that skinny girl. Unlike other girls in the class, she never backed down, and she would not for a second hesitate to use her fists or any weapon at hand to protect herself. She went around with the attitude that she would rather be beaten to death than take any shit.—Stieg Larsson, \"The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo\"\n\nHis attitude had always been that if a woman clearly indicated that she did not want anything more to do with him, he would go on his way. Not respecting such a message would in his eyes, show a lack of respect for her.—Stieg Larsson, \"The Girl Who Played With Fire\"\n\nNormally seven minutes of another person's company was enough to give her a headache so she set things up to live as a recluse. She was perfectly content as long as people left her in peace. Unfortunately society was not very smart or understanding.—Stieg Larsson, \"The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo\"\n\nSalander leaned back against the pillow and followed the conversation with a smile. She wondered why she, who had such difficulty talking about herself with people of flesh and blood, could blithely reveal her most intimate secrets to a bunch of completely unknown freaks on the Internet.—Stieg Larsson, \"The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest\"\n\nHer absence had felt like torture--almost a form of personal punishment. He had nobody to discuss his feelings with, and for the first time he realised with appalling clarity what a destructive hold she had over him.—Stieg Larsson, \"The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "36a6459d-aadb-41d3-883e-8cc2bf0419aa", "url": "https://www.inspirationalstories.com/quotes/t/stieg-larsson/"}

{"text": "What is a good sequest ht score?\n\nWhat is a good sequest htWhat is a decoy database?\n\nThe decoy sequence database contains biologically nonexistent sequences that share some statistical attributes with the target sequences. Ideally, random peptide spectrum matches (PSMs) are expected to hit both the decoy and the target sequences with the same probabilistic distributions.\n\nWhat is Q value in proteomics?\n\nQ-values are the name given to the adjusted p-values found using an optimised FDR approach. In what follows, I will tie up some ideas and hopefully this will help clarify what we have been saying about p and q values. It is usual to test many hundreds or thousands of protein variables in a proteomics experiment.\n\nWhat is a good mascot score?\n\nFor a positive protein identification, the mascot score has to be above the 95% confidence level. For a database search in the nrbd protein database from NCBI containing 18 million known protein sequence, the 95% confidence level is around a Score of 90 [1, 2].\n\nWhat is a decoy peptide?\n\nPeptide decoys or decoy receptors are molecules specifically designed to mimic the role of a certain receptor protein, encouraging target entities to interact with them so that these interactions can be studied and analyzed, or even exploited to initiate a certain activity or response.\n\nWhat is Q-value the confidence level in Sequest HT?\n\nSEQUEST HT is the name of the employed search engine. The confidence level associated with the identification of the peptide group. A green circle indicates high confidence, a yellow circle indicated medium confidence, and a red circle indicates low confidence.\n\nHow does Sequest work to determine match uniqueness?\n\nIn addition, SEQUEST exports the normalized difference between the best and the second- best scores (delta Cn), which is useful to determine match uniqueness relative to near misses for a given database.\n\nHow does xcorr Sequest calculate cross correlation score?\n\n• XCorr Sequest HT: scores the number of fragment ions that are common to two different peptides with the same precursor mass and calculates the cross-correlation score for all candidate peptides queried from the database. 11/19/2019 PSMstab\n\nPost navigation\n\nWhat is a good sequest HTHow Sequest works?\n\nSequest identifies each tandem mass spectrum individually. The software evaluates protein sequences from a database to compute the list of peptides that could result from each.\n\nHow do you read Mascot search results?\n\nFor each protein match, Mascot calculates an overall Protein Score. This number reflects the combined scores of all observed mass spectra that can be matched to amino acid sequences within that protein. A higher score indicates a more confident match. A mass spectrometry experiment never produces \"perfect\" data.\n\nIs MaxQuant free?\n\nMaxQuant is freely available and can be downloaded from this site. The download includes the search engine andromeda, which is integrated into MaxQuant as well as the viewer application for inspection of raw data and identification and quantification results.\n\nWhat is PSM in mass spec?\n\nA peptide-spectrum match (PSM) scoring function assigns a numerical value to a peptide-spectrum pair (P,S) expressing the likelihood that the fragmentation of a peptide with sequence P is recorded in the experimental mass spectrum S.\n\nWhat is a pep score?\n\nThe PEP score is the probability that a peptide (PSM-peptide spectral match) is incorrect. The Sequest score is a calculation that scores and sums each peptide for a given protein. Basically, the higher the score the more confidence you can have that the given peptide identification is correct.\n\nWhat does a Mascot score mean?\n\nThe Mascot score for a protein is the summed score for the individual peptides, e.g. peptide masses and peptide fragment ion masses, for all peptides matching a given protein. For a positive protein identification, the mascot score has to be above the 95% confidence level.\n\nWhat does a Mascot represent?\n\n: a person, animal, or object used as a symbol to represent a group (such as a sports team) and to bring good luck.\n\nHow can I speed up my MaxQuant?\n\nYou can increase the number of processors or threads (depending upon the MaxQuant version you re using) to speed up the MaxQuant processing. In general, one thread needs 2GB of RAM for processing, so if your computer has 8GB RAM, you can increase the number of processors to 4.\n\nWhat is Q value a peptide score?\n\nSpecifically, the ratio of the protein score and number of non-redundant peptides, or average peptide score (APS), can facilitate initial filtering of database search results in addition to providing a useful measure of confidence for the proteins identified.\n\nWhat is the meaning of protein score?\n\nProtein scores For a search that contains a small number of queries, the protein score is the sum of the highest ions score for each distinct sequence.\n\nXCorr Sequest HT: scores the number of fragment ions that are common to two different peptides with the same precursor mass and calculates the cross-correlation score for all candidate peptides queried from the database.\n\nHow is the Sequest tool used in proteomics?\n\nSequest identifies collections of tandem mass spectra to peptide sequences that have been generated from databases of protein sequences. This tool is most useful in the context of proteomics. Starting with a complex mixture of proteins, this strategy typically employs trypsin to digest proteins.\n\nWhat is the name of the protein score?\n\nScore SEQUEST HT. The protein score which is calculated by summing the individual scores of each peptide. The higher this score, the higher the individual scores of the peptides, and thus the better the identification. SEQUEST HT is the name of the employed search engine. # Peptides SEQUEST HT.", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "abf3f7a1-d513-46bb-be85-6ca67d4a0bdf", "url": "https://corporatetaxratenow.com/what-is-a-good-sequest-ht-score/"}
