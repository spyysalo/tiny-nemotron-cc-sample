{"text": "Bible of the Devil is set to have its sixth album released on Tuesday, May 8th, 2012, via Rome, Italy based label Cruz Del Sur Music.\n\nVeteran Chicago Rock n' Roll band Bible of the Devil have announced the completion of their sixth full-length album and third for Rome, Italy, based label Cruz Del Sur Music. Entitled \"For the Love of Thugs and Fools\", Bible of the Devil's eagerly anticipated follow-up to their 2008 release,\" Freedom Metal\", is an assembly\"For the Love of Thugs and Fools\" is viewed by the band as a document of the many characters they have encountered through the life of the band, whether it be in love, loss, friendship, or hatred. Having toured extensively throughout the United States and Europe since the band's inception in late 1999 and living in the volatile urban environment Chicago, where encounters with crime, violence, and 'street justice' are unavoidable, there has been much subject matter for the band to draw from. Embracing the philosophy that a bottle of whiskey and some loud guitar is often the best cure available for these challenges and ordeals, Bible of the Devil have chosen to document their grievances in the form of one devastating Rock n' Roll platter. Said singer/guitarist Mark Hoffmann, \"The few years since the last full-length have been like a dare. A dare to create a soaring, punishing Rock n' Roll record of this magnitude. It is a dare that we have been forced to answer ourselves.\" Fans of Bible of the Devil can expect yet another collection of fist-pumping heavy guitar classics-in-the-making, For the Love of Thugs and Fools.\n\nAlso, check out BOTD's own Mark Hoffmann in this week's Chicago reader as he interviews the band Ghost. Please note as the release date says April 10th, but due a distributor issue the official release is May 8th.

It lets you remove a large plethora of apps, while the others can be removed manually.

(e.g. Dell Diagnostics will check both RAM & the hard drive)\nAnother test you can do to see if it is software related.\nGo to MSConfig from the run command Click Services tab and Disable all then go to Startup and Disable all. Then boot up and see if there is still a delay.\nIf not then you can go in and slowly start to enable things in small groups to see when it begins to slow down.\n\nRe: Win 7 slow boot.\n\nIf not then you can go in and slowly start to enable things in small groups to see when it begins to slow down..\n\nRe: Win 7 slow boot.\n\nOriginally Posted by Adamsappleone.?\n\nI have done it both ways. Doing it one at a time is the best way to effectively find out which one affected you. But I never had the time to reboot a computer over 60 times while the customer was being billed by the hour. My clients would of had a heart attack. If I broke that down in logical groups I could save hours. The hard part was to make sure you knew what items you just turned off, because the minute you found the problem group, you would have to turn it back off and go one at a time. But what I would do is kind of a hybrid, I would start quickly the things that I was pretty confident were not the issue in groups and then go one at a time w/ the rest. But for the average home user, I agree that they should just do it one at a time. Just put on some good music or something first, cause it will take you a while. :-)\n\nRe: Win 7 slow boot.Re: Win 7 slow boot.\n\nOriginally Posted by tanzanosWhat kind of computer is it?

The video was directed by Bill Fishman (The Ramones, Steve Ray Vaughan). Check it out below.\n\nOne of the most anticipated progressive metal albums of the year, Dream Theater's new self-titled album, is already streaming online in its entirety. What?

The wait is almost over.\n\nDream Theater's last album, 2011's A Dramatic Turn Of Events, earned the band its first Grammy nomination and was the first without founding member and drummer Mike Portnoy. Now with their new album Dream Theater, new drummer Mike Mangini was involved in the songwriting process. You can now listen to their new single \"The Enemy Inside\" here and see what the band has to offer this time around.\n\nThe suspense is over, Dream Theater fans.

{"text": " average needs to be upgraded but you get what you pay for. Carpet smells bad and the room is very average, I would not stay here again did not meet my expectations. We did have a nice ocean view from our room.\n\nI live locally in Miami and I know there are so many places to choose from but I had family in from out of town and wanted to stay on beach. I needed a place for 6 guests without having to get a second room and Best Western had that at a fair price. We checked in without problem asked for 4 keys only recieved 2. They did not work in garage door or opener. The parking garage is creepy and I would be very nervous to go in there by myself as a grown woman. The parking spots are way to small unless you have a smart car. I was scared to leave because I knew I would find a bigger spot. We had called ahead to see if we needed beach towels and they said no because BW supplied yellow towels but they were never available. I waited for over an hour, asked 4 staff, went to the desk and finally someone brought them to the pool for us. In 3 days I never saw clean yellow towels in container. The overall hotel just looks run down the pool area bar seemed dirty and old. My kids said cool lets play chess but the pieces were broken and missing. Our cards repeatly kept not working and we must have had them fixed at the front desk 4 times and we made sure that we did not keep them by the phones and other credit cards. The first night we had no sheets for the sofa beds for my sons. Must have called 5 times and then finally over 1 hr and half someone dropped them off. coffee pot did not work you had to hold it up for it to drain the coffee it was like the lid did not fit the pot. One of the remotes for TV did not have batteries and we called and asked housekeeping, no one ever brought them but then hey its just batteries right. The first day the cleaning ladies wanted to clean room at 10am but the teenagers were still sleeping. We all all left at noon and purposely stayed out till about 430-5pm to come back and find room not cleaned. We had to call for someone to clean. I took all the trash cans and towels and put them by door to help out. She left us 3 new towels for a family of six. I did not even call back, not worth it annoyed at this point. Its all about the little things and too many of the little things add up and made this just not a great experience. The folks at front desk were always very courteous but it just seemed understaffed for support help not sure. Unfortunately I wont be back. Just too many other choices on the beach. The only positive things for the hotel would be the beds were comfy, there was hot water which in the reviews some say there was not, and you did have a restaurant on site, we did not use though, the gym is actual very well equipped and my sons loved it. Your hotel is in such a hot location and rt down from Fontainebleau, and it has such potential. It could be so much better.\n\nStayed Augustthis hotel is in great location , better arrival on time or call for reserv parking before you go , make sure or ask they dont do construction on any floors , i recomended the ocean front view is pretty .\n\nWe enjoyed our family stay at this hotel. The suite had plenty of room for the 6 of us. It was great having a kitchenette, as breakfast was not included in the rate. The location was very convenient, and we will be back.\n\nLimited parking space at the hotel, had to park at the local garage two blocks down. Poor customer service at the check-in. No complimetnary breakfast. Not one person did have a smile on their face of nice word. I had a feeling that even good morning was too much for them to say. Maintenance person at the pool not frinedly. Poor room service. Overall, not friendly hotel.Your review is very concerning to me as we take customer service very seriously with all of our staff. We also offer extensive training on the subject matter to ensure that every guest has a wonderful experience while here. I apologize that you felt you were not given the treatment you most definitely deserve. I have addressed this with all staff to make sure that incidents such as this not re-occur. I also would like to apologize if there was a misunderstanding regarding breakfast. Our hotel does not offer complimentary breakfast. However, we do have a full service restaurant that offers continental and full American breakfast at a reasonable cost to all of our guests. I want to thank you for choosing to stay at the Best Western Atlantic Beach Resort and assure you that all of your comments have been addressed. We hope you will give us another opportunity on your next visit. Best regards,\n\nBarbara Romano General Manager\n\nReport response as inappropriate\nThank you. We appreciate your input.\n\nThis response is the subjective opinion of the management representative and not of TripAdvisor LLC.\n\nJust recently my Husband & I stayed at the Best Western Atlantic Beach Resort for a day & a half after our cruise trip last Monday. From the moment we walked in into the lobby & proceeded to the concierge, we were greeted with such warm hospitality & big smiles! We were given our rooms within 15 minutes which was on the 6th floor towards the rear of the hotel with an amazing view of Miami Beach! Having read the poor reviews from other guests that have stayed here, we truly have nothing negative to report about this charmer! The accomodations, cleaniness & location is wonderful, but the staff & management is why we will definitely book this hotel in the near future when we return to Miami Beach! We also had breakfast at the Aqua restaurant following day located next to the lobby. The omlettes made fresh were delicious! We found the presentation & quality of the food very satisfying! We also had the honor of meeting the General Manager Barbara Romano simply because we wanted to thank her for running such a splendid hotel, also because us as Canadians, we always acknowlegde superior customer service when we experience it! Having known about this hotel prior to our cruise trip, we wish we would have stayed here beforehand instead of that tragic little Whitelaw hotel! C'est la vie!\n\nRoom Tip: Room 612 was our room & we'd definitely recommend it! Just with the amazing view of the ocea...Thank you so much for your review and for giving the Hotel an opportunity despite some negative reviews. We have so many guests that we encounter on a daily basis that say the same thing about ignoring the reviews and giving us a try. I'm so glad you were one of them. Our staff strives to make each guests stay a memorable one and we are continuously making changes for the better to our hotel. I am glad we were able to make the last days of your vacation a great one.\n\nThank you again for choosing to stay at the Best Western Atlantic Beach Resort.

{"text": "Resort Overview\n\nThe Regnum Carya Resort is the newest addition to the golf hotels in Belek when it opens in early 2014. Designed alongside the 16th and 17th fairways of the Carya Golf Course, you may even be able to slice your tee shots onto your own balcony!! With ownership of the already hugely popular Carya golf course, the Regnum Carya Golf and Spa Resort is a true 5* addition to the hotels on offer in Belek, Antalya. Featuring a luxury all inclusive concept, the beverage list on offer is of an excellent quality. The brand new hotel offers a range of different dining facilities to choose from, including 4 a la carte restaurants. The rooms are spacious and the bathrooms feature a double sink as standard. The design itself looks both modern and tasteful, creating a relaxed atmosphere, whilst still maintaining its high class feel. The Regnum Carya Golf Resort has a large Spa, with a wonderful array of treatments to indulge in after your round of golf. For those of you who are familiar with Cornelia Diamond the Regnum is pitched at a higher level of quality and on about the same levels of excellence as Gloria Serenity Resort. This is a great new option in Belek for a great Turkey Golf Resort. Residents will enjoy great packages including golf and great times on National, Carya and Cornelia Faldo.\n\nLocation\n\nThe Regnum Carya is located in the middle section of Belek alongside the16th and 17th holes of the Carya Course, it is also very adjacent to the Sueno Pines and Dunes course and is 45 minutes transfer from Antalya airport.\n\nAccommodation\n\nScheduled to be opened in April 2014, Regnum Carya Golf & Spa Resort is located inside 178.000 m2 area surrounded by pine trees of Carya Golf Club. Having been designed with a perfect architecture, the hotel integrates the relaxing green shades of golf with the exciting blueness of Mediterranean Sea. Featuring totally 1200 beds, the hotel is getting ready to become the most ambitious hotel of the region with new products and projects. The hotel encompasses 8 different room types in a total of 530 rooms\n\nDining at Regnum Carya Resort\n\nGourmet Main Restaurant - The restaurant serves in open buffet concept for breakfast, late breakfast, lunch and dinner with its stylish decoration and rich food corners. The restaurant features indoor and terrace part, separate kids restaurant, baby station and diet corner. The buffets are so good at the Regnum Carya, they are themed so there is change every night giving plenty of variety and choice.\n\nThe Seahorse (Seafood), The Ottoman (Turkish), Tramonto (Italian) and Chufang (Far East) A la Carte restaurants, all with innovative designs, fine cuisine and service, married up with super wine lists! When eating in the a la carte restaurants there is a supplement of €25 per person which is payable locally.\n\nREGNUM CARYA GOLF&SPA RESORT\n\nGolf Course\n\nThe most popular and classic golf course in Belek over the last few years, Carya is a magnificent test of golf, laid out through majestic umbrella pine trees, the fairways are generous and simply superb in terms of condition, the last 6 holes are a brilliant stretch of holes - the course is never over difficult, but at the same time never easy, simply exceptionally fair test of golf with slick putting surfaces. The clubhouse at Carya is top class and boasts an exceptional Pro-Shop and driving range on two tiers. The new hotel runs alongside the right hand side of holes 16 and 17. Arguably Belek's finest course these days it certainly rivals PGA Sultan for top spot.\n\nWe really enjoyed our holiday at the Regnum Carya, thank you. It was a good recommendation and was certainly on a par with the Gloria Serenity. The holiday was lovely, the Carya golf club is a favourite with us and Matrix were their usual efficient selves on the airport transfers and when we went to the PGA Sultan course.

A non iron shirt from the dryer requires an immediate removal from a low-heat dry cycle after a warm wash cycle. i don't know what they did, but if they state they did as instructed, i would have doubts unless i saw it myself. this is a great value for its price...in fact, an excellent value for its price. i will buy other colors, i just wished the tailored fit came with other patterns that were a bit more dressy or conservative.\nJune 24, 2014\n\nNice shirt, fits well, good value\nMy son (age 20) likes this shirt for his summer job. It's been laundered at home a few times and the \"No Iron\" is holding up so far. He likes the tailored fit, preferring it to another shirt he got in the slim fit, even though he is pretty slim.\nJune 23, 2014\n\nGood for slender man\nVery nice shirt but had to send back for regular fit.

{"text": "It's been a while since we heard anything from the Nike Chuck Posite – that angular new shoe that is the latest in a long line of Nike Sportswear models that extend the signature life of certain athletes. The pair is pictured here with a rather \"South Beach\" looking palette and a hefty helping of reflective material. We'd hoped that Nike would put the South Beach theme to rest now that LeBron has made his exodus from Miami, but this Posite pair has something to say about that. Get a better look at the shoes after the break and then check out the price on this sample from prince_m818 on eBay.\n\nThe Nike Barkley Posite Max \"USA\" will release on August 1st, 2014. The shoe is dripping with patriotic flavor between the starry perforations place on the upper and the red, white, and blue treatment that shows up for the lining (one that should look familiar to those of you who remember Nike Sportswear's USA offerings from earlier in the summer). They're a little late for an Independence Day tie-in, but these still to drum up excitement for the 2014 FIBA World Cup that's taking place in a few short weeks. Get a better look at this new Nike Barkley Posite Max below and stick with us for more updates on this surprising release.\n\nThe Nike Air Flightposite should continue to satisfy fans of the slept on shoe in 2014 with this \"Copper\" pair that's on its way. They've got a decent amount of overlap with the old \"Metallic Gold\" colorway, but this pair looks quite a bit shinier and it blacks out the midfoot support piece that creeps in to break up the upper (They've also got icy soles on the bottom this time). Continue reading to get a better look at this upcoming Foamposite sneaker and check back in on Sneaker News to get the first word on a release date for them.\n\nThe Nike Barkley Posite Max looks to be making a return in 2014 as we get a first look at a new Premium-level model dubbed \"USA\". On a brand new White/Black/Navy colorway, this Posite-built Barkley hybrid model features star perforations on the upper, replacing the circular holes associated with the Nike Air Max 2 CB '94. The sockliner also features the \"USA\" graphic seen in Air Force 1 and Blazer Mid releases from a month ago. Check out another teaser shot below, and stay tuned for a full reveal as a release date for August 1st has been reported.\n\nIt seems that Nike has paused for a minute on the graphic Foamposite pairs. While that might satisfy Posite pursuits, those same purists no doubt have something to say about the Nike Air Foamposite One \"Black Suede\" shown here. The sneakers are indeed releasing – August 29th is their date of arrival. The shoes sort of undo the indestructible aura of the sneakers by planting a slightly more weather-vulnerable material on the upper. Find more \"Black Suede\" Foam photos below and register your thoughts on them in the comments.\n\nThe Nike Air Foamposite One \"Black Suede\" release date is August 29th, 2014. While the sneakers have no doubt angered some with their less than OG build, they do show a stronger commitment to the blackout look than the previous \"Stealth\" pair. Here the sole isn't quite so icy, and instead has a smoky anthracite coloring to it. Will this Foamposite pair be a success, or is the world not yet ready for another black-based pair so soon? Give us your predictions after you check out the rest of the photos for the Nike Air Foamposite One \"Black Suede\" below.\n\nThe Nike Hyperposite is a sneaker that's had a longer life in the PE realm than it has in the retail one. As far as we can tell, the shoe won't be showing up on sneaker shelves anymore (They've already moved on to that sequel in the works). One of the more recent pairs doled out to Swoosh NBA athletes was this Sacramento Kings flavored joint for Rudy Gay. The pair has a palette that of course lines up with that team and a camo touch on top.

Clayton area is one of our favorites in North GA due to its proximity to NC and SC and there's so much to see and do. Cabin was cozy, comfortable, clean, had everything we needed and our home away from home for the week. We loved sitting on the porch with a view every afternoon and relaxing. We didn't realize the cabin had a washer/dryer until we got there! Nice plus! We highly recommend using Wildwater, Ltd. for your rafting trips - we've used them on every river they raft and they do a great job. We did Section IV of the Chattooga which was definitely on our bucket list. Also Yonah Vineyards, Tiger Mountain Vineyards and 12 Spies made for a great wine tasting afternoon. Many waterfalls and hikes in the area. This cabin's location is close to it all plus the quaint town of Clayton. Check it out - you'll have a great time!\n\nBeautiful Cabin with Beautiful Fall Mountain Views\n\n5 of 5\n\nMy wife and I stayed at this cozy, warm and comfortable cabin for a much needed restful four days. It was a wonderful place to stay. The back porch with the swing and rocking chairs overlooking the beautiful mountain view was outstanding. That is exactly what I needed. The weather was perfect, chilly days and cold nights. So I got me a hot cup of coffee, a good book and the swing. Looking at those beautiful Fall colors was amazing. We took in the sights and shops of Clayton and Dillard and rode around taking in the breathtaking colors of Fall. However we loved coming back to the coziness of the cabin and just feeling surrounded by the warmth of it all. It was a wonderful place to stay. We will definitely plan to return.\n\nSubmitted: Nov 25 visiting our home away from home and appreciating what the mountains are really all about: relaxing in a comfortable, cozy environment and taking time to enjoy the view, the mountain people and the surrounding culture. Please do visit with us again.\n\nExcellent Experience\n\n5 of 5\n\nHi Dale,\n\nWe stayed at your cabin right at the peak of the fall season. My husband is originally from Raybun County, but it was my first time to visit the South. It was one of best experiences we've ever had! We had plenty of room for all of our family, the cabin was very neat and clean, and the view was breathtaking. The last night we stayed, we had the windows opened and slept to a light rain all night long. It was a perfectly peaceful ending to a wonderful stay. We hope to come back next November to stay at your cabin again. Thank-you for the wonderful memories.\n\nA Great Relaxing Weekend\n\n4 of 5\n\nLog Perch is a great cabin for a get-away to the mountains. It is conveniently located to Clayton, Lake Burton, Dillard, and many other areas that we didn't have time to explore during our three-day weekend. It was a pleasure to work with Dale, the owner, in reserving the cabin. She answered all of our questions and sent us a list of restaurants, attractions, and things to do in the area. The cabin was spotless when we arrived and was well-furnished. A very positive overall experience.\n\nOwner's Response: Randy, I so appreciate your feedback. It is always helpful to know what people like, and what they don't, so we can be more hospitable. We love that little cabin and want others to enjoy it as well. Thanks so much for staying with us and please do come again.\n\nLog Perch and a fishing trip\n\n5 of 5\n\nMy 2 sons and I had a great time just being in the quiet, peaceful atmosphere. I think our last guys trip was maybe 20 years ago (long over due). How easy it was for us to enjoy each others company and to see God at work in ours lives and nature. Fishing in the area was good. Fish and relax was the order of the day. Absolutely beautiful and just what we needed. Thanks for make such a place available.\n\nSubmitted: May 13, 2012\n\nStayed: May 2012\n\nSource:\nHomeAway\n\nRecommended for:\nAge 55+,\nGirls Getaway,\nRomantic Getaway\n\nOwner's Response: Thanks so much, Earl, for this wonderful feedback about Log Perch. It is always a pleasure to hear from folks who enjoy our cabin and the surrounding area as much as we do. So glad you had this opportunity with your sons. Made my husband want to gather our two back up and plan a trip.

{"text": "UPDATED: MAY 9, 2011 On tap at DLD. I thought this and the Heaven Hill on tap were very similar. This poured black with a nice heavy brown head. One whiff and youíll never believe your nose. In fact, the aroma is completely other-worldly. Heavy vanilla with a strong bourbon back bone, coffee, sweet caramel, molasses, licorice, chocolate cake, and deeper more cocoa aroma. There are so many layers of complexity, itís incredible. The beer is almost soft and velvety yet entirely enveloping of the palate. Full flavors of bourbon and vanilla unequivocally dominate both the nose and the palate. Underneath are wonderful complexities of moist chocolate cake, roasted coffee - but not bitter roast. Molasses, caramel, licorice, even tobacco and oak. Yet dark fruits like raisins and plums, maybe some dates just really make this incredible. Thick, oily, and heavy. What a beer!\n\nDLDí11. Finally got to try this, and boy did it live up to the hype. Oily black pour, thin espresso tan head. Aroma is thick of vanilla, chocolate, coffee, roast, some nice candied dark fruit, touch of the barrel in there. Taste is perfect, and not overly sweet like I thought it might be. Big notes of vanilla up front, but the coffee and bitter bakerís chocolate compliment it perfectly, some other sweet dark fruits in there finishing roasty and bitter, with a perfectly mouth coating body without being too oily. Doesnít get much better!\n\nEvery once in a while I look around and think, \"I am seriously drinking this?\" Last night was like that for about 6 hours. Thanks ___, for this, you know who you are.\nServed side by side with DL 2009 and Oak aged DL 2010. Served in a tulip. Beer is about as youíd expect a DL to look but this version had no head or lacing. The beer left some legs on the glass, pitch black, even at the corners. Beer coats the glass as I swirl. Super thick and pitch black. Amazing.\nThis beer has the most obvious aroma of any beer Iíve had in a long long time. STRONG vanilla, like baking vanilla. Some chocolate, strong, complex aroma.\nMouthfeel on this beer is huge and thick but the sweetness of the vanilla (super sweet) makes it seem lighter some how. This is an aggressively awesome beer -- my favorite out of the three by a lot. It tastes like a vanilla cake...or flan...or some kind of dessert with fudge and vanilla. I couldnít drink much of it without my insulin spiking but I canít wait for DL day 2011.\nServing type: growler\n\nI had this on tap at dld. Thanks to Mario for getting in for us all... The look is nothing of note, black nice tan head...This beer is all about the aroma and the taste. Tons of awesome vanilla on the nose a little light coffee. The taste just brings the vanilla to the whole new level. Super sweet tons of awesome vanilla that is really nicely balanced. This is the best vanilla Iíve ever had. Only wish I could have more of this.\n\nholy, crap! just found my notes on this one scratched on the back cover of my notebook from DLD í09 that I havenít seen in almost 2 years, haha. and wow were my notes profound...\"fuck! itís like regular Dark Lord dipped in diabetes! awesome! just...too...sweet! that about sums it up, i think. great in very, very small amounts.\n\n6.3oz. handbottle with another huge thanks to StFun! Pours blacks with a slight center forming head of loose and large bubbles and settles to a thin ring. Aroma is not quite and complex or intense as the OADL, but very rich and lovely with vanilla bean, chocolate, oak, caramel and some dried dark fruits. Flavor is definitely on the sweeter side, with more rich vanilla, bittersweet chocolate, dried dark fruits, caramel and oak. Toes the line nicely between sweet and a sticky mess. Minimal carbonation with a nice smooth and almost syrupy mouthfeel. Another nice dessert beer sipper, and great stuff but would take the OADL over this any day. Thanks again Josh. much appreciated!\n\nNip hand bottle, courtesy a great RB trading friend. 2009 vintage released at 2010 DLD. This one pours an impenetrable black body with hints of mahogany at the edges and topped by as minimal head of film. The dense, oily body leaves sheeting stains on the glass. It looks like it means business. The nose is super rich and decadently sweet, more so than anything else I have smelled in a beer. Rich chocolate cake, syrup, vanilla bean, and toasted marshmallows come across, smooth, sweet, and just like a nice dessert. The bourbon and oak barely come through as the intense vanilla dominates everything. The flavors are just as huge with rich, dark chocolate and toasted vanilla marshmallows come across in a símores like fashion. The barrel comes through a bit more with soft whiskey and oak adding depth, but very little roast to balance out the intense sweetness from the chocolate and vanilla. The mouthfeel is thick, oily, and round and coats everything inside the mouth. Minimal carbonation as expected and a lingering toasted vanilla finish. Really decadent and great tasting beer in smaller doses. The nip bottle was more than enough for 2 of us. Still a great beer, and one that I am really glad to have tried.\n\nJoin us!

The first-class service provided by Royal Westmoreland is a truly unforgettable experience.\n\nAll guests staying in Royal Westmoreland have access to the resort facilities which include flood lit tennis courts, gym, communal pool and a Kid's Club which is open at peak times during the year.\n\nThe Saint James Parish region\n\nBarbados is a coral island formed in pre-historic times by erupting volcanoes. Now it is a dream for beachgoers, scuba divers, snorkelers, golfers, fishing enthusiasts and just about anyone seeking fun and relaxation in a relatively upmarket environment. You can even go to the horse races and polo matches if you desire. Its west coast boasts beaches of fine white sand bordering a blue-green Caribbean sea, while the Atlantic Ocean supplies the east coast with waves that inspire surfers and other water sports enthusiasts.\n\nThe island is mostly flat and you can walk for miles along unbroken white sand beaches, sometimes stopping at a cluster of coral rocks jutting out to sea. However the hills, deep rifts and gullies found on the island provide a scenic home to colourful and interesting plants and wildlife.

Plenty of restaurants and music places brighten up the nightlife.\n\nSt. Lawrence Gap\n\nThis is a 1.3 km stretch of road, much of which is pedestrianised, in the parish of ChristChurch.

{"text": "I like this jean a lot. It fits well, soft and comfortable, and not too thick or heavy nor too thin and flimsy. I like the bleached patterns, too. Personally I think tie-dye is a little too much and a little too obvious, and this is the perfect alternative to that. It has different depth in colors, and look much more natural than tie-dye. One thing I am not 100% satisfied is that it is a little too long and 97% people who have normal length legs have to fold them once/twice more to achieve the desired length, and that makes the bottom part a little heavier and bulkier. The folded parts get flattens after one or two wear and looks okay , but definitely something worth to mention.\n\nNice jeans. Straight and long. But they proved me small. These tight jeans in my waist. They lack in the volume of 3-4 cm\nI do not know who wrote that they were more than they expected. But for me they are clearly small! A very sorry - it's very beautiful jeans\nAt the waist and hips 70 cm 94 cm the best fit size 28.\nFor me, the size was too small 27.\n\nWonderful jeans for this price. The fabric is thicker and not as stretchy as some other jeans but the pattern is just great fun. They even fit shorter frames like me (5'3 in height and 63kgs) in size 28 that I have ordered.\n\nI purchased these jeans on sale plus a 1 day 20% off. I'm so glad I did. Not only were they a great bargain but they look fabulous on me. I'm usually a 28 and I purchased a 27 since I hate when my jeans stretch and get loose on me. It was a little tight in the waist but other than that thye fit me just fine. For the price I paid I have absolutely NO complaints.\n\nso bummed...i am between a 27 and 28 in most brands...based on previous reviews I ordered a 27, and what i really needed was a 29...not at all boyfriend or relax fit at all...and with the sale the 29 was gone by the time i received...oh well\ngood luck... :(\n\nI waited to get these on sale because I wasn't sure about them - but I am REALLY happy I bought them. I am always a size 27 in jeans (if they are not defective). As you wear these they do stretch out a bit (they are not \"stretch\" denim, but they become a bit baggier as you wear them). I could have fit the 26 if I wanted a tighter fit, but as I wore the 27's they did become looser towards the end of the day. I am 5ft4\" and they hit/cover my ankle area with the cuff rolled up (not exposing the ankle like the model pictured). They look great with booties and a leather jacket, very stylish and cool. Snap them up - you cant go wrong for the price.\n\nI am so in love with these shorts. I always order up in shorts but these are the exception. The 28 fit because of the stretchiness but I wanted a smaller pair, so I ordered the 27 and kept both. Honestly I almost believe the 26 would work too. Regardless of the size discrepancy they are my favorite summer shorts. The color is cool and matches black or white shirt and they can be dressed up or down. The studs on the back pocket add to the adorableness of the short! I definitely recommend, just keep the size in mind & order down!\n\nI love these shorts!! They are pretty stretchy so it's not that they are necessarily bigger than expected, but I could definitlely fit in a size down and be completely fine. Buying in your normal size would be perfect too. It's just if you want a very snug fit, then go a size down. They are so soft, comfortable, edgy, and totally wearable. Take advantage of these before they are gone!!", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "593aeecf-e1bf-4c3f-8108-5939327da75e", "url": "http://www.shopbop.com/actions/reviews/seeAllBrandReviews.action?baseIndex=1185&folderID=2534374302153272"}

Room size is big and comfort. Pricing... compare to the neighbour hotel, this is not worth.\n\na rough start- i had a prepaid King Deluxe non-smoking room. i arrived to be told they were out of rooms of my booking and had either a smoking room or a twin room. the front desk was lovely, but could not explain the problem other that to say that was how it was. i was not terribly impressed but i opted for the twin room as a smoking room was NOT acceptable.\nthe room was average, paint peeling, the shower did not drain so after about 90 seconds the water pooled across the floor. shower time was VERY limited. i was not the only one on my floor that had the shower issue. saving grace was that is was only for one night then i was moved to the room i had already booked. the bathroom and all walls need cosmetic work, paint is peeling, there are scuffs and knicks, but the shower drained. so that was a plus. it was clean, comfortable, quiet. beds are comfortable, as are the pillows. breakfast is HUGE and varied. in the evenings there is a happy hour that has some food and inexpensive drinks. according to the website, the latest late-checkout is 6 pm. my flight was at midnight. i requested the late check out at the time of reservation, and again at check in but was told the latest would be 1 pm.\non the plus sides, the pool is a refreshing retreat. the location is great. near Centara convention centre, Grand Central shopping, the BTS.\nthe staff could not be lovelier. so helpful and all smiles, a pleasure coming back to be greeted so warmly.\ni would give the hotel a 4, merely because it needs some cosmetic help, and for the number of hotels in Bangkok, i think one could do better from that standpoint. however, the staff more than make up for that. as does the great breakfast, the food and drinks available poolside or in the lobby restaurant. and the street food all out front on the roads is not to be missed either.\n\nLocation(opposite Platinum wholesale and lots of day and night markets around), Nice,big and clean room and last but not least, helpful and efficient staffs\n\n7.7\n\nIt was great though we have some 'not so nice experience' on our first night stay in the first room on the executive level.

{"text": "ARBERTH, PA -- (Marketwire) -- 12/18/12 -- Royal Bancshares of Pennsylvania, Inc. (NASDAQ: RBPAA) today announced that F. Kevin Tylus has been named president, chief executive officer and a director of the bank, effective immediately. He will report directly to the board of directors.\n\nToday's announcement completes a management transition plan that was first announced by Royal in April 2012. Robert R. Tabas, who has served as chief executive officer since 2009, will retire from day-to-day management of the bank and holding company, but will remain as chairman of the board of directors.\n\nMr. Tylus was president of Yardville National Bank from 2004 to 2007, and served on the company's board of directors from 1991 to 2004, continuing as a non-independent director through 2007. During his tenure as president, Yardville expanded its footprint to 35 branches in New Jersey and Bucks County, PA, grew to $3 billion in assets, while market capitalization nearly doubled from its 2002 public stock offering. He also brings extensive capital markets experience, having worked with investment bankers and investors on a range of successful capital raising initiatives. He also was responsible for establishing an enterprise risk management culture, satisfying regulatory requirements and expanding customer-facing and internal technology capabilities. Mr. Tylus chaired several Board committees during his tenure as an independent director including the Strategic Planning Committee.\n\nAfter the sale of Yardville, Mr. Tylus remained with PNC as regional president of its newly-created Central New Jersey region, which represented 120 branches. Under his leadership, the region grew as a result of cross-selling initiatives and brand expansion. Prior to joining Yardville, Tylus held progressively-responsible leadership positions in the financial services, insurance, and healthcare industries. Early in his career, Mr. Tylus was a management consultant with Touche Ross (now Deloitte Consulting) where he became a Partner. He received his bachelor's degree from Gettysburg College in Gettysburg, Pa., where he serves as a Trustee and earned an MBA in finance from La Salle College in Philadelphia, Pa. He is a past member of the Franklin & Marshall College Leadership Council, the Chair of The Hun School of Princeton Board of Trustees and a leader for various community organizations.\n\nRobert Tabas, chairman of the board of Royal, stated, \"Kevin Tylus' banking experience is the perfect fit for Royal as we complete our management succession. He brings a combination of community bank and large bank experience, and a history of repositioning and growing businesses in challenging industries while building cohesive management teams and organizations. He added significant shareholder value for Yardville's stockholders by helping to lead the bank's transformation from a family-owned community bank to a larger, more sophisticated and successful organization. We believe that his appointment as president and chief executive officer is a positive next step for Royal, and will benefit our shareholders, customers, employees and the community we serve.\"\n\nKevin Tylus added, \"Royal Bank has a strong market presence in some of the most attractive markets in the greater Philadelphia area. Robert Tabas and the Royal team have carefully managed the bank through the downturn, and as a result, Royal has emerged with improved regulatory relationships, sound risk management practices, increased capital ratios, and an intense focus on meeting the banking needs of small-to-medium-sized businesses and consumers. This is an unprecedented opportunity for me to work with the entire Royal team to drive the next wave of growth for the bank.\"\n\nRobert Tabas added, \"This announcement represents the culmination of the process we launched earlier this year to transition Royal's management to an independent professional bank management team.

The 1075 sports a high-impact, heat and chemically resistant composite shell that will stand up to some of the harshest conditions known to man. The Pelican1075also features a sturdy, removable nylon shoulder strap so travelers can keep a firm hold on their gear.\n\nAs additional protection, the case features a shock-absorbing plush foam liner (with impact-protection cell cushions) and a strong, easy-snap, polymer latch to ensure that the computer stays secure and scratch free. The case's tongue-and-groove lid construction and polymer o-ring creates a watertight seal and its built-in, automatic pressure equalization valve keeps moisture out and makes it easier to open the case at any altitude.\n\nThe Pelican1075 HardBackwith computer case liner is also available with Pick N Pluck™ foam. ThePelicani1075 HardBack (coming soon) featuring a foam insert to protect, secure and display the iPad™ and iPad2 and accessories will also be available.

The groovy brass-based septet is fiercely led by its charismatic singer/sax player Carrie-Anne Murphy, who seemingly can sing but would much rather scream and roar her discontent, telling tales of alienation, misogyny and other delights to the sounds of punk-infused jazz and instrumental freakouts.

{"text": "Subscribe here to receive free recipes!\n\nGrandma Ruth's Homemade Lasagna\n\nSo many of you have been wondering where my lasagna recipe has been!? I know…I know…I advertise that I come from a long line of Italian women and I wait a year to give you our Lasagna recipe. I am not very nice, am I? Haha! Well here it is my friends….the recipes you have been waiting for! I pray you will enjoy this as many times I have with family and friends….I always double this recipe then purchase 1/2 lasagna throw-away pans to give away. It is also an excellent dish to freeze before baking.\n\nThis was one of my favorite days making lasagna because I had the awesome opportunity to have a mini cooking class with my neighbor's girls. This isn't just any neighbor either…this neighbor is the one who knocked on my door years ago and asked me to be a part of her bible study, which started my Christian walk. She is a very special person ….a \"God send\" if you will. This week, additional photos of our time together will be shared on \"The Better Mom\" website. Please take a moment and visit me over there this Thursday, Sept 15th!\n\nGrandma Ruth's Spaghetti Sauce-I made this around 8am. It takes very little time to prepare, but I like to have it simmer on low all day on the stove. The flavors mix so much better that way. Plus, I wouldn't be Italian if I didn't make sauce early in the morning, now would I? I have to \"represent\". The smell of this sauce reminds me of my Grandma's house.\n\nBrown a mixture of Italian sausage and lean ground beef. After it is cooked, drain it and set aside.\n\nRicotta cheese mixed with an egg. This makes the cheese \"fluffy\" (a Grandma term-cousins who are reading-did I get a laugh?)\n\nFreshly shredded Mozzarella cheese. I use block Kraft cheese and shred it. You may use \"real\" mozzarella or even slices if you wish. I suppose you can use bagged, but most of you know my fetish by now 😉\n\nI LOVE no boil lasagna noodles! The sauce in the lasagna combined with the heat of the oven cook these noodles perfectly. Do no fret..they work. I promise! I also prefer flat noodles to the wavy kind. Please use whatever noodle you prefer.\n\nA 9×13 lasagna pan. Lasagna pans are deeper than a regular 9×13- you can still use a 9×13 if it is all you have, your lasagna just won't have as many layers…but it still works! No fretting allowed.\n\nThese girls were working hard. More hands allowed me to take photos of the lasagna making in action! Sauce, noodles, ricotta cheese, mozzarella cheese, parm cheese, meats, sauce and repeat. One of the girls is garnishing with cheese, garlic powder and some parsley in this photo. The other is making a lasagna to take home for her family.\n\nBake at 350 and cover for 30 mins. Uncover and bake for 15 more mins until bubbly and slightly browned. Beautiful, isn't it?\n\nThank you girls! I had such a fun day making Lasagna with you! You did an AWESOME job!\n\nThis Recipe is excellent. I tried it the 1st time for my family and it came out dry, that's because I only used 1 jar of sauce. My kids made it known that it was dry too…LOL, REPEATEDLY! 2nd time i tried this recipe, I added 2 jars of spaghetti sauce to go with the meat and sausage and let it simmer for 4 hrs….The flavor is out of this world. Followed the Recipe to a T! Now my family can't get enough of it.\n\nI quadrupled tis recipe, usin my Mother-in-law's sauce from Italy. I also used equal parts of sausae & ground beef. In exchane for the mozerella, I used muenster. This was made 24 hours in advance of the groom's dinner it was prepared for, & turned out PERFECT. I have never had so many compliments on any meal I have ever prepared! I had never used the no-boil noodles, & will never go back to the other ones again!\nThank you for makin my dear cousin's special evening a success.\nSincerely, Linda Lindstrom\n\nI just made this dish for my husbands birthday dinner. He loves lasagna. I only got two layers down though, I hope it comes out okay. Something tells me that I put two much in between layers. We'll see\n\nI am going to the store and make it now. It is so great to have a real Italian give a recipe. Lots of Italians keep it as a secret recipe. MY parents and grandparents are gone and I haven't made it in years. I am so thankful for you. Thanks again.\nMichele\n\nI will be trying this recipe tomorrow. The sauce is actually the same I've been making for years except the green pepper, which I must try! My question is regarding the lasagna. Do you have to add the meat? My husband is obsessed with his grandmother's lasagna, but she only makes it once every few years and there is no meat in it. Wondering how it would affect not adding it?\n\nThanks so much for the recipe! I recently moved from tx to ar and have had an abundance of blessings since getting here. I have had one family in particular who has helped our family so much and we now attend their church regularly. I was wondering how i could show them our gratitude and appreciation. This recipe seems to be what i was looking for! This and hot artichoke and spinach dip and a thank you card! Thanks so much!\n\n[…] Homemade Lasagna This is an excellent choice to make ahead of time ( the night before) so that you don't have to clean up the kitchen on Valentine's day! Add a little extra sauce and wait to bake until you are ready!

Thank you.\n\nShop policies\n\nLast updated onMay 18, 2016\n\nThanks for visiting CherryChipCafe. We specialize in vinyl wall decals and wood signs, but can personalize just about anything. Don't see exactly what you want, email or convo us - we LOVE custom orders!\n\nAccepted payment methods\n\nAccepts Etsy gift cards\n\nPayment\n\nWe accept PayPal & all major credit cards: Visa, MasterCard, Discover, and American Express. Please allow 1-2 weeks of creation time before shipping for wood signs and custom orders, including all vinyl purchases.\n\nShipping\n\nWe ship via USPS Mail. Shipping time is usually 1-2 weeks. Shipping is always done with delivery confirmation. Insurance, if requested is an additional cost.\n\nSHIPPING ADDRESS:\nPurchases will be mailed to the address provided from PayPal. If you would like to have an item shipped to a different address please convo the address to me at the time of your purchase.\n\nRUSH ORDERS:\nWe're happy to offer rush orders. There will be an additional charge for a rush order. If you would like an order rushed, please let us know BEFORE you purchase an item. We need to notify the little elves when their overtime hours are coming!\n\nRefunds and Exchanges\n\nGenerally we do not offer refunds. However, if your item is damaged during shipment we'd happily replace it AFTER the original is returned to us.\n\nIf we do decide to refund an item, the shipping is not refunded. We will process the refund as soon as the item is returned back to us.\n\nIn regards to vinyl decals, often times we can replace a damaged letter or small \"shape\". If this is the case we're happy to cut a new one, all you'd need to pay for is the shipping. Or, if you prefer, we can cut the entire decal again at a reduced price to replace the original. A high quality picture of the damaged decal would need to be emailed to us in order to take advantage of the aforementioned replacement policy.\n\nAdditional policies and FAQs\n\nWHEN ARE ORDERS SHIPPED?\nPlease allow 1-2 weeks of creation time before shipping for custom orders, including all vinyl purchases. We ship through USPS which usually takes 2-5 business days (business days are Monday-Friday and do not include weekends or holidays).\n\nHOW ARE ORDERS SHIPPED?\nThe estimated delivery time is 2-5 business days via USPS Mail, however the Post Office does not guarantee that shipping timeframe. Tracking numbers are issued when shipped.\n\nCAN YOU RUSH ORDERS?\nIf you need your order sooner than the possible 5 (papercrafts) to 7 (custom orders and all vinyl decals) business days that creation and shipping could require we'd be happy to accommodate, but at an additional charge. Please keep in mind that at times rush orders may be impossible due to current work loads.\n\nWHAT IF I DAMAGE A VINYL ITEM DURING INSTALLATION?\nIn the unlikely event your decal is damaged during installation, we're happy to replace a letter or small \"shape\" for just the cost of shipping. Or, if you prefer, we can cut the entire decal again at a reduced price to replace the original. We are unable to assume responsibility for installation errors and, as such, a refund or replacement will not be issued.\n\nHOW DO I INSTALL MY VINYL DECAL?\nA simple instruction sheet will accompany each decal order. Should you need any further help, feel free to email or convo us.\n\nHOW DO I REMOVE MY VINYL DECAL?\nWhen you are ready to remove your decal, you can simply peel the vinyl away from the surface it is adhered to. You may use a blow dryer on the lowest setting to soften the vinyl for easier removal. Once removed, decals may be put up in a different location, but are unlikely to hold together or retain their adhesive backing.\n\nWHAT SHOULD I BE AWARE OF BEFORE INSTALLING MY DECAL?\n1. The life of vinyl decals installed on an indoor surface out of direct sunlight is 5-10 years (this timeframe can vary based on humidity, temperature, etc.)\n2. Vinyl decals installed in direct sunlight may fade and/or shrink.\n3. Once removed a vinyl decal that was in direct sunlight may leave a \"shaded\" silhouette in its place (i.e. sunlight will bleach the paint on the wall, therefore the paint where the decal was located may have remained slightly darker).\n4. Vinyl decals do not adhere to textured or dusty/dirty walls well.\n5. Walls recently painted should be allowed to dry for 2-3 weeks in order to prevent damage to the paint.\n6. Especially with larger decals it will be easier to have 2-3 people help during installation to prevent damage to the decal and to ensure that the decal is positioned correctly.", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "f6a4e38d-5794-4bc5-b7db-00d95932a4bd", "url": "https://www.etsy.com/shop/CherryChipCafe?ref=usr_faveitems&atr_uid=15844865"}

{"text": "Cheeky Wipes Kit\n\nCheeky Wipes- Washable Wipes Kit\n\nCheeky Wipes are an innovative solution to washable wipes that is taking the world of baby wipes by storm! This complete kit provides everything you need to make using washable wipes easy and convenient- and will save you a packet too!\n\nSave Money\n\nIf you buy a packet of disposable wipes every week for 2 years, that is a spend of a whopping £258.96! With absolutely nothing to show for it!\n\nCheeky Wipes can save you at least £221, and they are much better for the environment and your babies skin too!\n\nBetter for Babies Skin\n\nRegular baby wipes are rife with chemicals and fragrances, many of which are absorbed into your babies skin. It is scary to know that most commercial wipes can actually strip paint!!\n\nEasy to Use\n\nCheeky wipes are perfect to use whether you use washable nappies or not. The kit comes complete with a mesh bag which lines the mucky wipes tub- when its full just pop in in the machine with your next laundry load- No need to dry, just pop them back in the clean wipes tub, ready to be used again!\n\nCheeky Wipes are also convenient for out and about use- simply pop some clean wipes into the fresh wipes bag, then when each one is used, it can be popped into the mucky wipes bag- which again is lined with a mesh bag ready to go into the machine when you return! Fab!\n\nNew V3 Kits!\n\nVersion 3 features Flat, stackable lids and air-tight seals to keep your wipes fresher for longer!\n\nNew Single-Clip lids, means easy one-handed opening and closing, but makes it more robust and toddler-proof than version 2!\n\nFill water levels on both boxes\n\nInternal hooks on the mucky box to keep your mesh bag open and drip free\n\nI started using these prior to getting into cloth nappies. I found them following an internet search after my newborn started with nappy rash. They smell divine, feel glorious, are wonderful in every way. Why oh why would anyone use disposable baby wipes? Expensive, ineffectual, flimsy, leaving a horrid tacky residue on your hands..... Need I continue? Buy these, they are amazing!\n\nRating:\n\nWipes are great\n\nSunday, 20 April 2014 | Charlotte\n\nLove the wipes - I have white terry wipes for bottom and rainbow microfiber for face. Both great products. Oil smells good but bottle got slippery and I dropped it - expensive mistake - be careful! Clean box is bigger than I expected but well made and very useful.\n\nRating:\n\nI love them but the coloured Terry's run in the wash.\n\nThursday, 14 March 2013 | Geraldine\n\nI really really love my cheeky wipes they are so easy to use and my boys skin has never looked better, however be warned the aqua and pink terry wipes do run in the wash so make sure you don't wash them with your nappies! The oils are lovely.\n\nRating:\n\nWe love these!\n\nMonday, 4 March 2013 | Roselle\n\nVery easy to use and cleans bottoms much faster than cotton wool and water.\n\nRating:\n\nGreat kit\n\nFriday, 1 February 2013 | Jane\n\nThis kit is excellent and the essential oils make the bathroom smell lovely. The mucky tub is not essential if you are using cloth nappies as you can just throw the wipe in the nappy bucket, however, I do use it as it pre soaks the wipes before putting in the wash. I really love the out and about bags, the whole kit is great and the wipes are so much better than cotton wool or the disposable wipes which really are rubbish.\n\nRating:\n\nReally good idea\n\nWednesday, 16 January 2013 | Claire\n\nJust recieved my Cheeky Wipes Kit and am looking forward to using them when the baby arrives. Very well thought out with everything you need for mucky and clean wipes, at home and out and about. The instructions are really clear too. I'll definately be using these even if we don't end up using real nappies (hopefully we'll find some that suit us though) as the essential oils included smell so much nicer and are so much less paint stripper-ish than disposables. They're obviously so much better for the environment too.\n\nRating:\n\nAmazing product\n\nWednesday, 9 January 2013 | Natasha\n\nHaving received my wipes today i am already surprised at how i have survived before now without them! They are lovely on my 14 week old baby and my toddler loves the smell...so do i for that matter! Would definitely recommend.\n\nRating:\n\nAn amazing kit!\n\nSaturday, 22 December 2012 | Esther\n\nHugely recommend this kit! Makes it so easy to set up and use. Totally makes sense if you're already using cloth nappies etc as you only need one bin, your laundry bin. But I would say go for it even if you're not using reusables, it's great for babies bottoms as well as the environment, money and easier to clean.\n\nRating:\n\nA shame\n\nThursday, 29 November 2012 | A.\n\nI bought the kit several months ago and had just gotten into the habit of using it (1 month) when the lid hinges on one of the boxes snapped after I dropped it. I still have the hinge pins so all I need is a replacement lid, but until I do the kit is completely unusable. I queried getting a replacement lid and was told the query had gone to the manufacturer, but as yet no replacement lid has been forthcoming. In the meantime I have been spending a lot on the biodegradable disposable wipes. Such a shame replacement parts for the kit elements are not readily available, it would have saved me a lot of money. Be warned the lids only just open to an angle of 90degrees and so only just stay open which can be a bit awkward, an of course be careful not to drop it with the lid open!\n\nRating:\n\nbest buy!\n\nThursday, 1 November 2012 | Jamie\n\none of my fave baby buys, we now have 2 clean boxes one fort the kitchen and one for the changing table. really easy to use and soooo much better than wipes, they get poo off so well whereas wipes smear it all over. love them", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "b7388c23-8cbb-42e2-aa19-2d3aa0f2feb7", "url": "http://www.fill-your-pants.com/cloth-baby-wipes/cheeky-wipes.html"}

Because the template message is in html mode, it also creates the link tag on the upload field. But if you set all text in plain Text only, even the link of the upload field will be read as plain text (the complete URL link address)\n\nPlease try this on your form.

Seven days on our second Alaska cruise with many people who have cruised many times before, so this was perfect as we were treated as intelligent humans... not needing to be \"organized\" on the deck in order to know to look at the glacier off starboard. The dining is excellent. One can charge into the buffet at any hour or relax in the restaurant whenever it suits you with friendly service.

{"text": "Featured\n\nLatest\n\nStress, among other things, can most certainly do a lot of damage to your skin. In fact, one of the most evident manifestations of stress and lack of rest can easily be seen on the face.\n\nGiven my constant traveling in and out of the country, plus the demands of my work and lifestyle, stress and lack of ample rest can never be avoided. And since having my photo taken every so often is part of the line of work that I'm in, I cannot allow myself to look tired and haggard. So, I try to find other ways to counter the negative effects of this kind of lifestyle.\n\nSome people in the same industry (showbusiness/entertainment) look to moisturizers, lotions, and yes… even surgery. I, on the other hand, have found a means to counter these effects and improve my well-being in a much simpler and incredibly easier way.\n\nEverytime Christmas comes around, it's always great to find new ways to share and celebrate the festive season with friends and family.\n\nThe Philippines is known to celebrate Christmas the longest compared to other countries in the world. And during this long period, we Filipinos love to get together, eat out, and have a merry time with people we love.\n\nMy family similarly loves to find time to be together and bond over good food and fun activities especially during the Yuletide season. So, finding new attractions and great places to dine is always something we take seriously.\n\nA couple of days ago, one of our many simple family getaways to celebrate Christmas time was by heading over to SM by the BAY to check out the various cool establishments and attractions.\n\nWe decided to visit SM by the BAY because, for one, the 1.5 Km entertainment complex boasts of having one of the best views of the Manila Bay sunset. Apart from that, the place also offers a vast range of dining and buffet options and a unique park experience that are perfect for friends and family.\n\nWith the complex operating from 6AM-2AM and restaurants that are open from 11AM-1AM, SM by the BAY offers non-stop fun all year round. The place is open every day – especially during Christmas and New Year.\n\nI particularly loved how one can easily feel the holiday spirit at SM by the BAY because the place is adorned with Christmas decorations, a 75ft Christmas Tree and festive lights installed along the entire stretch of the complex. In addition, music and fireworks can be enjoyed on Fridays and Saturdays at 7PM. Whee!\n\nAlso, SM by the BAY offers a wide variety of mouth-watering food as well as fun and exhilarating amusement rides like the iconic MOA Eye.\n\nHere in the Philippines, festivals are times of great joy and celebration wherein our diverse culture and traditions are best showcased.\n\nSome of these festivals celebrate historical occurrences while majority highlight the strong Catholic influence in our country as well as religious commemorations.\n\nWhile all these celebrations are fine and well, there are a few whose aim is to bring more attention and awareness to certain causes and advocacies. One such occasion is the \"Pawikan Festival\" in the town of Morong, located in the province of Bataan.\n\nI have to say Philippines AirAsia has one of the best (if not THE BEST) in-flight meals anywhere around. I say this with no bias or partiality whatsoever. Anyone who has tried them would most certainly agree.\n\nPhilippines AirAsia's new in-flight meals are well portioned, flavorful, and very satisfying. Apart from that, they have a good selection of meals to choose from. In fact, they're one of the things I truly look forward to whenever I have a flight.\n\nAnd Philippines AirAsia knows, just like any master of his/her respective game, that no matter how good you are, there is always room to get better.\n\nTrue enough… in their desire to become better in order to please every customer that walks into their aircraft, the world's best low-cost airline has upgraded and come up with a new selection of in-flight meals called, \"Santan\". And boy, was I excited the moment I first caught wind of it.\n\nIt is worth noting that replacing \"AirAsia Café\" to \"Santan\" is part of Philippines AirAsia's latest offering to enhance customer experience while flying.\n\nFor those who aren't aware, Santan is an essential ingredient in Malay cooking which refers to the liquid obtained from pressing shredded coconut meat that is used in almost all ASEAN dishes. Philippines AirAsia allows passengers to enjoy several fares that pay homage to the incredibly rich ASEAN flavours. Some of these dishes are Nasi Lemak, Chicken Rice, Beef Caldereta and Adobo which are available on certain flights. In addition, our Muslim friends will be glad to know that Philippines AirAsia hotmeals and sandwiches are Halal Certified.\n\nI was able to try a good number of these Santan selections during a tasting session of Philippines AirAsia's new in-flight meals while traveling to Hong Kong very recently. It goes without saying that I was truly impressed with their newest offerings.\n\nIndeed, Christmas is just around the corner. Unfortunately, as much as we love the joyful and giving spirit it brings to all of us, much of it is lost the moment we step into the road and take on the ridiculously terrible traffic all over Metro Manila.\n\nThe Yultide season makes traveling all the more difficult due to the relentless Christmas rush of holiday shoppers and folks who are most probably moving from one party to another.\n\nIn as much as this time of the year is all about \"giving\", it is extremely challenging to send over some Christmas joy to friends and family by way of gifts and goodies. Just imagine the eternity it takes for one person taking on Metro Manila's congested roads in order to drop off a couple of presents. Oh, precious time! And woe to those spending for expensive petrol.\n\nThat's why my wife and I thought of taking advantage of Grabtaxi's nifty new service called, GrabExpress!\n\nIn a nutshell, GrabExpress is pretty much like a personal delivery service. Your very own courier, if you will. And since GrabExpress uses motorcycles as their mode of transport, weaving through traffic and avoiding road congestion is effortless.\n\nGadget Reviews\n\nHealth & Fitness\n\nFood\n\nI love eating spicy food and curry is no exception. Every now and then, I'd ask my wife to whip something up in the kitchen that has a touch of curry in it like Chicken or Beef Curry, perhaps.

Benito's villa photos DO NOT do his place justice. Best views on the island!!!! The villa is amazing, spacious, comfortable, modern. All rooms have satellite TV, brand new strong air con units that cool the place very fast, the villa has everything one needs and more. The jacuzzi is amazing with music features and many configuration options. The place is very safe with two remote controlled garage doors and a private road; The family loved it! The boys were in love with the pool all day, best pool ever, Benito has staff cleaning the pool every morning with an automated robot machine. I cannot say enough good things about Benito's place. We will be going again next year with more friends and hope we can rent villa Gaia :) Benito hosted us with his good friends one night and had awesome cocktails in his villa mansion. I am in the process now of convincing other friends with their families to join me next year and rent the villa for a week; best holidays ever. And Benito is one of the best hosts I have come across, from now a friend too. Five minutes drive down the road one can find an authentic bakery for morning fresh chocolate croissants and other treats; the baker had an order for us every day. And nearby lots of other shops and restaurants, very handy. Best villa on the island best views with he best host. What else can someone ask for :) See you again next year\n\nYiannis2016-06-26T00:00:00Z\n\nSuper great place & awesome host! Nothing to complain!\n\nHin Shing2016-06-12T00:00:00Z\n\nI stayed at Villa Luce in August with my husband and two children and Benito was the perfect host. The villa is beautiful, spacious and in excellent condition. The pool and outside space is fantastic and was cleaned and looked after every day during our stay. On arrival we were provided with pool towels as well as bath towels and new room slippers. The villa was well furnished and everything was of great quality, from the crisp white bedding down to glasses, plates, cutlery etc. Each bedroom has a stunning bathroom and excellent view from the balconies. I couldn't recommend Villa Luce more highly.\n\nLouise2016-09-02T00:00:00Z\n\nFrom the minute we arrived at Villa Luce, our host Benito made us feel so welcome. He greeted us with a chilled bottle of bubbles whilst we relaxed by the pool. The villa has amazing views over Gouvia, which pictures do not do justice and is in a very quiet location so you are not disturbed by anyone. The villa is spacious and modern with air-con in every room. The pool is a great size and is in the sun until almost 7pm! The outside areas are cleaned and maintained daily. Benito made sure we had everything we needed and was more than happy to help with local knowledge and restaurant recommendations. If you are planning to visit Villa Luce, you should hire a car as even the closest shops are around 2km away and the villa is located on the top of a hill! We would definitely consider returning to Villa Luce or another of Benito's properties.\n\nLauren2016-08-20T00:00:00Z\n\nBenito met us at 1 am after a late flight and was extremely welcoming. Everything about villa Luce was amazing, unbelievable views!\n\nRiff2016-07-26T00:00:00Z\n\nFrom the very beginning Benito went out of his way to accommodate us in any way he could which made made things a lot easier for us. The photos of this villa do not do it justice ..the rooms are all spacious and all the bedrooms are ensuite with their own balconies ...the pool area is large and the views are out of this world( it is really worth getting up early to watch the sunrise over the mountains ). Another plus is because the villa is situated up at a height there is a lovely breeze which is very much welcomed on hot days . Although the villa has 2 neighbouring properties it is very private and quiet. A car is a must. We stayed at the villa mid May and the whole surrounding area was covered in wild flowers which was really beautiful . I would def recommend staying here .\n\nlow cost apartment in Gouvia, Corfu, too close to the nature. located in a natural scenery with beautifull view near to a lake .\nThe Villa has 3 bedrooms with double beds and 2 bedrooms with 2 separate beds , also the is 2 living rooms , 2 cusines ,4 bathroums\nFor the person who \"loves\" the outdoors\nA whole house for you and your family or friends in the nature\njust relaxing in quiet surroundings.\nWe will welcome you with a basket with traditional products of our island\nIf you want, we can provide food for you, ask for prices.\n\nAre you looking for a very special destination for short break are you a nature and culture lover?\nThen let yourself be pampered to your heart's content.\n\"Enjoy this spacious and bright house 3 floors near Gouvia Village ,\nincluding a sunny garden and swimming pool near to little lake : a fantastic holiday spot!\nCleaning of the apartment and change of towels every 4 days.\n\nThe Gouvia village is 1 km away and there you can find many shops, bars, restaurants and mini markets.\none Super market you find 900 km distant from the villa\nThe wonderful sandy Gouvia Beach with the shallow water is only 1500km\nThe hospital is at a distance 1.5km\nThe historical town of Corfu and the beaches on the west or east coast are within few minutes drive 9km", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "a966001a-14ef-40cc-887c-2eeeabd1d3c7", "url": "https://th.airbnb.com/s/Kira-Chrisikou--%E0%B8%81%E0%B8%A3%E0%B8%B5%E0%B8%8B?type=house"}

This holiday season was ridiculously short, don't you think? We finally got our stockings up tonite. I love them so much, the boy and I made them a couple years ago. I don't have any pictures of them, which seems silly, but I will try to take one and post it soon. This is my lovely wreath I got last year at Flutter. The woman that owns that store seriously has the best taste. This photo is totally grainy and dark which somehow captures the wreath wonderfully. I also got most of my holiday cards out. I made them and I want to share that project too. So much good stuff to get to and only 6 days left to do it! Also, if you have a moment, Susan from West Coast Crafty was kind enough to include me in her round up of Crafty Wonderland on Craftstylish. She has a sweet baby named Pearl who now my wiener dog onesie in a variety of colors and sizes.

The highly anticipated release of MAC's Selena collection will debut Sept. 30 in Corpus Christi, with a free event at the American Bank Convention Center.\n\nFor Selena's fans, MAC's newest line runs thicker than just the eyeliner they're selling. This 14-product collection will allow fans to connect with the Queen of Tejano on new a level — a level that is so personal, MAC wanted the late singer's hometown to get the first look. An experience that, no matter the price of the makeup, will be remembered as priceless.\n\nThe collection, which will be available online and in all MAC stores Oct. 6 through Nov. 17, comprises an eyeliner, mascara, gloss, three shades of lipstick, including Selena's iconic red color, a powder-blush duo, a brush and five eye shadows, with each piece named after one of Selena's songs.\n\nAs reported earlier this week by the Express News, the idea for this line came from a petition on Change.org last year, asking MAC to design a line around the singer's famous look. The petition gained nearly 38,000 signatures and clearly demonstrated a need for the line.\n\nFor many, Selena will always be a style icon. Her signature red lips and dark eyeliner is and will always be more than a trend, and through this collection and her fans, Selena's timeless beauty lives on.", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "bca979c9-021a-4ebe-819c-35030ca3777c", "url": "https://www.sacurrent.com/ArtSlut/archives/2016/09/29/macs-selena-collection-is-finally-here"}

After a few washes, the lint balls stop falling off, but that isn't the case with this blanket. I've attempted to (gradually) wash it about 4 times, hoping the frayed material would fall off, but it just gets worse with each wash. Little balls of lint covering the entire blanket, they don't come off either, not by fabric softener, OR by vacuuming. They're practically glued on, and I'm not going to spend 5 hours picking them off with tweezers. It's a cute blanket, soft and colorful, but a complete waste of money, since washing it destroys it. Also, if you have a dog that sheds? Good luck, this blanket is a fur MAGNET, and it's such a pain to vacuum the hair off. Took 30 minutes, every day to get it cleared off. Don't waste your money on this.\n\nDate published: 2015-04-17\n\nRated 3 out of 5 by Catherine8211 from Hang dry this blanket ONLY!Blanket is cute just dont put it in the dryer\n\nDate published: 2015-11-16\n\nRated 5 out of 5 by sewgreat1 from so softthis blanket works great as a bedspread! it is so very soft and HUGE>> well worth the $$ the kids LOve it\n\nDate published: 2017-03-10\n\nRated 5 out of 5 by JessimukaSinceThe3rdGrade from Mario Kart BlanketMy son loves this blanket.

I will say that all hallways appeared to have non-functioning air conditioning, but lobby, breakfast area and rooms had well-functioning A/C.

I spent hours on this and now I need to rebuild many pages as I lost vital widgets, but no certainty that there is a final answer as the problem has not been duplicated and your plugin is not now working. Could it be the service provider problem?\n\n(this was written prior to shutting off all plugins) I am at wits end, my site was working fine then I installed the Ultimate Facebook plugin, carefully set up according to (the helpful) video. It (worked) to post from buddypress activity feed to Facebook fan page fine... but all of my pages for vitals like donations, contact us, and the rest of the menu no longer work...\"page not found\" and all the info is still there in the WordPress editor, but cant even get 'view page' to work at that level. (also tried updating the page and changing around options there)\n\nI tried reviewing each tick of Fb Ultimate, so far I can find nothing that changes this problem. All I can guess is that some setting, or method within the plugin is shutting down the pages and making them unable to be found.... Please what could I be missing, or what might be done to fix this? I am new to your system but the access is set up, I considered shutting down the plugin, but not certain if I would lose all the hard earned API info and settings. (that could be helpful to know for future considerations others may have)\nSecondarily the Facebook sign up for a new member function seems to lock up too. Is there a good way to test it? ( since the info for my FB pages may make it appear that I am not a new member because of a Facebook fan page, personal page, & admin automatic selection; is there a sure way around this for testing the new member sign up process?)\n\nThe site is for a nonprofit,  Home page was working fine; activity feed worked too and goes to FB fine at one point/// now not working with no change in the settings, only in and out with the plugins.\n\nComments 5\n\nWould you please clarify, once you deactivated the other plugins the pages came back to normal? The pages are showing up for me now, I also tested the BuddyPress activity page and it is working there as well.\n\nPlease clarify what is the issue you are having now, you can't post new updates on the activity Feed? Or the new posts re not auto-posting to Facebook?\n\nThanks for you quick response. I tried deactivating all plugins. At some point late in the process I cleared the cashe and restarted the computer, I am not sure but that may have helped to get the tabs/pages working, but at the same time nearly every plugin was off. Now I have more than normal plugins on, and the pages do not show up as \"not found\"...at least now. No lost pages today.\n\nBUT at the website, buddypress activity feed will no longer post to FB, which I tried several ways, ticked FB feed option, refreshing constantly, even w/o image- and no post shows in FB. I see your test, but now nothing works, though going at it from all angels I can think of.\nPs As per your request I checked box for- use minimal permission, reset auth tokens, and saved.\nFeed to FB tried on many browsers, 3 different computers and they don't work. I can't see how you got it to go with a test, but the consistency of the site's response seems to change with same orders giving different results. The activity posts directly on the website seem to work fine but again the autopost to FB is not working. (yet had worked fine for me 30 hours ago until I noticed the menu tabs were dead, ie. so I know how it should work)\nAny help of course would be greatly appreciated.\nVictor \nodd additional item, the Fan page itself has double posted a few times, posts made once directly on the FB page.\n\nI have discovered the error log and a report that obviously shows the FB Ultimate having problems. I had reset the token so I think that is resolved (thanks Nastia), but the later error seems to indicate that the API is not playing well. There is a link to the error but when going there to the Facebook developers site, there is no obvious help as it must be many layers deep into one of the various articles. I had very carefully installed the API as per the wpmudev video, but at one point it mentioned some choice types did not matter, perhaps that was not accurate to today's API settings, but I can not be sure as there seems to be no clear definition to the details. Please direct me to how I may solve this as posts from my tests from the Buddypress activity feed are (not) able to auto post to the given Facebook page.\nThanks very much,\nVictor\nattached should be the error log and also a collection of all the settings. (support- I have backups please feel free to do anything you wish)\n[image pos=\"0\"]\n\nBUT at the website, buddypress activity feed will no longer post to FB, which I tried several ways, ticked FB feed option, refreshing constantly, even w/o image- and no post shows in FB.\n\nI tested the plugin on my installation and the activity posts were published successfully.\n\nI've checked the error log and the following message means that the facebook Application wasn't found: Unsupported get request. Object with ID '***' does not exist, cannot be loaded due to missing permissions, or does not support this operation.\n\nWhich means that the API Key and the Secret Key are not correct or the Facebook Application is missing.\n\nSo the first step here is to recheck your APP credentials, make sure that there are no blank spaces.\n\nNext please make sure that the Facebook Application is been approved from facebook and it is live. On the  select your app and navigate to APP Review and make the App public\n\nAlthough something telling me that the issue with the APP user ID, have you yourself authorized the app or someone else did it for you?\n\nPlease note, in order to a post to be posted on Facebook, a person that shares a post need to be authorized.

{"text": "Subscription Nation: May Ipsy Glam Bag 2017\n\nOn to month two and I am not disappointed. For those of you who haven't heard of it, Ipsyis a monthly subscription bag that sends you five beauty products based on a quiz that goes over your preferences. It's only $10 and the products always covers that cost and more.\n\nThe theme this month was Summer Friday. Bright sun, cool waters, and ice cream to take a bit of the heat away… This was captured perfectly in the cute bag for May – a plastic, see through case covered in ice cream cones and bars. It definitely has that summer vibe to it and is beach protected. No water or sand to sneak in and destroy any of your beauty products!\n\nMy product selections this month were fantastic – I loved almost all of them!\n\nThis was my least favorite in the bag, but only because I wasn't a fan of the gel effect. It was a bit too gooey for me. Okay – I was also a little bummed because the polish I got last month was in the same color family. However, I love this color so it wasn't a big deal. It looks really cute on, but I only got a few nails before I decided it wasn't for me. It has a retail value of $18.\n\nYes, please. I am all about the bold and bright lip color, especially in these gorgeous reds. It's a brilliant power color. The mini matte lip crayon goes on really smoothly and looks great on. Super happy about this product and can't wait to wear it on my vacay to Cali! This lip crayon has a retail value of about $10.60.\n\nLong wearing and long glowing, this highlighter is just gorgeous! It's a really subtle shade on my skin but definitely gives my face a brighter appearance when on. It's supposed to last for 8 hours and I would say it meets that! This isn't a full-size, but it should last me for a while. Retail value is about $9.\n\nIt's no secret that my brush collection needs a bit of work outside of eyeshadow brushes. That's why I was ecstatic to find out a foundation brush was in this month's bag. It's super soft and works wonderfully! Plus, it's like 100% vegan and cruelty-free and you can't beat that. Retail value of $23.\n\nI've saved the best for last. I am obsessed. This stamp and pen duo is exactly what I needed in life. I'm a huge fan of liquid eyeliner and this one glides on so smoothly. It's easy to correct unstraight lines on a cat eye. But the stamp is by far my favorite part. I've been wanting one since New Year's when my friend Chelsie brought one over for us to use for our celebrations. And like I mentioned in my post on Monday, I wore the stamp every night of Austin Fashion Week and got so many compliments on it. I might have even sold a few. My only question: Starlooks, where's my commission at? Retail value of $19.\n\nAs you can see, it was definitely a good month.

{"text": "The travels (and tribulations) of NB SEYELLA on the canals and rivers of England and Wales\n\nSunday, May 17, 2009\n\nEnding a stay at Thrupp\n\nI've not posted since last Tuesday because, frankly, there's not been a lot going on! I had a run down into Oxford on Wednesday morning to check out the mooring situation for the weekend, and was not impressed. Just around the corner from us though was Thrupp, with its service point and good moorings. So we took the decision to stay here, on the 7 day section, till after the weekend. I checked up on public transport for Sunday morning to get me into Oxford for the race, but decided to go for the easier option and arranged for a taxi to pick me up at The Boat Inn, drop me off near the start, and bring me back afterwards.\n\nIt was about midday when we pulled pins and travelled the ½ mile or so down to the sanitary station.\n\nFrom Shipton to Thrupp Having filled the water tank and emptied the loos and rubbish, it was just a matter of getting under the lift bridge. Then finding a spot on the 7 day moorings.\n\nUnder the lift bridge at Thrupp We moored in front of NB Sunflower. I got chatting to Rob and Ann (on Sunflower) and it turns out that they're both runners, too. In fact Rob's club look after one of the finishing lanes at the London Marathon each year. So if I get a place, I'll be looking out for him at the end. That's if I get that far….\n\nWe had friends visit while we've been here. First Jan came over from Bicester on Thursday, and treated us to lunch at The Boat, then we had James and Gina from Abingdon yesterday for lunch and the afternoon. Very enjoyable both visits were too.\n\nSo on to today, and the reason we're here at the bottom of the Oxford Canal. I got collected as arranged by a very pleasant gentleman from Kidlington Taxis, and was dropped off 15 minutes from the University Parks in Oxford.\n\nThe finish line of the Oxford Town and Gown. It gets busier later…. The course winds around the town centre, quite congested in places and the rain and blustery wind didn't help, either. Still, the surface was good and the atmosphere kept the spirits up. My time was disappointing though. When I first started running seriously, back in 2002, I pushed it too hard on the training. Most new runners will be able to recognise the problems. Inappropriate shoes, inappropriate training plan, inappropriate warm up and cool down. The upshot of my ignorance was injuries to the muscles in both my shins. Up until now I've not had a recurrence of the problem, but 5 or 6 weeks ago it came back. I've tried to \"run through it\" which is the worst thing to do, and it has compromised my ability to train at an intensity that would have given me a good time today. So I was disappointed, but not surprised to be off the pace by 20 or so seconds per mile. I managed a couple of fast kilometres, but could not sustain the pace. Though maybe the half a dozen painkillers I took before the race didn't help…. Anyway, for the first time in 3 years I'm not able to say I've improved my PB, In fact today it slipped back by 1:45. Ah well. There's always Sheffield in September. I can take a month or so off now to let my shins heal properly.\n\nAt least I finished before these guys… Just along the cut from here are Bones and Maffi. I'd seen their boats on my excursions out with Meg, and had exchanged a few words with Bones when she came up for water. We were pleasantly surprised when we had a knock from them this evening, inviting us to join them for a drink in the pub. So we've had a very enjoyable couple of hours in The Boat, meeting others of the waterborn fraternity and chatting. Thanks, both. We'd just have been stuck in front of the TV, otherwise. Meg enjoyed herself too, half a bag of pork scratchings and a chance to say hello to Bones' pooch, Boots, and she's in heaven.\n\nThe weather seems set to remain the same, sunny periods and showers. We'll be heading down the last bit of the canal, through Oxford, and out onto the Thames tomorrow. Turning right, we'll be heading upstream, destination Lechlade at the head of the navigation. Everyone we've spoken to says it a fine trip, so we're looking forward to it.\n\nHi Both Aye, more frustrated than dispirited. Still, a month off should see it mended, then it's back on with the running shoes... Anyway, it wasn't all bad. I came in 563rd out of around 4000, 38th in my age catagory. So maybe I wasn't the only one having a bad day....

{"text": "Laundry Buttons\n\nMay 21, 2008\n\nI asked my Be Design partner, Christy, to create my header for me. Which may seem strange considering I can make my own, except for some reason, I couldn't do my own. It was too hard, so I quit and said \"Oh, Christy, my love, would you please create my header for me and when you do, just do it in a way that shows me how you think of me.\" and this is one of the images she chose. Which I love. I have to say that I was relieved, I thought she may come back with a header filled with cattle or dirty underwear. But this is what she found and I love it.\n\nA lot. (you should go to Christy's blog to check out her designs from our first week of business. THEY ARE ROCKIN'!)\n\nand speaking of the fabulous Be Design girls, we are now offering blog makeovers for WORDPRESS. HOORAY! However, our wait time is right on the line between four and five weeks. BOO! But we move quickly! HOORAY!\n\nI'm glad some of you enjoyed my live blogging from last night, I may do it for tonight's finale, as requested, but right now I have a headache and fear it would make a very boring post. Something like \"Paula's dress is weird and David won.\"\n\nBased on the comments, I think David Cook is going to win. Seems everyone thinks David A. has it in the bag and because of that, everyone seems to be voting for David C. I didn't vote at all. Because, well. I don't care. I really don't. I enjoyed this season, but there was nobody that I LOOOOVED. I tried voting for Chris Daughtry but his wife kept hanging up on me every time I called. She can be so rude to his girlfriend, I swear.\n\nOh, and I blogged over here today. It's pretty depressing, so click at your own risk, and if you click, make sure you comment because nothing sends me into a depression quicker than seeing hundreds of people visiting my other blog when I'm pouring out my heart and three people comment. Just keepin' it real.\n\nAnd finally, I believe I have eaten two boxes of Bug Bites since Sunday. And I can't even hide that fact from Brian because he's the one who keeps buying them at the store. Makes it pretty obvious.\n\nIn fact, he's at the store right now. Buying more Bug Bites. Interestingly enough, when I googled Bug Bites, the cookies did not come up, but rather pictures of bug bites. ew.\n\nMe and my headache have to go hide under the covers for awhile, I hope I'm back tonight for more live blogging. I can make no promises.\n\nMay 19, 2008\n\nI am so excited about this giveaway, mainly because I get to give something away to one of my readers and I happen to love and adore my readers, so it's EXTRA fun for me to have a giveaway.\n\nEspecially this giveaway.\n\nI am giving away a $50 gift certificate to Shabby Apple. If you haven't seen their product line, you must go check it out. Everything is so very trendy, yet simple. I love it all. So, when they approached me and I visited their site, I couldn't refuse. Just look at their stuff!\n\nI am already jealous of the person who wins this giveaway - between the bags and the bracelets and the dresses - I could spend the entire day on their website. Seriously, any business that says \"Rock Your Frock\" has my approval. LOVE IT.\n\nSo, here's how you win: On this post and THIS POST only, tell me something about you in the comments. You must tell me something about you, it could be that you've never traveled outside of your state or that you love grape jelly (which I think is gross, by the way) but you must tell me something. Saying \"enter me\" will only disqualify you. Sorry - I know the rules are tough, but I want to learn more about you and this is how I can!\n\nI look forward to learning more about you. Feel free to tell me as much as you want. I'm listening.\n\nThe comments will be closed Wednesday night at 7:00 P.M. CST and I will draw the winner from the entire lot of comments. I will announce the winner of this contest and the American Idol blog makeover contest on Thursday.\n\nGood luck.\n\n(yes, I know I've asked you to tell me something about you before, but it was so much fun, I wanted to do it again to learn more. Tell me something new. I tell you something new all of the time! It's your turn, baby.)I do hope you check out our beautiful and amazing website, we are both so excited to be doing something that we both love so much. This adventure, I know, is meant to BE. Since Christy and I decided to start Be Design I have been wonderfully distracted, excited and well, happy. It's been a very welcomed project in my life. A beautiful gift.\n\nSo, check it out. And feel free to tell your friends about it. We would be forever grateful. (feel free to use the code at the bottom of this post or just straight up steal that button over there! No really! Steal it! I won't tell!) Go there, come back and tell me what you think. You're my friends and your opinion matters to me. If you do tell your blog readers about it, come back and tell me, I want to see it!

{"text": "MyDermacy\n\nApp,web, UI/UX\n\nBackground\n\nBeauty done right\n\nWhen I joined MyDermacy (now BeYouPlus) back in 2016, it was a tiny team of dedicated employees who are trying to solve a problem that most of us face when trying to look for beauty solutions. That's when MyDermacy comes in. MyDermacy was a platform\nintended to be the best resource to connect to experts to share your concern to make an informed decision.\n\nRole\n\nPart-time Mentor & designer\n\nNitish Vaid\n\nCondition before me\n\nAlthough, we were working on an important problem and had a lot going for us. Our web app was a bit of a mess. It didn't do a great job of showcasing the true value of our amazing product. There were lot of design issues like :\n\nNo Design standards which make the overall experience very poor\n\nMissing UX fundamentals like no brand consistency, poor information architecture across the product\n\nHigh dropout and disengaged users\n\nThere were no apps for doctors & patients leaving out a big opportunity for us\n\nMy role\n\nAs sole UI/UX Designer, I was in charge of the overall user experience across all platforms (iOS, Android, web) and products (b2b and b2c) under the MyDermacy umbrella. My Day to day role involves in the end to end product design while collaborating\nwith PM, engineers & CEO to continuously improve the product experience. It was a fun & learning exercise for me because I got to work on multiple projects side by side rather than focusing on one core experience.\n\nWhy rebranding?\n\nAs a brand, we need to evolve with growing business opportunities.\n\nWith the current brand, we're just tapping Dermatologist segment, even when there are other beauty segments out there that we can easily target\n\nWe're providing limited experience for our users with just consulting when we can provide them a better, more meaningful & complete solution. With growing user base, we need to give a new head start to problem approach\n\nWe're also missing out other business opportunities like machine renting to doctors\n\nCurrent product worked well with past requirements, but it's becoming difficult for it to adapt to increased demand for complex new features & scaling existing features.\n\nDesign Limitations\n\nDesign resources were very limited in the face of tight deadlines. I was the sole designer for complete experience across platforms like web, Android & iOS which forces me to manage my time carefully & strictly. As a designer, I also need\nto provide myself enough time to think about upcoming problems & need to stay ahead of developers at the same time.\n\nUnderstanding the user problem\n\nIn order to successfully execute on a problem, I first need to understand the problem. Product design is a multidisciplinary craft that includes research, competitive analysis, user behavior analysis, and an understanding of technical constraints.\n\nThe goal of this initiative was to understand user behaviors, their needs, interests to leverage this information to build a great product.\n\nFrom our learnings from MyDermacy & by looking deep into data, I found out our initial target segment to do user interviews. While we were defining the future of BeYouPlus, I define some of the questions I'm going to ask from our\ntargeted group:\n\nWhat is the most important thing to you while selecting an expert for your concern?\n\nHow do you currently find experts? (Analyse current workflow)\n\nWhat could be better to find the best expert? (Find opportunities)\n\nAfter gaining insights, it's time to build the product using the learning from research.\n\nUser needs\n\nThrough extensive user research, we realized that people have different (and often very complicated) workflows, processes, and workarounds when it comes to selecting treatment & expert. We quickly realized there was a tremendous opportunity\nto offer a compelling product and that users were excited about the idea of a new product to meet their needs. Interviewing users gave us a lot of insight into user needs.\n\nWhich treatment to go for — easily see all treatments for specific concern\n\nHow many sessions — see how many sessions require for getting the best results\n\nWhere to go — decide which clinics/expert to go in a particular location\n\nApproach\n\nAs a designer, I'm driven by empathy & empowerment to build confidence. My objective for the product was to design an experience by empathizing with end user needs while balancing business priorities at the same time. My objective for developers\nwas to push their limit by standardizing guidelines to enable them to make certain design decisions independently & for management to take design-thinking in consideration while making business decisions & pushing them towards making user\ndecision forefront.\n\nDesign Principles\n\nIn order to communicate effectively as a designer across engineering, and to stakeholders we all need to speak the same language. While designing a new product, inevitably a lot of assumptions are made along the way. To help with this challenge\nand to support the assumptions, it is extremely valuable to establish a set of core design values(principles) that will allow to think systematically.\n\nThese design principles help us with:\n\nmaking sure the product is unified and works as expected supporting design decisions\n\nCommunicating your decisions to engineering and getting buy-in from stakeholders\n\nCreating a sense of trust with your users\n\nPut users first We deeply believe in the necessity to think about the needs of different type of users & how we can respond to them in product or feature in the best way possible. Whenever possible, use research to inform\nyour decision-making to find out how users think & work.\n\nKeep users in control & don't let them feel overwhelm This is what we strive for at all times. We at BeYouPlus build end to end product to help doctors & patients to help accomplish their goals. Even though the systems we design\nare complicated, they should feel effortless & in control.\n\nBuild a cohesive experience across all platforms BeYouPlus should feel like a cohesive experience to patients & doctors, no matter where they are in the product. Use consistent language, patterns, components across the product\ninterface to make it easier & intuitive for users to accomplish their goals.\n\nBe polished but don't be ornamental BeYou should be polished, looks good & feel like a world-class experience, but not for the sake of being pretty. Every aesthetics (color, component, pattern) decision we take - from how we design\nshould be purposeful.\n\nIterations: Wireframes, prototype & feedback\n\nWorking closely with my PM, we worked through multiple brainstorming sessions to gain a better understanding of a typical users experience. I began by identifying key issues in user flow to make it more user-friendly. Having this zoomed out, bird's\neye view gave me a lot more visibility into how our users experience the product. After a basic flow was established, I used thumbnail sketches, paper wireframes & stickies to iterate through various navigation and layout approaches.\n\nVisual design\n\nI advocate for the idea of designing a UI style guide to keep consistency across the product & make UI decisions faster. After everyone approval, I started working on the color palette for our UI & then on UI style-guide. I spaced out every\ncomponent right down to every pixel keep things uniform in the product.\n\nI used Sketch to design Hi-fi mockups & final designs. After these wireframes were created, I used InVision to create the first prototype of the app in\norder to start thinking about mobile interactions and gaps in the UX. We were then able to gather feedback from our patients & doctors on the initial set of wireframes, which helped me validate and iterate on ideas quickly & cheaply. I\ndid not have the opportunity to conduct these user tests in person. They were conducted by the offline marketing & field team.\n\nHere are some of the designs I did for MyDermacy & BeYouPlus:\n\nValidating assumptions\n\nAs product creators, we're continuously making assumptions about how users are going to use our product. With both our products MyDermacy & BeYouPlus, we also make a lot of assumptions & it becomes easier to when you have some time to validate\nthese decisions & it's a lot easier to dig into data in a small team. I was also lucky to interact with consumers on a daily basis - through customer support & sales team to have some qualitative insight on the data. Running these small\nsteps has huge value addition & low cost attached to it. I also put some direct calls with our consumers, met doctors & collect user questions from customer support team to identify areas of opportunities in & their pain points with\nour newly realized product.\n\nLaunching is just the starting\n\nAs a designer, my philosophy is make thing obvious while making myself redundant. BeYouPlus, for me, reinforced the importance of empathy & a good process. It's really easy to design good design but really hard to great experiences.\n\nIn a country where doctors and patients still prefer old ways to deal with everyday beauty problems, I had to create and stick to a strict code. And I must say I did a good job of it. I wish I should push more on design be a part of business decisions\n& stuck my ground more while making design decision on behalf of users.", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "8e6c09cf-fd0d-45c2-8209-d8afbc8897e3", "url": "http://nishant.design/work/mydermacy.html"}

That's on my Christmas list. He does sneak in a rear shot though, and I can assure you, as a side note, that that is not a visual delight. You might want to skip that pic.\n\nOn Saturday we abandoned house (knowing anything could happen, but it didn't) and went to London with friends. We all live within an hour of the city but had a day as tourists. Our first stop was The Shard. This is now the tallest building in the European Union with its 73 floors. At the top viewing gallery there is a bar which we availed ourselves of with cups of hot cider. This viewing gallery is open to the elements ( air ) so we experienced an autumnal buffeting, which Mr Him found pleasant.\n\nViews from The Shard\n\nyes, they are trains.\n\nA bit of autumn colour on the trees\n\nLondon Bride station, with trains.\n\nMeandering Thames and Tower Bridge\n\nHMS Belfast\n\nRandom people silhouetted\n\nHaving looked down on the Thames and environs we descended to the underground to go beneath it heading to the Docklands.\n\nHere we mounted the cable car and took a ride across the Thames.\n\nViews from Emirates Airline Cable Car\n\nNext we took the Docklands light railway to travel along the Thames to head for food, and drink.\n\nFirst though a drink or two in Wetherspoons near Tower of London\n\nand then a meal in Bodeans where we ate Kansas City style pulled pork and burnt ends not to mention Key lime pie.\n\nKentucky Bourbon Barrel Ale, the men thought was awesome.\n\nThe only place in the UK I;ve found Key Lime Pie.\n\nNext stop was Camden Town where we experienced being elderly in Cyberdog (A shop of luminous clubbing gear and where Mr Him tends to buy his wardrobe.)\n\nFrom here we needed further beverages to recover from the realisation we're elderly.

The weekend has gone really quickly and I wish I'd had a bit more time re-visiting some of the other places I remember when I lived in Chesham and Caversham. Nevertheless I've had a really enjoyable time of total self-indulgence over the last few days and I'm so glad I made the effort to do the trip.

I decide against bombing down the M4 as I find motorway riding at speed on a bike pretty tedious and hard work bracing against the wind. Instead I join the A4 just outside Sonning and basically follow it all the way to my front door on The London Road (A4) in Bath.\n\nI stop off briefly about half way in Marlborough for a break and a swift pint at The Green Dragon where they are playing Led Zeppelin II and I watch a group of ducks walk by on the pavement (!?).\n\nThe Green Dragon - Marlborough\n\nI pass Silbury Hill near Avebury and the Cherhill White Horse before passing through Calne and Chippenham and finally arriving in Bath early evening.\n\nThe Chervill White Horse & Monument\n\nIt's strange to think that the road right outside my front door leads directly back to where I used to live in the 60's and 70's.

The cottage also comes with 25% reduction in fees for the Dartmouth Golf and Country Club - 10 minutes away.\n\nUnfortunately Oak Cottage is not suitable for STAG or HEN parties or groups of school leavers due to the close proximity of other holiday cottages.\n\nOwner\n\nJude Ferrao 6, 2018\n\nAbout Jude Ferrao\n\nMy sister and I are the owners of Oak Cottage. We are from London, have four boys and two girls between us and family and friends all over the country. We wanted to find a place we could all get together for great family holidays.\nWe bought in a beautiful area with lots to offer so that extended family and friends could get together whenever we wanted in a comfortable, well equipped house that was everything we wanted from our 'home from home'.\nWe have had 16 years of brilliant times at Oak Cottage with loads of wonderful memories. We use it a little less now the kids are older (we now tend to come for shorter breaks with family/friends and my sister has actually moved to Devon) which is why we are renting it out.\nWe want it to be well used and enjoyed as it should be - which seems to be the case judging by the reviews!\n\nJude Ferrao purchased this Cottage in 1999\n\nWhy Jude Ferrao chose Slapton\n\nLiving in London we really wanted somewhere to get away to that was completely different from our everyday surroundings and that we could set up exactly the way we wanted.\nWe had holidayed in this part of the country and loved it - the South Hams area of Devon has beautiful unspoilt English countryside with narrow lanes, high hedges, green fields, quaint villages and you are never far from the stunning coastline and beaches that we love.\nThere are fabulous views, good walking, lovely beaches, golf courses (we are keen golfers), numerous other activities, good pubs and restaurants. Something for everyone whatever the time of year and all in a lovely 'away from it all' setting!\nWe loved this house because of the space and flexibility it offered - 5 bedrooms but also loads of living and entertaining space - it never feels full even with 12 of us there!\n\nWhat makes this Cottage unique\n\nOak Cottage is in a quiet rural setting with other converted cottages. The cottage is very spacious and well equipped and the beautiful 1.5 acre communal garden is there to be enjoyed by everyone complete with brick built BBQ and picnic tables.\nThe games area at the cottage is very popular and there is plenty of other space to spread out and relax. The large kitchen with table and seating for 14 is the hub of the house.\nWe have a great on-site caretaker, Simon, who will help you settle in - he is a font of local knowledge and only too pleased to help and advise. He also breeds Barn Owls and these prove a very popular attraction, the children in particular love to feed them!\nWhile you do need a car you are never far from stunning beaches, fabulous walking, golf, shops, pubs and restaurants and there are plenty of other activities on offer.\n\nEntertainment\n\nThere is a 6' x 3' covered pool table. The top can be reversed to provide a table tennis top - all equipment supplied.\n\nStereo\n\nIpod dock in Reception 2\n\nTelevision\n\nThere are two TVs in the cottage. Both flat screens with freeview. The newer one in the games area is also a Smart TV - but wifi in this part of the counry can be slow to download so plan ahead.\n\nToys\n\nSmall selection of toys for smaller children.\n\nVideo Games\n\nThere is a small selection of PS3 games available.\n\nVideo Library\n\nThere is a selection of DVDs available\n\nOutside\n\nDeck / Patio\n\nThere is outside seating and table (teak) in the courtyard just outside the cottage door.\n\nGolf\n\nThe closest golf course is at the Dartmouth Golf and Country Club which is 15 minutes drive away. This is a stylish club with stunning 18 and 9 hole courses and leisure/spa facilities open to all.\nWe get a 25% discount on green fees and daily membership of the country club which has pool, gym, spa and treatment rooms. There is also a restaurant/bar.\nOther lovely courses/clubs within 30-40 minute drive include Thurlestone, Bigbury, Dainton Park, Churston, Bovey Castle, Elfordleigh and Wrangton\n\nLawn / Garden\n\n1.5 acres of lovely lush communal gardens. Three ponds with ducks so small children and dogs need to be supervised. BBQ, Picnic tables, benches.

The cottage itself was lovely - kitchen was very well equipped, pool table was a big plus and the gardens perfect for relaxing in the sun. The location was great, with several beaches within a 15-20 minute drive.\n\nSubmitted May 19, 2018\n\nBeautiful house we had an amazing stay!\n\n5/5\n\nStayed Mar 2018\n\nHannah C.\n\nThank you so much for such a wonderful stay. We absolutely loved every second. Perfect for the whole family - toddlers right up to Grandparents. We didn't want for anything X\n\nSubmitted Apr 13, 2018\n\nOwner's Response:\n\nThanks Hannah, we are delighted that you all had such a wonderful holiday at Oak Cottage, hope to see you again sometime. Jude\n\nOak Cottage, Buckland Court\n\n4/5\n\nStayed Oct 2017\n\nBrian C.North Bradley, Wiltshire\n\nPerfect half-term week for 6 adults and 5 children. All the facilities needed for the whole party, although one minor glitch - shower in master bedroom takes time for water to empty. Gets close to overflowing. That said, everything else in the property was great. Spent time in Dartmouth, did steam train ride to Paignton from Kingsweir, walked part of the SW coastal path, visited Salcombe (very pretty place), and walked and used the pubs in Slapton and Beesands. A great week enjoyed by all. Driving the roads around the immediate vicinity is a challenge - all single track with passing spaces. Met plenty of vans, lorries, tractors and Chelsea tractors.\n\nSubmitted Oct 30, 2017\n\nOwner's Response:\n\nHi Brian,\n\nThank you so much for your review, we are delighted that you found the cottage provided everything you needed for your large family group over the half term week in Devon - sounds like you really made the most of getting out and about - there is so much to see and do in the area.\n\nThank you very much for letting me know about the shower - no one had mentioned it before so I was unaware there was a problem -we will get the plumber in this week and make sure the shower is draining well again.\n\nWe do hope we can welcome you and the family back sometime.\n\nWith best wishes, Jude\n\nThis was an ideal holiday home for families\n\n5/5\n\nStayed Aug 2017\n\nPenny B.\n\nThis was one of the best equipped houses we have ever visited and we wanted for nothing it catered for everyones needs there was nothing i could fault it with.Simon the caretaker was excellent and was on hand if there was anything we needed or information on surrounding areas etc, I would not hesitate in recommending this to anyone and it is worthy of six stars. Will certainly return.\n\nSubmitted Aug 29, 2017\n\nOwner's Response:\n\nOur first 6 star review! Thank you so much Penny, for a lovely review - we try hard to get it right so love to hear that we have - great to have Simon on site too! We very much look forward to welcoming you and the family back to Oak soon. Best wishes, Jude.\n\nFabulous holiday enjoyed by all the family aged 3-69 yrs.\n\n5/5\n\nStayed Aug 2017\n\nDenise M.\n\nOak Cottage is a fantastic holiday home. Very relaxed home from home feeling on arrival. This spacious house with its large garden was enjoyed by everyone, especially the garden by 4 active children. Cleaniness excellent throughout! Great fully equipped family kitchen. There are several beaches within 30 minutes drive. We would definitely recommend Woodlands Theme Park. Dartmouth, Kingsbridge and Totnes are all within easy distance.\n\nSubmitted Aug 22, 2017\n\nOwner's Response:\n\nThank you very much Denise for leaving a lovely review for Oak Cottage, we are so pleased that you loved the house and found it well equipped and spacious and we are delighted that you enjoyed the garden so much - it is a lovely tranquil spot. Do hope you will visit us again sometime. Best wishes, Jude.\n\nAmazing family holiday!\n\n5/5\n\nStayed Jul 2017\n\nStacey A.\n\nJust got back from a family holiday with 10 of us and 2 dogs!\n\nLeading up to the holiday I cannot fault Jude at all, she responded to my emails quickly and was happy to answer any questions I had!\n\nWhen we arrived there was complimentary tea, coffee, biscuits, cava which was well needed after our journey and a lovely touch!\n\nEverything you could possibly think of has been thought about here and the kitchen is very well equipped!\n\nThe beds are so comfy and every person in each room thought so too! Each bedroom has plenty of storage space.\n\nDownstairs there is enough room to accommodate everyone and has enough space so that you don't feel like you're on top of each other!\n\nThe grounds are stunning and there is a small play area for children.\n\nSimon the caretaker is there to help with anything you need and was more Than happy to show us the baby owls he has been breeding.\n\nWhilst staying here we had lots of days out which were all no more than an hours journey away which was lovely exploring so many different places.\n\nI would highly recommend this cottage for family getaways and it is suitable for children too!\n\nSubmitted Aug 07, 2017\n\nOwner's Response:\n\nThank you so much Stacey for your great review, we are delighted you enjoyed your time at the cottage - we have tried to make it modern and comfortable with plenty of space and things to do for everyone. Those baby owls are amazing as well!\n\nDevon is just such a lovely part of the country anytime of year and sounds like you got out and about and made the most of it.\n\nWe do hope we can welcome you back again sometime in the future.\n\nWith best wishes, Jude and co.\n\n1 - 6 of 35\n\nLocation\n\nKingsbridge, Devon, UK\n\nCoast/Beach:\n\nLots of lovely beaches a short drive away. The closest is 3 mile long Slapton Sands under 10 mins away. 5 mins further towards Dartmouth is Blackpool Sands - a popular Blue Flag beach with restaurant/shop/showers/changing facilities.

From start to finish there was endless booing. I looked through the crowd and couldn't see any Eagles supporters wearing the colours. What's going on here? Could it be that the odd(other) club supporters actually boo?

With little to no summer rain and no rainfall of any substance since January, most crops have gone in dry and needing a good drink to get the out of the ground and growing. Add to that the lack of feed for livestock at the moment and the governments insistence on banning all avenues to international markets through live export, it is tough times in the Ag industry. Do a farmer a favour, make sure you choose WA grown produce at your local supermarket, they could sure use your support! But I digress............\n\nInteresting results last week have left the ladder looking a bit more spaced out, however matches this weekend still have massive significance for the season ahead. We see a changing of the guard at the bottom of the ladder, and at the other end the ladder leaders stamped their authority on the comp in convincing fashion.\n\nWilleton (LLWWL) vs Carlisle (LWWWL)\nBoth teams went into last weeks games away on the back of mini winning streaks, and both left the weekend with a loss against their record. Willeton probably would have won on the weekend if they put in a 4qtr effort, but left themselves too much to do after halftime. Carlisle couldn't follow last weeks effort against the Rams and as a result have lost touch with the top 5. Interesting fixture, the loser potentially slips 2 games outside the top 5 with the winner staying in touch heading into the bye. Willeton by 19.\n\nBassendean (WWLLW) vs Bullcreek (LLLLW)\nBassendean are a bit like Richmond. Seem to look a million bucks against the weaker teams but don't quite live up to their credentials when playing the real finals contenders. They belted struggling Stirling away to regain winning form. Bullcreek took care of Quinns to register their first win and with that, leapfrog them on the ladder to 9th. By all reports they sacked their coach during the week, and as we have seen in the AFL that can generate a response from the playing group. Also having a WAFL listed player coming back from injury play and kick 7 helps ! Up against better opposition this weekend so look forward to seeing if they have turned a corner. I think not. Basso by 68.\n\nBallajura (WWWWW) vs Kenwick (WLLWW)\nNot a bad form line for Balla, and against some quality oppposition. Don't need to say much else, I think we all expected this and the loss in round 2 is s distant memory. Kenwick are the giant killers however, and have been known to topple a ladder leader. Come in with good form also with a couple of wins, but this is next level. Sitting 4th on the ladder and would be pretty happy with their work thus far but can't see them winning this one. Ballajura by 27.\n\nGosnells (WWWLL) vs Stirling (WLLLL)\nGosnells must be wondering what is happening, back to back losses??! What is this strange phenomenon. Comprehensive loss on the weekend to Ballajura also has probably given them an idea on where they are at, or where they need to be, in C1. Stirling are going terribly, I won't repeat what I normally say, refer to older posts and paste in here. Away to Gosnells, who would be stinging after the last 2 weeks, this will get ugly. Gosnells by 70+.\nQuinns (LLLWL) vs Melville (LWWLW)\nOld foes, played in a GF against each other 3 years ago but their tales since then have been a mixed bag. Quinns would have had every right to go into last weeks game confident, but were belted if we are honest. Think they got the Creek on a bad day however so I tend not to read into it as much. Melville were at their best for the first 2 qtrs last week, before reverting back to their worst for 30 mins until a late burst sealed the win. Their wins won't have done much to quiet the doubters, both internally and externally, until they can string together 4 qtr efforts for multiple games in a row. Don't think Melville have every won at Ridgewood, but I expect that to change this weekend. Melville by 11.\n\nHave a great weekend all, put everything into is as you have a week off to recover. Good luck also to whoever is competing in the HBF run on Sunday. If you see me during the 12km say hi. I will be the one wearing the HBF Run for a Reason singlet, starting in group B.]]>WA - Amateurs (WAAFL)Thu, 24 May 2018 05:14:04 +0000A Grade Round 8 - by: Mr Mysterious\n\nWe start with some sad news though and that is the departure of Boothead, we all know moving to Darwin is a nice facade, but in reality MrM using his OzFooty privilege (like parliamentary privilege) will say he thinks you have been given the cease and desist from the club in which you are involved. I for one liked your opinions Boothead sir however MrM can clear a few things up. MrM does enjoy how you called him big fella, however standing a shade less than 6 foot tall and having the body size of a pre pubescent teenager would lead one to believe nothing about me is big. MrM never has quiet ones either; however I know those who wear teal enjoy a nice shandy, so I shall indulge if we ever meet.\nOf course you can have input, when MrM was studying abroad last season he was voted best poster in all football forums (one vote was cast, my own) so join in form time to time.\nLastly, MrM is very much looking forward to this weekend and quite sad you will not be able to join in this day. MrM had something very special planned as well, but he might keep that under lock and key for now. This also means you miss out on MrM's special offer coming soon, you loss Boothead, our more importantly our loss!\n\nAlright let us look at football, I suppose.\n\nScarborough v Curtin Uni Wesley @Abbett Park\n\nIf the rain predicted comes in Friday and Saturday then I look forward to seeing this game played underwater as Abbett Park is prone to flooding...don't believe MrM, just wait and see.\nScarborough will be disappointed losing last weekend and will want to make up for that in a big way, but they do face a Curtin Uni side who is desperate to win as well. It hasn't been an easy season for Curtin Uni, but I expect them to come out and show plenty of effort here. They will still fall short though, but will be closer than I expect.\nScarborough by 4 goals\n\nWembley v North Beach @Pat Goodridge Reserve\n\nWembley got themselves a good win last weekend and will be hoping to replicate that form this weekend but as well per usual they may have all their good form stopped by a team that is on a roll. North Beach was very good last weekend and moved the ball very well. If they can play like that this weekend I expect them to walk away winners once more.\nNorth Beach by 4 goals\n\nKalamunda v Trinity Aquinas @Ray Owen Reserve\n\nThis is a big game for Kalamunda if they are to make anything of their season they will definitely need a good showing against a quality opponent in Trinity Aquinas. They will need to stop the supply to the dominant TA's forward line if they are to win. TA's are starting to string some good wins together and this weekend may loom as a danger game for them. I do expect them to win here though.\nTrinity Aquinas by 6 goals\n\nUniversity v Fremantle CBC @UWA Sports Park\n\nIn a game MrM nearly awarded Match Of The Round to, MrM is looking forward to a good battle here. University had a very good first half against Kingsway last weekend and will want to replicate that if they are any chance to defeat the unbeaten Freo CBC here. Fremantle CBC, currently undefeated and are flying, who will knock them off first is anyone's guess, however MrM thinks it could be this weekened...When MrM says could be, it won't be as he is going with form.\nFremantle CBC by 3 goals\n\nWanneroo v Kingsway @Wanneroo ShowgroundsMOTR\n\nWell this game has everything, Mayors Cup, Grand Final Rematch and the battle of the Roo which is why it is this weekend's Match Of The Round.\nWanneroo were not so good last weekend and will want to perform better when they face a tough side in Kingsway this weekend. Kingsway haven't had the greatest introduction to A grade, but things may turn for them. It promises to be a very good contest and MrM is looking forward to see how both sides match up and given the usual animosity towards each other, added in Past Players Day at Wanneroo, doubled with Wanneroo 3rd'4th sides having a bye and just like nuts on a strawberry sundae, finishing with a huge night game the grandstand will be full. MrM think it will be grand.\nWanneroo by 3 goals\n\nGood luck all.

Two sides who are cellar dwellers.I think they went over board with their jubilation.The week just gone, they get smashed by a top eight side .A side that has a chance of being top four.Down comes the sky.Every man and his dog are heaping scorn on the team.A tough gig this AFL.\nEssendon smashed the previous week by Carlton.They cop a fair dinkum pelting from all and sundry.This week they smash Geelong and out come the slammers from the week before to heap praise on them.A tough gig this AFL.\nTake another case in point,the Fremantle Dockers.Sitting four and five after the weekend.No body expected the Dockers to be at an almost even keel at this stage of the season.Their losses have been away, but for the Eagles game.They have away sides that are either in the top four, or eight all except the Giants.But make no mistake , they will be top eight and maybe top four contenders around finals time.And a point that maybe a lot have missed, is that aside from the Eagles losing to Sydney in the opening game of the season, the Dockers have run the Eagles the closest of all other sides that they have beaten.A tough gig this AFL\nI write a little skit every week on my FB page.Making predictions as to who will win and lose and why.Hard to get people to respond much except when there is a selection that readers, I assume there are some,who have a crack about my dislike for a side.They come over in droves when their side has a win,but never say well selected when they lose and I have selected them.

It was hard fought and close at the half way break but Souths came out after the long break and played with that much more purpose and kicked a the goals that mattered. In the last quarter the Royals got back and t time looked like the could catch and pass the Bullies but time ran out, well done to both teams for a game that was fast and direct. Souths ball winners were that much more prolific than ours and it showed. Well done to the Hammer for another strong game.\n\nThe Ressies was also a game in two halves with the East Perth boys coming out on top after a dominate second half. The game was quick, direct and showed a high standard of skills. I was pleased to see the East Perth boys play like they did as it reinforces to me that we have a group that will be challengers for the flag this year. Well done to Dobbo, Jaxon Cahill and Stan Wright but for me the plaudits must go to the backline who controlled Souths for much of the game and allowed the mids and forward to capatilise!]]>East PerthSat, 19 May 2018 23:31:59 +0000Umpiring 2018 - by: PD1899\n\nI understand every supporter is passionate and as a general rule sees the game from a one eyed perspective. I have paid particular attention to umpire stats over the past few years and found one indisputable fact - the umpires pay soft free kicks in the last quarter of games to balance up the one sided free kick counts. Although I thought the umpiring was very good Perth V West Perth game, it was very clear they made up the number late in the game. They did the same with the Perth V East Perth game but the umpiring was terrible and caused a lot of player and supporter frustration.. I did not see the Tigers v Demons game today and can only base my judgement on the radio commentators who were very amused at numerous mistakes made by the so called unbiased adjudicators. All funny enough of the comments were to the detriment of the Perth team. The count at one stage of the game was 22 to 3 in favour of the Tigers and the umpires managed to bring that back in the last quarter to 27 to 15.PerthSat, 19 May 2018 14:36:18A thriller: Peel vs Subiaco - by: swan42\n\n\nthe umpire bounces the ball to start the first quarter.]]>WAFL General ChatSat, 19 May 2018 08:26:58 +0000Sydney and Melbourne racecallers - by: swan42\n NewsSat, 19 May 2018 05:24:28 +0000Toasters V Tiggers. - by: anchorman\n\nThese two sides are , at the moment, the best in the competition.Both sides strong all over the ground.\nThe Tigers will miss Nankervis if he doesn't play.

Melville had one to forget last week playing a stinker away to Carlisle. You only have to look at their form line to see consistency is not their strong point, and with those wins coming with margins of 5, 6 and 5 there was an element of luck. Willeton came up against lowly Bullcreek and got the job done to register consecutive wins for the first time this year. They pushed Balla all the way in their most recent loss so have a great form line. On paper Willeton are probably the better side, but Melville are a significantly better side at home, and for that reason they have my tip by 11pts.\n\nBullcreek (LLLLL) vs Quinns (LLLLW)\nCouple of sides struggling but lots to play for in this one. With another loss Bullcreek go 2 games clear on bottom and almost a certainty to be relegated on current form given they would be at least 3 wins away from 8th other results pending. For Quinns, they could go 2 clear of last or fall 2 games behind safety. Good win last week by the Bulls which would have given them some confidence. Quinns by 9pts for me.\n\nBallajura (WWWWW) vs Gosnells (WWWWL)\nWho would have seen that Gosnells loss at home at the weekend coming? Definitely not me and I bet Mills Park was loud until the wee hours of the morning after that one. Ballajura took care of Bassendean in pretty easy fashion to extend their winning streak and don't seem to have broken a sweat since round 2. MOTR obviously with 1 vs 2, but a pretty easy tip in my view with Balla flexing their muscles and will inflct Gosnells their second loss of the season and 3rd in 18 months. Balla by 18pts.\n\nKenwick (WWLLW) vs Carlise (LLWWW)\nCarlisle are on a bit of a winning streak, and made Melville look second rate on the weekend. Kenwick off the back of a close loss the previous week pulled off the upset of the season against old foe Gosnells. Bit like Eagles vs Richmond, this looked like a nothing fixture 4 rounds ago but now shapes as an absolute cracker and potential MOTR. I'm going to tip based on home ground advantage, Kenwick by 11 points.\n\nStriling (WWLLL) vs Bassendean (WWWLL)\nBoth sides tell a tale of 2 halves of a season. Both started like a house on fire, both have found the last 3 and 2 weeks respectively a bit of a reality check. Stirlings depth was always going to be tested, 41 players have been used in their league team, the most of any club. And when you have no colts and reserves are averaging 100pt losses that makes things hard. Basso have just come up against the benchmark of the competition the last 2 weeks and haven't been good enough. They enter a stretch of more winnable games now which will buoy them with confidence. Balla too strong in this one, 25pts.\n\nBest of luck for the weekend everyone. Cannot wait to see the results and what the ladder looks like in the aftermath. What a day we have Sunday too, there is no better way to close out the weekend than with the West Coast vs Richmond clash which should be match of the season so far. Eagles for me in this one by 11 pts.]]>WA - Amateurs (WAAFL)Thu, 17 May 2018 06:12:44 +0000B Grade and Hamersley Carine - by: Hawk Eye\n - Amateurs (WAAFL)Wed, 16 May 2018 13:13:15 +0000A Grade Rd7 - by: boothead\n Trinity Aquinas vs Curtin Uni Wesley @Billy Grayden\nThis game is huge for either side here, TA's want to keep in the five whilst Curtin would love to go a game clearer of the relegation zone. Trinity Aquinas had a good win last week against a wembley side who are really struggling, but with Ryan Murphy back to his best with six last week they will feel confident going into this week. Curtin had yet another tough week at the office with another heavy defeat against CBC, they need to find the scoreboard to win this game and again i cant see it happening. Trinity Aquinas by 4 Goals\n\nNorth Beach vs Wanneroo @Chas Riley\nOn any other week this game would be the match of the round, but its going to have to settle for second best. Wanneroo kept on keeping on last week with a big win over Kalamunda at home and just keep affirming each week that they are the real deal. North Beach got back on the winners list against Uni and were never really troubled on their way to a nine goal win. This could go either way but i like the home side. North Beach by 3 Goals\n\nKingsway vs University @Kingsway\nAnother really interesting game here, Kingsway and University will both see this one as a winnable encounter. Kingsway had their recent run of form stopped by a powerful Scarborough outfit but will return home believing that this is a big chance for a win. University have been very up and down in recent weeks after beating TA's they have lacked that consitiency and will be looking to pick up a good scalp away from home. Kingsway by 2 Goals\n\nFremantle CBC vs Scarborough @Morris Buzzacott MOTR\nWell here it is, the match of the season so far between two unbeaten sides. Fremantle CBC kept on keeping on easily dismantling Curtin last week and their midfield is seriously firing at the moment. Scarborough have been untouchable in the first six rounds and have won every game by over 5 goals, and with their wealth of WAFL experience they are a hard train to stop. This will be a thriller. Scarborough by 1 Goal\n\nKalamunda vs Wembley @Ray Owen\nThis game also has an argument to be match of the round with both sides looking to exit the relegation zone and put pressure on Curtin and Kingsway. Kalamunda were okay in patches last week against Wanneroo and back at Ray Owen will know that if they can get somewhere near their best they will be a big chance. Wembley had one of their best showings in a few weeks against TA's where they pushed them all day and will fancy themselves to win at last. Kalamunda by 2 Goals\n\nEnjoy this blockbuster round.\nBoothead out ]]>WA - Amateurs (WAAFL)Wed, 16 May 2018 09:32:30 +0000Was Hawkins sold a lemon!!! - by: anchorman\n\nWind the tape forward one week, and we see three players get reported for man handling an umpire.Stephen May from the Suns and Ed and Charlie Curnow from Carlton.\nAll three get a $1,000 fine.\nNow the May fine I can sort of understand as he was appealing a free kick given against him .He made contact for sure , but nothing malicious in it, or I don't think intentional in it.But that is open to discussion.\nThen we get to the Blues Brothers.Ed made a full on hand in the chest of an umpire.He knew who he was touching.Almost looked like he pushed him aside as happens between players.To do that to a player is ok, but not to an umpire.\nCharlie actually looks like he pushes the umpire out of the way so he can get into a pack that had formed on the ground.He also to me looks like he is shielding the umpire from getting in to break up the pack.\nWhat do these panel members think of when making these decisions!!!!Do they forget tabout the previous week and their threat!!!\nTom and Geelong were sold a lemon.]]>AFL General ChatWed, 16 May 2018 09:29:46 +000019th May.

They have had a few disappointing performances against Subiaco and West Perth but they have been good in all the other matches and at 3 wins 3 losses are well placed to push for a finals spot at this stage.\n\nPalmer and Payne seem to have added depth to the midfield, Palmer has shown his class in a few games. Ellard had a slow start to the season due to injury but he will build as the season goes on. Gault is going from strength to strength and is the guy we could least afford to lose with injury IMO.\n\nOf the younger brigade Tobe Watson, Warwick WIlson and Braydon Hackett all appear to have improved from 2017 and are now more or less in the team every week. On the other hand Adam Faulkner seems to have fallen out of favour and is no longer in the best 22.\n\nThe three weeks after the bye see us playing East Perth at Leederville, Perth at Bassendean and Claremont at Claremont. Ideally we would like to win a minimum of 2 of those 3 games to keep our win/loss ratio over 50%. I think this is well within the ability of this group, the only misgiving I would have is that our record at Leederville and Claremont (Showgrounds or Oval) over the last 4 or 5 years has been pretty poor.]]>Swan DistrictsMon, 14 May 2018 10:59:41 +0000Tribunal results - by: swan42\n General ChatMon, 14 May 2018 10:53:14 +0000Vale Wayne Orsi - by: Mr AFL\n\nCondolences to his family and friends.]]>WAFL General ChatMon, 14 May 2018 10:33:11 +0000S v FART - by: BC\n 14 May 2018 05:22:35 +0000Round Seven 2018 vs Claremont - by: Mr AFL\n\nI'm hoping that Mitch Lague and Devin McFarlane will be available.

Cant blame the weather, teams doing the right things defensively!\n\n(I'm adding a 5 game form line next to teams names from now on)\n\nQuinns (LLLLL) vs Sttriling (WWWLL)\nThats a lot of L's for Quinn's, and would feel strange for a usually successful and consistent club. Stirling have hit a wall after looking good for the first 3 weeks, comprehensively beaten in the last 2 rounds. At home, Quinns will be too good in this one, I'm tipping them to get their first win by 24 points. They will sweep the day, reserves comfortably too.\n\nCarlisle (LLLWW) vs Melville (LWLWW)\nProbably the two hardest teams to pick this year. Carlise started the year terribly losing the first 3, but came back with 2 solid wins. Melville looked gone after a dismal round 1 against Gosnells, but have found form the last month with their only loss by 2 points away to Stirling. Tough one to tip, will be a goal either way I would suspect. Melville by 3 points.\n\nGosnells (WWWWW) vs Kenwick (LWWLL)\nHow can I tip against Gosnells? Especially at home? With all the off-field issues plaguing them the last month they just continue to get it done on Saturdays and are the only remaining undefeated team. Kenwick are similar to Stirling in the fact that they have a competitive core group of league players, but will struggle for depth when calling upon their reserves. Probably could have just stopped after the first sentence. Gosnells by 74, their reserves by 150.\n\nBassendean (WWWWL) vs Ballajura (WLWWW)\nTwo teams 4-1, and this will be a cracker ! Looking forward to the results from this, Basso started the year on fire but fell at their first real hurdle last week and come up against another one this week. Ballajura continuing on their merry way, after dropping that round 2 clash to Melville they have regained the confidence of tipsters who had them as flag contenders pre-season. I'm tipping Ballajura in this MOTR by 11 points.\n\nWilleton (WLLLW) vs Bullcreek (LLLLL)\nWilleton join Melville and Carlisle as the mid-pack sides after 5 rounds who on their day could probably win against anyone, but capable of losing the un-loseable. Bullcreek are in big trouble, without a win, 2 games clear of relegation safety. Looking forward their next 3 matches against Quinns, Basso and Gosnells could seal their fate by round 10. They are a real possiblity of being 0-9 and 3 games clear of 9th spot. With Quinns a big sniff, they could be the only team without a win come 6pm Saturday. Willeton easily in this one I suspect, 22 points.\n\nHave a great weekend everyone, and happy mother day to all the mums out there !]]>WA - Amateurs (WAAFL)Fri, 11 May 2018 02:44:45 +0000Schofield on the move - by: BC\n\nthewest.com.au/sport/wafl/subiaco-coach-...elaide-ng-b88831169z\n]]>SubiacoFri, 11 May 2018 01:43:11 +0000Lyon Secret Tape.. - by: Bazza\n\nJust watching Sky News...someone said urgent board meeting being held and Lyons days are numbered...??\n\nNo idea whats on it.]]>AFL General ChatWed, 09 May 2018 14:15:53 +0000A Grade Round 6 - by: boothead\n Scarborough vs Kingsway @Abbett Park (MOTR)\nI chose this game as the match of the round as both these sides are in form and this could be closer then what you think. Kingsway come off a sensational performance last week against a rather poor Curtin side, they moved the ball with ease & their forwards were unstoppable. Whereas Scarborough just kept on keeping on claiming a big scalp against bitter rivals North Beach, they move to a temporary home ground this week where they will have to adapt. Scarborough by 2 Goals.\n\nWembley vs Trinity Aquinas @Pat Goodridge\nBoth these sides really need a win and this game is shaping up as one which could really shape the competition. Wembley come into the game after being blown away by wanneroo and find themselves five rounds in with only one win to take for it. Trinity Aquinas suprisingly are 2&3 and need to find a win here to stay in touch with the top 5. Trinity will be too strong here. Trinity Aquinas by 5 Goals.\n\nCurtin Uni Wesley vs Fremantle CBC @South Oval\nA battle between two sides on opposite sides of the ladder with very different form. Fremantle CBC are flying at the moment and find themselves unbeaten after five with a very attractive brand of football. Curtins brand of football at the moment is certainly not attractive, a hundred point hiding from a side who had previously not won is a key indicator of that (Not to say they didnt have several players out). Curtin need to show something here but it would result in a victory. Fremantle CBC by 7 Goals\n\nWanneroo vs Kalamunda @Showgrounds\nAnother battle between two very differently placed teams, and a game in which both sides need to find some form. Wanneroo have been extremely impressive this year and claimed their first scalp away from home in convincing style against a disappointing wembley side. Kalamunda are seriously struggling at the moment but will take a fair bit out of their showing last week after coming within two kicks against University. This week however will be very different at the Showgrounds. Wanneroo by 12 Goals.\n\nUniversity vs North Beach @McGillvrary\nBoth North Beach and University have struggled with their consistency so far this season and both will be looking to change that this week. North Beach had a bit of a reality check last week against the pole leaders of the competition and will realise that they need a bit of improvement to go deep into finals.

Instead of congratulating Hewitt for providing on-court guidance and the benefit of his experience Langdon takes him to task for doing what many sportsmen in the past have done and made a comeback. Hewitt's motivation in playing with de Minaur is not money but fast-tracking a promising young Australian player's development.

Our office is open M – F from 8:30am – 4:30pm.\n\nRecently we said goodbye to AJ Imbach, our Thrift Store manager. As we were sad to see him leave, we were also wondering what God had in store for our ministry. We had been so excited about the arrival of AJ and all his fresh ideas for our thrift stores. But God quickly responded and brought a new manager to our thrift stores.\n\nWe are excited to welcome Nelson Clippinger to The Hope Center team!\n\nNelson is not exactly brand new to this ministry though. While this is his first time being employed with us, a few years ago Nelson served on our Board of Directors.\n\nNelson and his wife Cindy live in Chambersburg, PA. A carpenter by trade, Nelson has also worked as an Estimator and Project Manager for several construction firms in the area. In addition to that, he was a manager at True Value store and has worked at several other stores in the area. He's bringing a lot of experience to the Thrift Stores manager position at The Hope Center.\n\nAfter being laid off from his last job, Nelson was in the process of looking for a new job when he came across The Hope Center ad for the Thrift Store manager position. After going through the application and interview process, and after much prayer, Nelson was happy to receive the job offer.\n\nHaving already served as a member of our Board, Nelson had a good understanding of this ministry. But now being a staff member has really given him the opportunity to see how God is truly working at this ministry. He says that this job has been a blessing to him personally and the opportunity to work with the staff has been a \"rewarding experience both spiritually and mentally.\"\n\nEach morning before the Hagerstown Thrift Store opens, the staff has a time of prayer to start the day. Nelson said, \"it is such a blessing to hear our resident and graduate workers pray. Truly their lives have been changed and I feel they touch all who enter the doors of the thrift store.\"\n\nWe are so happy God brought Nelson to fill the void at the Thrift Stores. We are excited to see how he will use his experience to enhance both of our stores.\n\nWhen shopping at our stores, take time to welcome Nelson to the team. And continue to pray for Nelson and the other staff at our Thrift Stores. Our stores are a very vital part of this ministry. Proceeds from the store sales help to fund all the many ministries and projects at The Hope Center. So many lives have been helped, transformed and touched because of people who have donated, shopped and worked at our Thrift Stores.\n\nIf you have gently used items that you would like to donate, please call 301.739.1165 to get more information about how you can give your things to help change lives in Hagerstown.\n\nIf you haven't stopped by one of our two Thrift Stores lately, now's the perfect time to do so! We hope to see you soon! Here are the addresses to both stores:\n\nEvery now and again God sends people into your life who just make an instant impact. Sometimes these people are for the good and other times it's for the bad.\n\nWhen God brought AJ Imbach and his wife, Jayne, to Hagerstown from Oregon, we had no idea how quickly we would love having them around. These two made such an incredible impact on so many, from staff, to guests, to customers, AJ & Jayne were a welcomed pair to The Hope Center family.\n\nAJ was hired to be the manager of our Thrift Stores in Hagerstown & Chambersburg. He brought with him not only experience, but a passion to serve the Lord and a kindness very rarely seen in this world.\n\nAs soon as AJ started his ministry, he fit right in. And his wife, Jayne, became a fixture at The Hope Center too. She was always volunteering and helping in various ways around the ministry. Her smile and love of people was infectious.\n\nBut it wasn't easy for them to just move across the country. They were leaving family, friends, and a good job in Portland, Oregon. It was very hard for Jayne but she believed, as AJ did, that this was God's calling and she obeyed.\n\nAJ was a wonderful addition to The Hope Center family. His leadership in our stores was well received by all the staff. He lead by example and his goal as manager was to create a working environment where the staff could excel in their jobs. He quickly jumped in, coming up with new ideas and creative ways to get shoppers into our stores.\n\nApproximately a month after he began managing the stores AJ experienced some physical symptoms that he had never felt before and he found a primary care physician who referred him to a neurologist.\n\nAfter many tests, the neurologist made an initial diagnosis of ALS but referred AJ to Johns Hopkins for a second opinion.\n\nIn early January AJ received confirmation from Johns Hopkins that it was ALS. All his doctors agreed that AJ and Jayne should return to their home in Portland, OR where they would have a large support system of family and friends to help Jayne provide the care AJ will need as the disease progresses.\n\nAJ and Jayne felt the call from God to come to Hagerstown, and they struggled with having to make a decision to stay or return to Portland. AJ called his job here at The Hope Center \"my dream job.\" He loved what he was doing and he was loved by our Hope Center family.\n\nThroughout this entire ordeal AJ and Jayne did not waver in their faith and trust in God. They have returned to Portland and AJ is receiving care from a doctor who specializes in ALS. AJ believes that God is trustworthy, and he stands on God's Word that says, \"And my God will meet all your needs according to his glorious riches in Christ Jesus.\" Philippians 4:13\n\nWe are grateful that God allowed our paths to cross and although AJ and Jayne were only here for a short time they touched many lives and their faith and trust in God made a huge impact on everyone they came in contact with.\n\nThis situation reminds us that our lives on earth are fleeting, like a vapor in the wind, but the impact of our service to God and the kindness, compassion and joy of following Christ is what will live on.\n\nAJ & Jayne definitely have left a legacy here. Even though they are all the way across the country, their joy & faithfulness is still here as an example to all of us how to trust God through the good times and the bad.\n\nPlease join us in praying for both of these amazing people. We, along with every person who has come in contact with AJ & Jayne, don't understand why this is happening. But God knows. And He cares. And we know that through all of these trials, AJ & Jayne will continue to praise God and impact lives for Him.\n\nAJ & Jayne, thank you so much for your service, but more importantly, your friendship. You both will always be a part of The Hope Center family!\n\nThe good news is that people are shopping our thrift stores and finding some very good buys in our furniture department!\n\nThe bad news is we are in urgent need of gently used furniture donations. Beds, mattresses & box springs, couches, chairs, dining sets, tables, bookcases, etc. We will gladly accept all donations of furniture in good condition.\n\nAs you start to dream about spring or prepare to clean out your house, consider donating your used furniture and household items to The Hope Center. When you donate, these items are placed in our Thrift Stores in Hagerstown & Chambersburg for neighbors on a tight budget. Your used furniture could be just the thing that another family needs to get back on their feet.\n\nDonations are accepted at our Hagerstown Thrift Store during regular store hours Mon-Sat 9AM-5PM. The Hagerstown Thrift Store is located on the corner of Church and Walnut Streets in Hagerstown. The drop-off location for furniture is located at the backside of the store close to the Trinity Center in the central parking lot.\n\nIf you are unable to bring your furniture to our Hagerstown Thrift Store, we will gladly come to get it for you!

She was returning the scooter into the store for my Papa last Friday. (Above) How cute is this boy???\n\n(Below) Papa and Braxton coloring at the restaurant last week!\n\nOkay, so it has been a week... sorry I haven't been updating people :) Here it is... I went in Tuesday night to the hospital for a stress test (the baby, not me :) and I was having some contractions, but couldn't feel them... I wish I had that the first time! Then On Wednesday I went in for my Ultrasound to check the pressure on the cord, because that is what the Doctor was worried about last week, and all looks better! He gained weight also, they think he is about 5.12... give or take 2 pounds! Yesterday I went in for my reg check up with my midwife (who I LOVE) and I am a two centimeters along, that is when I went to the hospital with Brax last time :) I can't sleep anymore! Not because of the heartburn and \"bigness\"... but I am just so exited and anxious... When When When?? Alberto Is worried I won't love this one as much as I love Brax, he is probably right :) Kidding!!!! Parents do it all the time right? Don't you just grow more love? Well I go in again for my next stress test on Saturday morning and they will check little Oliver's heartbeat, for contractions and movement then we wait some more! Can you believe this is almost over? This really has been the fastest 9 months EVER!! I can't wait :)\n\nWednesday, April 15, 2009\n\nSo our baby boy might be making an early entrance people... Our sweet doc said maybe as early as next week... but we will know more at our Friday ultra sound. I also got my NEW CAR!!!!!! I LOVE LOVE LOVE her!!! Any name Ideas?? She is a silver 2005 Honda Pilot, an 8 seater with Braxtons Fav, a DVD player! We are very in love already... Thank you Alberto!!!\n\nSaturday, April 11, 2009\n\nWe are all waiting for him... but it really is going fast... faster than my first little guy :) I think because I am running all over with the first one! Braxton has become the \"official\" thing picker upper, because I can no longer bend easily to pick up dropped keys, papers, toys etc. ( I can still bend, just not easily :) He is already such an AMAZING helper! Every day it seems Alberto and I look at him and stand there thinking when did he turn into a little boy... he is no longer our little baby/toddler... I wonder how different these two kids will be. Braxton is so sweet, patient, always wants to help, and can tell right away if some one is upset and wants to make them feel better. His feeling get hurt easily, and it is the sadist thing EVER when he says, \"I'm sad\" while his eyes fill with tears... It breaks your heart! How do you love your second as much as your first?? Alberto and I laugh, because my older Brother Jason is/was the mellow one... and I am/was NOT, I was a pain in the you know what... and Alberto's older sister Daniela was the mellow one and Alberto was (is) not. At all :) We think, poor Braxton, if this \"older child/younger child\" pattern continues.\n\nMonday, April 6, 2009\n\nBraxton and I got out on Friday afternoon and planted flowers and cleaned out all our planter boxes :) I told my mommy I was not going to do any gardening this year... except for my flower boxes, but when the sun comes out... the garden seems to draw you to it, saying \"Do something to me! Make me beautiful!!\" And here are some of my fav pics from this first week in sunny April!", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "c5d33ae3-bcc5-428c-a304-2f09ae86f8b1", "url": "http://braxtonsmommy.blogspot.com/2009/04/"}

As mentioned on the lisiting I do try to give my guests a lot of privacy and make them feel like they have the whole apartment to themselves. Another reason you saw very little of me is because I do have another property in Canberra. While I love to socialise with my guests, not all guests prefer that and some like to be left to their own devices hence I try to cater to that. Besides I'm always reachable on my mobile or via airbnb site if a guest needed to reach me hence it would have been nice had you indicated your preference for more interaction with the host rather giving us a low rating for it after you had already left, which I honestly find a bit harsh espcially considering I did check in with you during your stay and you said everything was good and up to your expectations.

They are so pretty. Easy to apply. I have only had mine on for a day and a half but had to write a review now because I really LOVE them. They have held up through two showers so far. I am careful not to scrub over them while bathing. My only complaint is that they are way too short. I can only use them on my wrist. I would like to put one around my upper arm as a cuff but not long enough. I would give 5 starts if they were longer. I found these in the QVC Beauty Summer Must-Haves 6-piece Collection. I like them so much that I am going to look for more. Fortunately I live in a hot climate where I wear shorts and sleeveless tops for most of the year so I can wear these tattoos often.

The shirt and skirt had clear plastic pockets on the front, and in the back of the box there was a cardboard sheet of pop-out pictures to go in the pockets. I got her for Christmas when I was…I think 5, which was in 1999. The Picture Pocket Barbies were available, if I remember correctly, from when I was about 4 to 6 years old, so 1998 to 2000.

I did 2 hours 30mins at about 260watts then headed straight to the track for the session. After a quick sandwich (which I regreted eating) I did the track warmup and felt less than average. The session was mainly sprint work and flying lap practice but there was a standing kilo towards the end. The kilo always finishes me of and when I had that done I thought I was finished, no such luck, Andy's 'Bonus session' was next.

{"text": "Pages\n\nFriday, December 13, 2013\n\nFive on Friday\n\nOne. Next Appointment Today is my next ultrasound appointment at 4 in Peoria. They will look to make sure the injections are doing what they're supposed to and more follicles are growing. I'm thinking about this time next week I will be having the IUI procedure done again, hopefully this time with positive results. I can't believe that when I started this blog about my pregnancy journey over a year and a half later I would be writing about giving myself injections of hormones, & having all these procedures done to treat infertility. We never know where life is going to take us, but this journey has been quite the experience & I know in the end it will all end up being worth it.\n\nTwo. Holiday Lull This week and next week, we really have hardly anything going on and I'm totally OK with that!! It's been down in the single digits here in Illinois along with snow & ice & crappy weather that I hate having to go out in. I'm perfectly content going home after work, immediately putting on sweats, & relaxing the evenings away with my husband and dog. Soon the days will be filled with lots of travel, chaos, laughing, present giving, Christmas fun, but I'm glad that these next couple of weeks are quiet. We have dinner plans on Saturday for our friend's birthday, but that's pretty much it as far as the weekend goes.\n\nmy husband, my dog, my beautiful tree & the crazy finale of SOA\n\nThree. Crane Humidifier\n\nYep, it's that time of year when the air is so unbelievably dry that my nails are breaking, my skin is scaly, and my nose just hurts. We used to run a humidifier in our bedroom all winter long in our old house, but we could never find the right filters to change it. I ended up buying the Crane Humidifier & I'm so in love with it. It's sooo quiet, you can't hear it running at all except for the gargle of water every once in a while & I'm not waking up with a dry nose anymore. Highly recommend this product as I know Jessica @ Little Baby Garvin does as well.\n\nFour. Christmas Mugs Last Friday we had to drive to Bloomington, about an hour away, to go see Out of the Furnace (HIGHLY recommend!) so I made Joe take me to Cracker Barrel to get my chicken n dumplins' fix. I love their store, they have some of the cutest most unique things there. A great place to do a little Christmas shopping, which I definitely did. While there I found these adorable mugs that I just had to have. They were cheap, & cute. I love the vintage look of them. They would be perfect for hot chocolate with some whip cream and mallows on top. I've got a pretty large collection of Christmas mugs since we always get one in our stocking every year. These would make great gifts for the person who loves all-things Christmas, or the hard-to-buy-for person with some hot chocolate packets included!\n\nFive. Family Traditions I've seen a lot of posts in blogland lately about traditions, some of the headaches that are caused by breaking tradition, creating new traditions with our new families, tweaking traditions that we already have with our families to accommodate for our spouses families, etc. I think it's important to create a balance between keeping old traditions & making new ones. We still go to Joe's parents Christmas Eve & put our matching PJ's on and read Christmas stories & drink Coke's out of glass bottles, we still go to my parents Christmas and have breakfast & open gifts. But once our house is built & it's filled with kids, things will eventually change. My parents were divorced when I was two. I went between houses my whole life, & it didn't bother me at all, but I don't want to have to drag my kids around during the holidays & try to get to see everyone & have to rush to make sure we make all of our stops. I want to be able to savor every moment that I can with them & with family. I hope that our families will be understanding of this. I hope that we can keep some old & create some new. How do you balance old & new traditions during the holidays?", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "5c946adc-b43a-424c-8075-bb9fa614171e", "url": "http://www.babyridleybump.com/2013/12/five-on-friday_13.html"}

{"text": "BFTE Makeup\n\nBeauty From The Earth or BFTE Cosmetics is a brand that has been around a while but has recently been bought out my a lovely friend of mine. I had never given it a go before and I am so glad that I finally did. I have been using these products for months now. I started playing with these products around November and have been really digging in.\n\nI love all of the eyeshadows that they come out with month after month, but I think I am most excited about their mineral foundation. There are 11 shades in the line with an option to mix them for a Custom Blend. I tried out 5 small sample jars (that were $2 each) to find a match for myself and none of them were spot on, but I had a good grasp from the samples which shades mixed together would work for me and they blended it for me and it was everything!\n\nI use the mineral foundation like it is meant to be used but also as concealer and it layers really well. It really evens out my skintone and counteracts all my redness very easily.\n\nAnd just take a look at these gorgeous eyeshadows! The one on the far right is my favorite. It is such an interesting color. It is a red bronzy brown and it is called Stuff It! I believe it was LE and no longer available but I still wanted to show you how gorgeous it is, which is true throughout the entire selection of shades!\n\nPlease excuse my sleepy looking face. This photo was taken after a super long day. I am actually rocking an entire face of BFTE Cosmetics. I love the way the mineral foundation looks on my skin (and lasts) as well as how gorgeous the eyeshadows are. It all holds up really well.\n\nHere is a look that I rocked back during the fall wearing the mineral foundation. It is a little more clear, a little more in focus. I actually really like this photo because you can SEE MY SKIN. It looks like my skin and not a ton of cakey makeup. I think that is perfection", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "ddd2cf03-a8a5-48d1-89ea-a97dfdaee70a", "url": "http://www.mynewestaddiction.com/2015/02/bfte-makeup.html"}

{"text": "Month: May, 2015\n\nYesterday was a awesome day for Window Tinting ! I went to Penske and completed the last of the Commercial Vehicle Window Tinting for them.\nThey had a Chevy Truck for me to apply Truck Window Tinting to. After the truck they had a Chevy Equinox they wanted some Auto Window Tinting applied to as well. Today I spent about six hours removing old purple Window Tint from a older Ford Mustang Cobra. It was nice and hot outside today so it made the older Window Tint come off fairly easy. It is always a guessing game as to how easy or hard the old Window Tint removal can be. I used the black bag and 409 plus soapy water mixture today to assist in creating steam for Tint removal.\nTomorrow I have a older Tran Am to strip and apply new Window Tint on. This tint on this Trans Am looks very thin. Bring on the heat and the black bagging again tomorrow ! Its a Window Tint Resurrection Weekend!\n\nYesterday was a pretty good day for Window Tinting, and today was even better ! Unfortunately yesterday a girl called me looking for an estimate for Window Tinting a back window on her car. I offered her a fair price and she hung up. She called back about five minutes later and when she started to speak ,no kidding, it sounded like she had marbles in her mouth.\nI could not understand a word she was saying. I don't know if she had a lolly pop in her mouth or what. I had to ask her to repeat herself several times. So she hung up again and decided to put a bad review up on my Google Plus page. How nice and understanding of her, NOT. I guess I can't please all of the people all of the time ! I am not a interpreter, I am merely a Window Tint Master. Yesterday was great I had two customers come to take advantage of my free Mobile Window Tinting service . The first Customer dropped his Prius off for Window Tint stripping and replacement. I gave him a ride to his job and after I applied new Window Tint to his car I went back to his place of business and picked him up to bring him back to his car. The second customer brought his Jetta for new CXP top of the line Window Tinting. I took him home and I picked him back up so he did not have to wait around at my place while I tinted his car. Who can beat that kind of Mobile Window Tinting Service ??? I doubt any other Window Tinting company offers that kind of Customer Care. Tomorrow its back to Penske for more Commercial Auto Window Tinting !Today I applied Window Tint to a KIA Sorento. If you look at my pictures your can see how at all cost I avoid cutting Window Tint patterns on your vehicles glass. This eliminates the possibility of scratching your car glass!\n\nYesterday was a great day for Window Tinting . Actually it was a great day for Commercial Window Tint stripping. I went to an office location in Phoenix and I removed old distorted and peeling Commercial Window Tint.\nI knew this job was not going to go easy so I prepared well for this Window Tint stripping endeavor and I brought my Jiffy Steamer.\nAs I first started to try to peel the old Window Tint off of the glass it began to separate into two layers and it started to tare. Most all window films are made in at least two ply ( two layers). With my extensive experience in Window Tinting I know when stripping if the film separates into two layers, the best way to remove the film is to always try to pull both layers of film at the same time ! If you pull the first layer off and try to get the second layer of film is very thin and is usually bonded to the glass and will seem to be impossible to get to release from the glass. That means you better have a big box of razor blades, plenty of time and muscle power. Much easier with my steamer.\nToday I have a customer who was supposed to be here at 8 am to drop his car off for Auto Window Tint stripping and retint. and I was going to give him a ride to and from work. He called and pushed the time back to 10 am. I don't like to be in a rush but it looks like I will be today .\n\nIt was a great Memorial Day Window Tinting today ! Today I used my Mobile Window Tinting service after a customer dropped off their car , I gave them a ride home in my Mobile Service Vehicle. I returned to my place and applied Car Window Tint . They returned to pick up their car. My next customer wanted to wait while I applied Auto Window Tint to his Jeep Wrangler. The back glass on the jeep was once broken on the jeep and when it was replaced, it was replaced with a piece of privacy glass.\nSo the back glass was tinted but the rest of the jeep had no tint, until today! It was a nice easy Window Tinting day today . Tomorrow I will go to a business office building being remodeled and I will strip old Commercial Silver Window Tint. This film should be a challenge to get off of the glass. It has been baked on the glass for over 20 years and is finally starting to deteriorate.\n\nIt was anther great day for Window Tinting today ! I finished the 430 square foot of glass Home Window Tinting in Laveen. Two days of Home Window Tinting . Tomorrow on Memorial Day I will work. I have a vehicle coming here for two front doors Auto Tinting . I have another Coming around three and I have an Infinity coupe coming here at about six. It should be a great day of tinting. Hopefully I can squeeze in some Lawn mowing !\n\nYesterday was a very busy day for Window Tinting ! I had a great day yesterday going and providing my Mobile Window Tinting service to my regular customers at Safeguard Security. That is the fourth Nissan Van I have applied Auto Window Tinting to this week for Safeguard. From what I have heard there will be many more for me to apply Commercial Auto Window Tint to . After the Van Window Tinting I went to the Recreation Centers of Sun City West to do some Commercial Window Tinting on some French Doors. After the mornings application of Commercial Window Tinting I had a customer bring me a car they just bought for their son for Graduation. So I applied some Metal Suntek Window Tint to provide a great amount of heat. Today I started the Home Window Tinting I had scheduled in Laveen. I applied Home Window Tint to 35 Windows in my customers home today . There are 28 More for me to apply Residential Window Tint to tomorrow. We LOVE Home Window Tinting! I hope all of my followers and friends have a safe and Happy Memorial Weekend, as we go on happily Tinting\n\nYesterday was a good day for Window Tinting. I had a customer come to me with his Jeep Cherokee for Auto Window Tinting. This customer wanted the Highest Quality Window Tint I have available so I applied the Suntek Carbon XP Window Tint. This CXP Window Tint made by Suntek is the one of the most optically clear Window Tints available. The CXP is also warranted against color fade or change of color. This CXP also blocks as much heat as the Metal Window Tint and it will not interfere with Sirius Satellite radio signals. Most new cars today have a Satellite receiver \"pod\" or antenna mounted on the top of the car so in this case you can get away with the application of Metal Window Tint without radio satellite signal interference.\nToday I will go Mobile Window Tinting to Enterprise Fleet Management and apply Auto Window Tinting to another Nissan Van for Safeguard Security. After the Auto Window Tinting I will go Mobile Window Tinting to the Recreation Centers of Sun City. They have two french doors the want Commercial Window Tint applied on. After the Commercial Window Tinting I will return to my place and apply Auto Window Tint to a VW Passot. It should be a good day in my world of Window Tint !\n\nToday was a long day for Window Tinting. I spent all day at a customers house applying Auto Window Tint to his Motor Home. This customer wanted the best film available for his RV so I applied Suntek Cxp. I applied Window Tint to the front doors, the Kitchen and Living room area and to the Master Bedroom. Tomorrow I have Jury Duty. Not looking forward to the long dragged out day tomorrow.\n\nIt was another terrific day for Window Tinting ! I used my Mobile Window Tinting service to go to Enterprise Fleet Vehicle Management to apply Auto Window Tint to three Nissan NV 200's for Safeguard Security. I have tinted all of Safeguard Security's Vehicles since 1996 .\nTomorrow I will return to a customer who had his Smart Car tinted by me and I will apply specialty Suntek CXP to his motor home .\nYes we tint it all cars, trucks , motor homes, office and residential window tinting, and we specialize in all of these types of Window Film application !\nFor top quality products and expertise in Window Tinting call us at Stick To It Window Tinting\n\nToday was a great day for Window Tinting ! I had a customer come and drop off his VW SUV for Car Window Tinting. This was a third time return customer. Years ago I tinted a Toyota Corolla , a Toyota Truck and now his VW Tiguan. This was a fairly easy vehicle to tint. It is always a good when the customer brings their vehicle to me, especially when the vehicle has all German Glass. I do not like cutting the window tint patterns on this type of glass. I use a sharpie and a light behind the glass to trace a pattern then I remove the tint from the outside of the vehicle and I cut the pattern on a separate sliding glass door in my shop used for \"Pattern Cutting\". This method of Window Tint cutting ensures not cutting into the soft German glass.\nTomorrow I will go to Enterprise Fleet Management to apply Commercial Vehicle Window Tint for Safeguard Security. They have four Commercial Vans that need Auto Window Tinting. I have applied Commercial Window Tint to all of Safeguard security Commercial Vehicles for over 19 years.", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "b2b68467-068c-4556-b83b-aaf00a313295", "url": "https://sticktoittint1.wordpress.com/2015/05/"}

{"text": "Ten Loves: Church's SS17 Derby Shoe\n\nWell actually, that's a lie. Because we love the whole collection. Obviously. We got a little sneak peek in Milano, where they held a presentation this weekend. But we must say, it was these brand new Church's Derby shoes that first caught our greedy little eyes. Because, unlike our Editrix-in-Chief, we are physically unable to conduct day-to-day business in a 6-inch heel. Occasionally our trotters need a day off. Which thus makes this fine pair of flats the perfect encasing for hiding away our sweaty little feet. Flats that are, or so we are told, made of not one-tone, not two-tone but three-tone brushed calf leather, perfectly fashioned into a wingtip formation, drawing inspo from one of the brand's iconic men's models, the \"Grafton\". Think of this, then, as a femme-d up version. A little slimmer. Sexier, even. Made for the lady who enjoys a sensible shoe with a little pizzaz. And, for those who perhaps wish to wear a different shade on each foot, they come in a selection of different colours – everything from, to lift wholesale from the press release, \"Baltic blue to yellow, from red to pale grey and from pink to sand.\"", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "7d69a56f-0162-4f18-a803-c3a6b97ada88", "url": "http://www.10magazine.com/womenswear/ten-loves-churchs-ss17-derby-shoe/"}
{"text": "Renovating a 92 year old 20,000 square foot former Freemason Temple into a home\n\nWhite Christmas!\n\nMerry Christmas friends!! I hadn't planned on making another post so soon but our wishes for a white Christmas came true in a big way! We were hit with a decent sized snowstorm yesterday and while I was also hit with a decent sized respiratory virus (thanks Atom for sharing your man flu), I wasn't going to let that stop me from enjoying every minute of this winter wonderland. This storm made the last one look like nothing! We were expecting 3-6 inches of snow.\n\nAfter the morning Christmas Eve service at church we went home and changed into our show gear and drove a few blocks to our favorite little park (normally we walk or ride our bikes but definitely not in this weather. It was snowing pretty hard). We had so much fun sledding down some small hills we found and just jumping around in the snow and being silly. (Next time we were told to hit up Memorial Park for the big sledding hills!) It was so peaceful. We were the only people out at the park. No one else was around. I think I told Atom I just couldn't get over how GORGEOUS this all was. I was so giddy!\n\nWhen we got back home the plows had been out and our streets had been plowed, making them safer to drive on thankfully. By the late afternoon the sidewalk was completely covered and rising. The snow didn't stop all day! I jumped on the house renovation Facebook page & filmed a super quick live video in the snow. There is a link to the Facebook page on the blog site if you haven't seen it.\n\nThese next 2 photos were taken at 3pm yesterday afternoon. The parking lot at this point was already completely covered and if you look to the right you can see that the concrete parking blocks were almost covered with snow.\n\nThis morning we got up and we were all delighted to see we had gotten even more snow overnight and our parking lot was mid-calf deep with snow. After our children opened their gifts and we had our home made orange cinnamon rolls we couldn't get back into our snow gear fast enough & barreled out the front door. It was quite a bit colder than yesterday with the wind but we had a ton of layers on & with the building blocking out a good portion of the wind we were good.\n\nThe morning started out pretty windy and gloomy and my cat mask came in quite handy.\n\nThen a short while later it was all sunny skies and absolutely gorgeous. Still pretty darn cold but we didn't care, we were having an absolute blast making snowballs and snow angels and jumping through the parking lot snow.\n\nAlso, we built this pretty awesome snow mound.\n\nHope you've all had a wonderful holiday! I'll be making another post later this week with a finished side project and then it's back to major renovations & getting the kitchen done! YAY!\n\nTheresa\n\nShare this:\n\nLike this:\n\nPost navigation\n\n2 thoughts on \"White Christmas!\"\n\nCongratulations on your first big snow! Being from Michigan I know snow. There is nothing like the silence and stillness of a big snow falling. It is beautiful and white and perfect. For a minute. Then you realize you have to shovel and snow blow it and you are begging Mother Nature to just. Make. It. Stop. Now. The beautiful white snow turns into a grey slushy dirty thing. But, enjoy it for now and may your kids enjoy the feeling of a snow day. As a nurse, and I know you are a respiratory therapist, unfortunately we have no snow days in a hospital, and if I got snowed in for a few days, the hospital sent Civil Defense and the local National Guard to pick us up and take us to work.", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "c45a0b9c-4a84-487d-bbfc-a6e50e50da80", "url": "https://freemasontomansion.wordpress.com/2017/12/25/white-christmas/"}

{"text": "Glenn Alexander Hosts Cancer Benefit Pig Gig 2019\n\nIf April showers bring May flowers we ought to have a ton. I know I showered at least once in April but I can't say I smell like a flower. Okay folks – Pig Gig Arkansas is happening May 19th. Make the trip if you can or feel free to donate any amount to Fibrolamellar Cancer Foundation (FCF) in honor of Jay Alexander. We're doing all we can to raise money and save lives and share some love, food, music and laughter while doing it. The only Shadowland hit in months – and for a bit – is May 24th. Come party with us at our favorite roadhouse joint, Roxy & Dukes. Enjoy the sunshine, the energy of spring and be safe. We hope to see you in May.\n\nWell, Pig Gig Arkansas is Sunday, May 19th and I can't begin to tell you how excited I am about it!!! This is a very special event for my family, because it honors my late nephew, Jay Alexander and raises money for a very good cause. We lost Jay in November of 2011 to a rare disease that strikes young people in the prime of their lives – Fibrolamellar Cancer. Jay was only 20 when he died, but we have been having Pig Gigs to raise money for research so other families don't have to lose their loved ones like we lost Jay. Pig Gig Arkansas is being held in Rogers, Arkansas – Jay's hometown – and will feature a pig roast, lots of other food and desserts, plus some really awesome entertainment, including local musical acts Eric Miller and popular duo Lazy Daisy. Also appearing -GLENN ALEXANDER & SHADOWLAND!!! That's right, we're packin' up and headin' to Arkansas to rock the Pig Gig!!! It's gonna be a great day, so please keep checkin' all the usual spots for info –my website/Facebook/Twitter. Tickets are available here. If you can't make it and want to make a difference, please donate directly to the Fibrolamellar Cancer Foundationin memory of my nephew, Jay Alexander. And remember, the annual Pig Gig New Jersey will be comin' up in the Fall, so keep watchin' for details. Here's To Jay!!! ……..\n\nTHE JUKES: Whew! Finally back home for a bit after an incredible run of shows that went from mid-February to mid April. We went down south, up north, to the Midwest and to the U.K. It was crazy, but fun -the band was welcomed with open arms wherever we went and it was great to see new and old friends. I love travelin' with the band, however, there's nothing like comin' home and regrouping for a bit. We travel to New England this month, as well as Philadelphia. Plus, we're back at New York's City Winery, after a couple of sold-out shows in late March, so we're excited to get back there. Hope to see some of y'all along the way……..\n\nSHADOWLAND: With The Jukes extensive touring schedule, it's been very hard to schedule Shadowland dates, but we're back this month at one of our favorite places to play – Roxy & Duke's Roadhouse in Dunellen! We'll be there Friday, May 25th, so start off your long, Memorial Day weekend with an evening of kick-ass music from Shadowland!!! … Just a quick update on the new Shadowland recording -it's comin'! Once again, The Jukes touring schedule has caused a delay in the new release, but we're workin' hard behind the scenes to get new music out ASAP, so please stay tuned……..\n\nETC: Oria and I will be back at two of our favorite joints in May – Barnacle Bill's and Salt Creek Grille. Our good friend, Chris Plunkett will join us on bass on both dates. We always have a great time on these gigs – they're very loose and relaxed – and we are so in sync, musically speaking, that it is always a great night.

Because how you end the night is the ultimate manifestation of stylish drinking.\"\n\nFor those that haven't yet had the pleasure, Haig Club is a single grain scotch whisky with a 'character and style that sets it apart.' Part of the Scottish Haig whisky family, it aims to put a youthful spin on the whisky market which is traditionally known as more of an 'old boys club'. The drink boasts an iconic blue bottle and an urban feel; two qualities which the brand were keen to emulate in their latest digital campaign.\n\nLocate Productions worked closely with creative agency, MullenLowe and photographer, Liam Goslett to capture the candid stills. The brief for the campaign centered on the importance of responsible drinking, and required lively London streets popular with young people on a night out.\n\nUtilising the experience and the know how of our location scouts, we found the perfect setting in three different spots – Shoreditch, Hoxton and Soho. Heavily involved with the casting as well as the locations, we took to the streets to cast talent, with extra models cast through an agency as back up.\n\nDespite the driving rain that fell on both nights, we were able to find willing 'real people' to stand in as models, and to create something special that fit the brief. We're proud to have been a part of this project, and had a lot of fun working on it!", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "a7500932-17e9-45d9-b44c-81f3220d37fe", "url": "https://www.locateproductions.com/leaveasyouarrived-with-haig-club/"}

Make sure if you live in higher altitudes(above 3500 ft) that you add 1-2 tbs cornstarch into mix so it won't collapse.\nI just found this recipe, made it today, it is cooling right now, can't wait for my husband to get home from work and try it. I made this cake a few weeks ago and while it was delicious, when I tried turning it upside down right out of the oven the whole thing fell apart. After watching Craftsy's Online Cake Decorating Class, Jessica Harris' Clean and Simple Cake Design, I was inspired to create a patterned cake and try out her methods.\n\nJessica also shares how she prepares her cakes to get that really smooth fondant with razor sharp edges.

IF YOU HAVE GREASE ON ANY OF YOUR ITEMS IT CAN MESS UP THE WAY THE EGG WHITES REACT AND MAKE IT GO \"FLAT\"!\nI read alot of the comments, I hope mine turns out, as my family loves angel food cake and I want to make another one using the cherry pie filling.\nIt is delicious and soooo easy THe only thing I did different was make the cake batter as stated, put it in a pan, and dumped the pineapple with juice right in making sure it was evenly spread out. Take your pineapple put it in your pan with the juices take your dry yellow cake mix put on top then take your stick butter cut it up and cover your cake mix up then pop it in to the oven until cake is done.\n\nMake sure to use an ungreased baking dish and cook long enough until it's getting a little toasty around the edges. I have added crushed graham cracker crumbs over the cake mix (yellow or chocolate) never tried angel food mix. I will give it another try with just baking it slower, and mixing it more for a better consistancy. In large mixing bowl, mix powdered Angel Food Cake Mix and Crushed Pineapple together {including the juice from the can} - dona€™t add any other ingredients.\nI decorated the whole cake with whipped cream then sprinkled chopped pineapple and chopped maraschino cherries over the top and alternated pineapple chunks and whole maraschino cherries around the bottom of the cake.", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "23fa03dc-0aa1-4eac-a3e9-7bd385b99f6b", "url": "http://s3.amazonaws.com/cookingspent/angel-food-cake-recipe-with-strawberries.html"}

Having a great wedding limo service is a blessing because that is one stress ingredient off your mind.\n\nTrack Record\n\nThe service provider must have not only ample experience in transporting brides and bridegrooms, but also an impeccable track record in safety, security, punctuality and comfort.\n\nThe occasion is extraordinarily special and demands the highest quality service in terms of the majesty and elegance of the vehicle, the culture, grace, and discretion of the chauffeur.\n\nPricing\n\nA wedding day is made up of hundreds of dynamic events that must be integrated to make one whole.\n\nGround transportation is just one of these cogs in the wedding day wheel. Of course, you would not want to be tight-fisted when making the arrangements for your wedding day but that is not the same as an unwarranted splurge.\n\nLook for a service provider who offers a short duration package with additional hours tagged on if demanded. Generally, a wedding limo service with a three hours package should be adequate to drive the bride and the bridegroom independently to the wedding ceremony and, thereafter, to the wedding reception.\n\nAlternatively, you could look for a customized package - 2 hours at the commencement and 2 hours on the conclusion of the celebrations.\n\nComforts\n\nThe limousine will be steered by a chauffeur dressed in a tuxedo and a chauffeur's hat with a crown and a gleaming visor, and the car will be equipped with bottled water, exquisite champagne, ice cubes, delicate flute glasses and designer folded napkins.\n\nThe bridal couple will enjoy the personal but unobtrusive attention of the chauffeur and their every wish will be his command.\n\nFleet\n\nThe professional service provider will have a wide choice of limousines - Cadillac Escalade, Lincoln Navigator, Lincoln Town Car, Yukon GMC and models of Porsche, Audi, Mercedes-Benz, etc.\n\nCoordinate with the wedding planner to determine the maximum number of people that would have to be ferried in the car for wedding party travel to the photography studio for family photographs, to the reception venue, etc. and hire a limousine with adequate capacity, or perhaps two limousines, one for the bridal couple and another for the immediate family.\n\nSpecial Guests\n\nThere are guests, there are special guests and then there are very special guests. You would not want the last category to stand in line for a town taxi.\n\nThe best solution is to arrange for a pick up from the airport by an airport limo service. You could make the reservation on the phone or on the service provider's website or through a mobile app. Some of them encourage interaction through WhatsApp to make things simpler like the latest craze of Dubai, Jugaad.ae.\n\nMake sure that you share the flight details of your very special guest with the ground transportation provider, who will track the flight arrival and tweak the pick-up time at the gate to ensure that you do not incur more expenses on waiting time fees than what is essential. You could even choose to have your guest picked up at the curbside outside the airport terminal, though you may prefer to instruct a meet-and-greet service in the baggage claim area (for an additional fee).\n\nPersonalised care is the hallmark of excellence in service, and never more so than in providing wedding limo service because these are memories that last forever and you want the service to be remembered for all the right reasons.\n\nJugaad gives Limo benefits the most agreeable and professional airport limo Services in Dubia.

{"text": "Unleash Your Inner Monkey\n\nFirst Friday' Category\n\nTragically Hip, The Band, The Eagles, Simon & Garfunkel were just a few of the groups whose hit songs local band The Drift covered during the April 4, 2014 First Friday at Cheeky Monkey.\nThe Drift is a 3 piece band consisting of Wes Beveridge (Guitar Vocals), Ron Webber (Bass, Guitar, Vocals) and Paul Eastman (percussion). All the members are seasoned musicians with a long musical lineage in the area that are not only good performers, but also have a knack for knowing what songs please a crowd. That was evident by the number of people bobbing their heads in time or dancing along.\nWe are proud to say, this was the debut of The Drift and we know we will be hearing about them often playing other venues in the near future.\nOn the walls of Cheeky Monkey, the eclectic artwork of Martha Finch is on exhibit and for sale. For a well ...\n\nA fun evening of favourite songs to sing along to was provided by Danielle on keyboard, Joanne on guitar and Janet on lead vocals. The trio are known as DJ2 (that's pronounced 'DJ squared). Ranging from Anne Murray to Perry Como, they covered all the bases of hits from a by-gone era. The audience enjoyed their enthusiasum and talent as did we. These are not only three musically talented ladies, but they are also great humanitarians volunteering much of their time and energy to put smiles on the faces of those unable to get out to events like First Friday. We are pleased they found time to spend with us and we look forward to them coming back again in the future.\nTo view more photos for this evening, CLICK HERE\n\nWOW! I'll say it again - WOW! We along with a roomful of fans were all blown away by the talent in the band VIRGINIA PLAIN. This 5 piece band really has their act together with a tight and comfortable sound that usually comes from years of playing together. Hard to believe they have only been Virginia Plain for a bit over a year with very few live shows under their belt.\nTheir playlist of originals mixed with cover tunes had a fresh, contemporary groove. Lead singing duties were shared by Matt Naylor, Zach McLaughlin, and Al Symeonakis with each picking the perfect songs for their vocal abilities. Rounding out the band contributing to what Roland calls \"a full band sound\" are Dennis Graham on keyboard and Adam Bettridge on drums.\nVirginia Plain's take on a LCD Soundsystem's 'You Want A Hit' and Pink Floyd's 'Comfortably Numb' where huge crowd pleasers. I thought their ...\n\nWe would like to thank all the customers and music fans that braved the cold weather to join us at the first First Friday of 2014.\nThose that were here, felt if was well worth coming into Cheeky Monkey to hear the local band of ELEMENT OF SURPRISE PROJECT play and view the photographic artwork of CHRISTINE ROENSPIESS.\nThe band played two hours of crowd pleasing classic hit songs. Starting off with Neil Young's 'Cinnamon Girl', we all knew we were in for a good night. ESP's versions of Steppenwolf's 'Born To Be Wild\" and Jeff Beck's 'Freeway Jam' really caught my ears too.\nDarren Diamond on lead guitar and vocals (he's our mechanic from Best Automotive - talented in many ways apparently), Neil Whittle on guitar and vocals (formerly played here for the Streets reunion), Graham Dalley on bass and keyboards and Gerry Ostrihon on drums (played here last July with Cross ...\n\nOhhh the weather outside was frightful - but the music inside was delightful - it didn't show signs of stopped - so let it snow let it snow let it snow. Sing along!\nThe temperature outside didn't matter. Inside Cheeky Monkey it was warm and cozy thanks in part to the music of Mike Blackmore and his drummer Chris Hutton. To carry the warm theme further, the underwater photographs by Christine Roenspiess provided a very tropical feel.\nMike is always entertaining, despite his regular group of fellow muscians not being along with him. Instead he had a 'guest drummer' in his long time friend Chris Hutton who has recently moved back to Sarnia. This being Chris' first experience in the revitalized downtown, he express his joy at being part of the evenings fun.\nMike playing acoustic guitar and sometime d'jembe, gave his original songs new twisted we hadn't heard before. I particularly enjoyed a ...\n\nThe walls of Cheeky Monkey are currently adorned with the Sarnia Photographic Club's interpretations of song or album titles. It is interesting to see how some took titles very literally such as \"Sand in the Vaseline\" by the Talking Heads, while others are much more abstract such as the photo depicting The Rolling Stones song \"Paint it Black\". From comical to serious they are all worth a good look. The exhibit will continue until November 29th. When you stop in be sure to cast your vote for The People's Choice Award.\nDuring the evening of the November 1st First Friday, the local band Paula & The Cornhuskers entertained the crowd with a few cover songs, but mostly originals done in a rocking country blues style. Paula Loxton is the main lead singer and song writer getting inspiration from as diverse of topics as her Grandma as a young woman in the ...\n\nThe October 4th First Friday was a flurry of activity at Cheeky Monkey.\nOutside the store a volunteer from the Canadian Cancer Society was selling pink ribbons for their PINK RIBBON DAYS which raises money for breast cancer research. Not sure how they did with the sale, but judging by the number of people sport the ribbons on their clothes, I'd guess they did alright. There were 2 different volunteers I had the honour of meeting. I made a point of thanking them for their time and efforts. Without these tireless volunteers, funds would be much harder to come by. For anyone who has been touched in their lives by cancer of any kind, you know how important it is for us all to do our part towards finding a cure.\nAlso outside were 2 actors in 1913 costumes from the upcoming play 'The Great Storm\" to be performed at the Sarnia ...\n\nYou may not recognize the name of the band that played in Cheeky Monkey for the September First Friday, but you will start hearing it much more often. Brock Street Ends is a recent combination of musicians from former bands Portrait of You and Natural Disasters. Both are bands that have played at Cheeky Monkey previously to the delight of us and the audience. All four members, Barry White (bass/vocals), Dale Mellon (keyboards/vocals), Don LeBlanc (guitar) and Paul Eastman (drums) have a true love of music that is evident when you see them perform so it is no surprise they did not waste any time forming a new group.\nThe large crowd that was here to enjoy their playing appreciated their extensive set list. Some of the covers they performed were Beatles 'Back in the USSR', Eagles 'Life In the Fast Lane', Cars 'Just What I Needed', White Stripes 'Seven Nation ...\n\nI have lost count on how many times Kesenia Parent has played at Cheeky Monkey. She has been here for Saturday afternoon gigs, outside and inside as well as several First Fridays, including the August 2012 exactly a year ago.\nWhat has always struck me about Kesenia is her ease in front of an audience. She is very good at developing a connection by telling a few jokes, stories and explaining where the inspiration for her original songs come from. Add this to the fact she has a very good voice and can play her acoustic guitar well and you have an all round entertaining performance.\nShe is able to play and make her own a long list of cover songs such as The Beatles 'Let It Be' , OneRepublic 'Apologize' and Leonard Cohen's 'Hallelujah'. Her self penned songs of the past have been cute little diddies filled with humour, but her ...\n\nFirst Friday participants who stopped into Cheeky Monkey quickly realized that Cross Tie Walker were just as hot and steamy as the weather outside on this July 5th evening. One customer said he was drawn into our store by the vibrating sidewalk. Yup they were rattling the windows & walls right out onto the sidewalk under people's feet!\nThe four piece dynamic band playing covers of familiar rock 'n' roll classics from the likes of Creedence Clearwater Revival, Deep Purple and Jimi Hendrix held nothing back. a personal stand out for me was a rendition of a Stevie Ray Vaughan song. To be honest, I don't remember the songs name. I just know it was so awesome I did NOT want it to stop. These guys really put everything they've got into their singing playing.\nRecently formed as Cross Tie Walker, they are all seasoned musicians coming from several well known and ...", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "2eb9a045-be6a-4db4-b7e5-7b2cf100eaed", "url": "http://cheekymonkeysarnia.ca/category/first-friday/page/8/"}

Thank you for everything. 5 stars.\n\nJob No. 29913916 - Pre-construction Phase Review\n\npublished 4 days ago\n\n- Awesome service by the Sales Consultant [name removed] - engaging, informed, proactive. Before we put down a deposit on purchasing our land, at short notice [name removed] conducted the necessary checks to see our preferred home layout would fit on the land without any issues. His quick investigation meant we were quickly able to secure our land, knowing the home layout would fit. Very responsive and always had time for us, even when we dropped in or rang unannounced (including when he was on leave). Gave us great insights into the build proc...Read more\n\ness and great, frank advice on potential risks and decisions. Kept us fully informed of key developments. His initial estimate came to within $50 of the tender price!\n- Equally tremendous experience with [name removed] our Tender and Contract Presenter. Documentation was sent in advance of these meetings as promised, enabling us to thoroughly review these and come prepared to the Tender and Contract appointments, respectively. [name removed] was patient in comprehensively explaining all of the documentation, highlighting key points, including answering queries from our own review prior to the appointments. There were some minor discrepancies in the documentation which were all addressed and sentenced at the appointments by [name removed], including drawing up and signing off the necessary paperwork. Email communications with [name removed] were prompt and effectively answered our queries. Due to our preference to get as much of the pre-construction activity completed before the Christmas break, [name removed] also went out of her way to organise Contract and Colours appointments as quickly as possible. At the appointments, we were made to feel very comfortable even offering us complimentary beverages / smoothies, as we had not had lunch and come straight from work.\n- So far so good, Colours is due very soon before Christmas, as requested. Our CSC has introduced herself to us and we look forward to the continued great experience with Clarendon with the next steps and beyond into construction!\n\nGreat journey with Clarendon so far......\n\npublished 4 days ago\n\nMy house construction got started about a month ago, and the journey so far has been pretty amazing. [name removed] has been our Customer Service Consultant and she has been quite helpful and attentive whenever we needed help or had questions. Building is also going on nicely and hopefully the same quality will be exhibited throughout the build. Fingers crossed! I would happily recommend Clarendon to anyone based on our experience so far.\n\nGlenelg 27 MKII\n\npublished 4 days ago\n\nMy partner and I are a young couple building our first home. We first bought our block two years ago - it was a shallow but wide block compared to the newer narrow but deep lots of land. We also had a substation on a neighbouring block that had a zone of influence onto our lot. At first, we went to homeworld centres at Kellyville, Marsden Park and Oran Park. Besides a small few, most builders said they had nothing to offer us and even asked us why we bought it! It made us question whether a house was a good idea - seeing builders throw the land...Read more\n\nwe were proud of back in our face, especially as customers willing to spend $300K+. Having already made a $400k+ investment in our future, it honestly left us feeling exhausted and down. Thats when we visited Clarendon Homes Supercentre and met [name removed]. He was able to find a house that could fit our block and our needs too! Was very honest and straight forward. Was quick to answer our questions and concerns. This started our journey with Clarendon and it has been amazing ever since. Tender and colour selection was easy, awesome selection of inclusions too. We are currently mid-construction and everything is moving quickly. We havent had any major issues thus far. Site manager is awesome, weekly updates and answers all our question. Very easy to get into contact with. Very obliging too, taking into account our timeline to hopefully have the home ready for us. Could not have asked for anyone better!!\n\nAmazing supervisor\n\npublished 4 days ago\n\n[name removed] has been our site supervisor, and thus far we are very impressed. He has remained in constant contact, as well as striving for perfection in our home build. He is more than happy to take our feedback on board, and has spent time educating us about the build process as well.\n\nExcellent\n\npublished 4 days ago\n\n[name removed] was very helpful and quite understanding with the constant maintenance issues i had after construction. Anytime something needed attention it would be fixed. The best guy I've had to deal with through clarendon. If [name removed] was at the front of the building process the journey would not be difficult at all.\n\n5 Star Site Manager made our dream home!\n\npublished 4 days ago\n\nBuilding with Clarendon has never been any easier. Being a first home buyer, we were lost and confused. Our sales consultant [name removed] at Rochedale gallery was a gem. Despite 100 repeated question, he was patient to go through line by line with us. He walked with us numerous time to a display home to help us visualize how to build a dream home.\n\nThe next phase of selecting your colour, material etc for built made a difficult task seamless. Thanks to [name removed] for being a great consultant, helping with suggestion and ensuring we stayed...Read more\n\non track. Always willing to listen and provide us with a wide range of ideas.\nToday this beautiful 5 bedroom house built on a prime estate could not be possible without the help of [name removed], our site supervisor. From addressing issues to always being available despite having a very tight schedule and accommodating to our hours, he went far and beyond his duties to ensure the house was built to perfection. Products that were faulty, he did not compromise on quality. He ensured it was addressed and rectified immediately and always willing to give a helping hand. Small defects such as paint chip, he ensured its repainted and looked seamless.\nLike a little child at a lolly shop, as proud owners; we were always excited to receive his weekly Friday progress build email. It had great snaps of the home, updates and progress. This helped us tremendously to plan better for our move.\n[name removed] deserve the award of site-supervisor of the year. He is passionate, always has a listening ear, patient and importantly provided five-star customer service.\nClarendon is a builder that does not focus on getting your sales, but they walk the talk of after-sales customer service. While we pulled a few items out of the contract (garage and landscaping), they still attended to our calls on termite mesh with our external provider not once but twice on-site. They ensured it was attended immediately and worked closely with our external provider.\n\nExcellent Building experience\n\npublished 4 days ago\n\nWe had great building experience with Clarendon. It started from initial planning (including lots of structural variations: which Clarendon accommodated and priced reasonably). Later on, Staff at colour and electrical selection meeting were really cooperative. Our site manager and building consultant were very cooperative. They adjusted our few demands up till last month. Our site manager kept us involved, available, made sure that every concern raised by us was addressed and made our experience really pleasant. Now its six months since we have moved in our new home and we absolutely love it. Build quality is excellent and we cannot fault any thing. If i am building home again, i will definitely look towards Clarendon first.\n\nAmazing builders!\n\npublished 4 days ago\n\nHaving dealt with many builders in a contract context it is clear that Clarendon Homes are an organised and quality focused builder. All contract interactions have been extremely professional and Clarendon have proven to be true to their word and have always focused on putting the client first with a high emphasis on quality! Im excited to be able to build a new home, and without a doubt I will be heading straight to Clarendon homes.\n\nQuestions & Answers\n\nI am wondering if any customer building a house with Clarendon have to pay the LowE windows due to Basix certification requirements. We have been asked to pay some extra for LowE windows after getting the Basix certification.\n\n4 answers\n\nWe are in Qld , comparing with Metricon after all upgrades , 20k diff in quotes and even getting bigger aircon and solar with Metricon ,\n\nLike\n\nReport\n\nCustomer Care T.Clarendon Homes1 month ago\n\nHi Parm, Clarendon are one of the better value builders in the market place. Clarendon also offer a competitor deposit refund of up to $1,000. So you can always have Clarendon and Metricon quote (see if Metricon will offer this refund also).\n\nThe only price that matters is the end price, once soil test and site surveys are complete and colours are done. This price is prepared by the office. Be careful relying solely on a sales persons quote.\n\nOne disappointing job. I have already contacted Clarendon regarding my broken roof tiles a job done by Boral roofing. I provided evidence of the broken tiles and there is evidence of some tiles which had silicon applied to fix the breaks during contraction time. The person who came to assess the roof then alleged that it could be hail storm which damaged the tiles. Not true or being hypothetical by specifying a date after handover. There is no single house which had hail damage at any time in our new estate. My house took 13 months to complete (that's another story for another day) and they actually refused to compensate me enough sighting 60 rain days on their log. Now they want me to make a false report to my insurance and for me to claim while paying the excess amount of a new roof I paid for while the tiler used substandard tiles and broken ones using silicon to join them. A hail claim which I never witnessed. I have the photos and have kept those tiles (attached with silicon) as evidence. I had to buy 30 new tiles and paid someone to repair them after only 8 months living in my house. They never left a single tile at handover, yet the report sent to me has a picture and ticked that they left some (not true). To me its about principle and expecting a professional response not an effort to avoid responsibility. I expected Clarendon to send their own people to see and access, instead they sent the very people who did the substandard job to assess themselves. Now just wanted to find out whether I should approach Fair Trading or Clarendon will take responsibility.\n\nProductReview.com.au has affiliate partnerships.

My thinking was, perhaps you have two LDAP profiles defined, and then the module you are using supports two, so perhaps it is trying to figure out which profile to use, but you have overlapping profiles.\n\nRe: User Activation -Search Returns Multiple Matches Incorre\n\njoakim_ganse;2434612 wrote: Even if that's the case I would define that as a bug.

LDAP Profiles should not overlap. So if this is the case you would want to change your config so its not possible that a user is \"seen\" in multiple LDAP profiles.\n\nIn any case, you might try enabling the 'LDAP Wire Trace' feature. This causes more details about the LDAP data in/out to be logged and might show you the DN of the 2 results returned in your search", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "daf6da8d-ec65-4f72-b334-a1e417817857", "url": "https://community.microfocus.com/t5/SSPR-User-Discussions/User-Activation-Search-Returns-Multiple-Matches-Incorrectly/td-p/2641519"}

{"text": "Having been a long-time fan of the Alex Cross series, I was eager to open up my copy of CROSS. A lot of what I love about the series and Patterson's writing were inside the pages of this book: short chapters, straight-to-the-point dialogue, a fast-moving plot. The only problem is that the plot, in general, left me wanting to yell at someone.\n\nI can overlook the fact that Alex Cross's wife apparently didn't die the way he had originally stated. I can even overlook the fact that after fourteen years and several other relationships (one that even ended in producing a son), Alex now seems obsessed with \"getting over\" his long-dead wife.\n\nWhat I couldn't overlook was the fact that with this book, besides being a detailed description of his wife's murder and Alex's new committment to finding her killer, there's not a whole lot else there. The Alex in this book is moody, melancholy, and totally anti-Alex Cross to the point that I wasn't even sure, halfway through the book, that I was reading about the same character.\n\nHe's not the only one, though. His children, his friends, and even dear old Nana Mama are all acting out of character--and not in good ways.\n\nSure, the \"mystery and suspense\" part of the story is a pretty good one. Patteron's writing style is always a welcome change to me.\n\nAlex Cross was a rising star of the Washington, DC, police department when an unknown shooter gunned down his wife, Maria, in front of him. Alex's need for vengence was placed on hold as he faced another huge challenge -- raising his children without their mother.\n\nThis is one of the best Alex Cross books! Couldn't put it down; wanted to keep reading until finished.\n\nThis was a easy, good read; however, it was not as great as I expected from James Patterson. James Patterson is one of my favorite authors and I will read all of his next books, this one just left me thinking that something else needed to happen.\n\nI wish I'd Crossed this one off my list of reads. I love James Patteson but I was so disappointed in this book. I know alot of folks think it was a fantastic read, I unfortunatly was not one of them. However, you must draw your own conclusion and order this book from me :)\n\nOne of the better books in the Alex Cross series. This book feels more personal, and it is a little less scattered than Patterson's other books. This book felt more whole and complete, compared with many of Patterson's books. It's definitely a fun read.\n\nIt's summer and my favorite pastime is sitting on my screened-in porch on a warm afternoon, reading. I started this one this morning and read it in one sitting. Wow! Cross has drama, action, and best of all, a nice insight into several characters' minds. I loved it!!\n\nI enjoyed the book very much. It was the only one I was missing from the series, and now I have been able to finish reading the series. James Patterson is a wonderful author. I encourage anyone who has not read this series to do so.\n\nAnother Patterson great book featuring Alex Cross. This is the latest book in which Alex faces the deadliest psychopath of them all ... his wife's killer....This is the 12th book of the Alex Cross series...............\n\nPatterson may not be a fancy writer, but he's great when it comes to telling a story. This one is interesting and exciting without getting ridiculous and unbelievable when it comes to side-stories involving someone's personal life.\nGranted, Alex does have some drama with Nana though, because she hates that he puts himself in danger due to his job. Truthfully, her character has irritated me more often than not because of this. I highly doubt she would tell another person in the same job to not come to her rescue if he had a family at home. (Sadly, if her character ever does leave the series, I don't think I'd miss her.)\n\nIn this one we find out about the man believed to be responsible for killing Cross's late wife. It's definitely a page-turner and a fast read because it's hard to put down (plus it has really short chapters and average-sized print.)\n\nFrom Publishers Weekly\nForensic psychologist Alex Cross's storied career in private practice, with the FBI and as a Washington, D.C., cop has brought him into contact with all kinds of seriously disturbed killers, but his 12th outing from bestseller Patterson (after 2005's Mary, Mary) may be the ultimate in lunatic deadliness. Beginning with a flashback to the murder of Cross's wife, Maria, Patterson quickly introduces Michael Sullivan (aka the Butcher of Sligo). What follows is a frenetically paced series of brutal rapes and killings by Sullivan, once employed by the mob as a freelancer and now at war with them. Cross juggles being a single parent and being involved in the dangerous game of tracking serial killers until he finally decides to give it up for his family. Needless to say, he's drawn back into the game when it promises a chance of finding Maria's killer. Cross's competence and vulnerability make a stark contrast with Sullivan's sadistic mutilations and psychological manipulations of his victims. Fans know that Cross will survive, but at what cost?", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "acc9cdee-4385-4bda-a505-60c4bc58944e", "url": "https://www.paperbackswap.com/Cross-Alex-Bk-James-Patterson/review/0316159794/"}
{"text": "An unpretentious thought or two on wine tasting\n\n2016 6th Sense Syrah, Michael David Winery\n\nAll things Michael David turn my head. That goes for their Petite Petit (which I've been drinking since the '11 vintage) and Freakshow (yes the red and Cab) in particular, and even my favorite cellar defender–the market-leading 7 Deadly Zins. With that in mind, it should come as no surprise that the 6th Sense makes an appearance on Notes.\n\n2016 6th Sense Syrah, Michael David Winery, Lodi, California, USA.\n\nIt's an affordable Syrah bottle, capturing grapes sourced from the Phillips family vineyard that is just a stone's throw from the Michael David winery. The wine is aged 14 months in French oak, and the '16 vintage was originally bottled in December of 2017. It has not had that long to set up but makes a good impact on your evening. You get the usual red berry richness of a Michael David, that fruit-forward 'pow', as well as the spicy underpinnings and earthiness that you're seeking in a Syrah. I've sampled probably 50 or more (some 40+ are currently posted here on Notes) Syrahs since starting on this vino adventure, and this holds up pretty well to bottles with heavier price tags. Like other Michael David wines, it does forgo nuance for a sledgehammer of fruit flavor, but at this price tag you'll appreciate it.\n\nTasting notes from the winery claim, \"…the 2016 Syrah shows stunning depth and balance in its youth and will continue to evolve in comings years.\" And I'm sure that, while sort of general wine-speak, it's an accurate call. Most people will opt to uncork and go right at the 6th Sense (as I did) rather than store it but an interesting thought nevertheless. I had my bottle with a well-appointed garden salad (inclusive of mushroom, yellow onion, green olive, and fresh ground black pepper) and chicken breasts and it was an easy sipping wine. I'll surely do it again and am interested in your thoughts, fans, as always.", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "ac82e739-7f73-4cff-9835-371ff003e576", "url": "https://notesofnote.us/2019/02/01/2016-6th-sense-syrah-michael-david-winery/?shared=email&msg=fail"}

With a portion of each sale going to the cause, the total amount raised to date is $17,392.50.

{"text": "Service fees and our extenuating circumstances policy\n\nWe understand there may be some confusion on what happens to service fees for bookings that are cancelled under our extenuating circumstances policy. We want to clarify that Airbnb is refunding all service fees to hosts and guests original payment method for these cancellations.\n\nAirbnb won't benefit from any reservations canceled under this policy. We're truly in this together.\n\nIt's a difficult time right now - and during times of uncertainty, it is important that we find ways to connect and support each other. Sometimes the little things can go a long way, so please share any tips and supportive words you have for one another.\n\nIn the meantime, please refer to our Resource Center and our Help Centerto find the latest information on our COVID-19 response, from policy updates to resources for hosts and guests.\n\nRe: Service fees and our extenuating circumstances policy\n\n\"In this together\"? Are you in complete denial of what this is doing to hosts? I refuse to believe that Airbnb doesn't know how basic business principles work. Shame on you AIRBNB for doing what you're doing to hosts right now. I e already lost $7k in the past day due to your new bs policy that helps no one but guests and Airbnb come out on top. Shows you're actually \"in this together\" and pay guests back for enacting a policy that is causing mass cancellations where only guests benefit. We are all livid and looking at how we can exit your platform to other ones that actually value us aka your inventory! this is going to take monetary sacrifice from Airbnb toward hosts to make this right or we're all going to leave.\n\nRe: Service fees and our extenuating circumstances policy\n\nWe've been thrown under the bus. I lost $1400.00 today. Airbnb is my only source of income. With $100.00 in the bank, where am I going?Complete lack of concern for hosts. This is unacceptable. Community? What a joke. I'm in serious trouble now. We demand help and respect. If Airbnb thinks this is a good PR move for their already tarnished reputation well they've just added more fuel to the fire unless we're compensated. Did a 50% refund for guests and a 50% payout for hosts not cross they're minds. That's fair. Clearly fairness is not on Airbnbs mind. Disgrace.\n\nRe: Service fees and our extenuating circumstances policy\n\nWell put. All the time we put into all of this and the guest has the opportunity to cancel but waits until the day before check in to rob us of any potential to re book our home. That is unprofessional and sinful\n\nRe: Service fees and our extenuating circumstances policy\n\ni love how they're being generous by \"Refunding all service fees\". What would have been the alternative??? Cancel all our guests reservations, give back 100%, absolutely nothing to the host, AND charge us a service fee?! Where do I send my \"thank you\" letter? Do you not realize we have mortgage payments (and utilities, and property taxes) AirBNB? Our \"strict\" policy WAS our safety net. It's the way we try to make sure we at least make something to cover expenses. Something is better than nothing. This takes away our safety net and that why you've lost our trust.\n\nRe: Service fees and our extenuating circumstances policy\n\nwe're going to have to go into debt and sell the house if this carries on !\n\ni have a disabled daughter who has private medication that needs paying for and two other kids to support and this will end us !\n\nair bnb have completely taken our livelihood away\n\nI can understand the very last min cancellations within this week being cancelled and refunded despite that affecting us badly but to leave this policy open so that we cannot state that say after this week if you havent cancelled then our normal policy will apply ! This would have given everyone time to make their decisions and leave us to be able to feed our families .\n\nThe mortgage holiday rule doesn't actually apply to all of us as my tax adviser told me yesterday .\n\ni hope to find another platform soon to join who will protect us\n\nso if we cancel all our bookings on here when we join them do we get away with no fines / charges ??\n\nRe: Service fees and our extenuating circumstances policy\n\nMy host was a jewel and kindly refuned my deposit after I explained my situation. Airbnb DID NOT refund my fees. I'm retired and saved and saved to take my trip from Oregon to SC. So sad that Airbnb is dumping the problem on the host and not refunding their service fee.\n\nRe: Service fees and our extenuating circumstances policy\n\nI have continued to contact them daily and no response. Just their \"canned\" answers. Believe me this is not the end of it. The media needs to know individual hosts are responding in a positive way and losing income and maybe their homes and Airbnb a large corporation profits. Shameful\n\nRe: Service fees and our extenuating circumstances policy\n\nI have a guest that tries to cancel her booking that falls under date range requirements of AirBnB's \"Extenuating circumstances policy and the coronavirus (COVID-19)\".

{"text": "Ukrainian Mail Order Brides – Passion And Beautiful\n\nOur Score\n\nIn the life of every man, a moment comes when he begins to think about serious relationships and finding women for marriage. Because of a solid bank account, financial independence and a big house will not bring happiness.\n\nThere must be a person nearby who will give his love and share your interests and beliefs. But sometimes the search for the second half becomes very difficult – after all, finding the perfect pair is not easy.\n\nHowever, everything can become much easier thanks to modern matrimonial services. These companies will select the best soulmate for you. But only if you have chosen a high-quality dating site and know which girls are right for you. If you chose Ukrainian mail order brides, then you have made the right decision.\n\nWhy The Ukrainian Brides Are Perfect For Marriage\n\nUkraine is the largest country in Europe after Russia. Previously, it was one of the republics of the USSR with a rich economy, large factories, and strong agriculture. But today, not everything is so good here – the country is the poorest in Europe. However, the main wealth has remained the same – it is beautiful Ukrainian women who will become an ideal soulmate thanks to a large set of advantages.\n\nPleasant Character\n\nIf you started dating Ukrainian women, then your relationship will be devoid of negative emotions. These girls know how to respect other people's opinions and do not like disputes or scandals. Besides, Ukrainian mail order brides understand how important it is to give her husband personal freedom, to support and understand him. They try to learn more about his interests and life values ​​to build relationships based on love and mutual respect.\n\nAmazing Beauty\n\nImagine a picture where pretty Ukrainian girls are walking in the background of amazing landscapes under the bright warm sun. Amazing ladies can charm, at first sight, thanks to the natural beauty and grace. Slender figures Ukrainian mail order brides look delightful in any dress, silk hair falls on delicate shoulders, and beautiful eyes are full of love and warmth. But the main thing is a beautiful smile of pretty women, which will delight you.\n\nRelationships Similar To Paradise\n\nThe secret to harmonious relationships is understanding and trust. If you chose Ukrainian girls for marriage, you have made the right decision. Thanks to the light character and excellent sense of humor, they become ideal companions for travel, relationships, and leisure together. Every day begins to shine brighter if a charming Ukrainian bride is next to you. Besides, their excellent sense of humor will make any difficult situation easier. Even in difficult times in life, you will feel this important and necessary support from your partner. Because you chose not just a Ukrainian wife, you chose the perfect soulmate.\n\nThe Perfect Companion\n\nUkrainian mail-order brides possess not only amazing beauty but also a great sense of style. They know how to create the perfect look for any event. But the main thing is that they don't need a lot of time, tons of makeup and expensive dresses. But the result will be amazing – the attention of those around you is guaranteed. However, this attention will not be cause for jealousy if you chose Ukrainian women for marriage because these girls know how to be faithful to their husbands. And you will be delighted when you learn about the magical passion of charming brides.\n\nEmotional Closeness\n\nWe have already said that Ukraine is the poorest country in Europe. But this does not mean that Ukrainian singles are looking for a sponsor. These girls are brought up with respect for traditional family values. They know that closeness is the most important than a financial condition. Ukrainian mail order brides are not looking for a \"golden cage\" – they need a real husband and soul mate, just like you. Besides, they are hardworking and willing to contribute to the family budget. And most importantly – Ukrainian wives can perfectly distribute expenses. So you have enough money for a good life and a wonderful vacation.\n\nComfort And Coziness In Your Home\n\nYour house will turn into paradise if you choose a Ukrainian mail order bride.

With over 40 years combined experience selling real estate, we will ensure that all your real estate needs are met and will guide you every step of the way.\n\nTestimonials\n\nWe bought and sold with Louisa and Carole in a seller's market. We were thrilled to have such a great team to work with as each brought unique qualities. Louisa has endless patience and helped bridge the gap between a hot market and our desire to think things through, while Carole's experience in timing and price points was valuable and set us at ease.\"\"In selling, we knew that houses were moving quickly, and our goals were top dollar, and minimal disruption to our busy household. Carole and Louisa swooped in with their extensive staging gear - even a carpet cleaner! – photographer, and we were ready to go! They helped us know what would and would not be helpful to change, and kept us sane through the process. They solved problems instead of just bringing them to our attention. We trusted them and we sold quickly, for far more than we thought we could get.\"\"Thank you, Louisa and Carole, for all the extra efforts you put into our purchase and sale. We noticed.\"\n\n- Simon Grace & Tess Trethewey,\n\nBeing long time residents of Glenayre, we'd seen Carole Shaw's name on sold signs for many years and we knew that when we wanted to sell our home, there was only one choice. Carole's reputation as a very effective real estate agent is well earned. She advised us on giving our house curb appeal, staged our home, had professional photos done for the listing and walked us through every step of the selling process including setting the right price ! We were very pleased that our home sold quickly and know that Carole's professional approach was the major factor in making this happen. Carole also acted as our agent in purchasing a new home. We appreciated her guidance in formulating an offer and during the negotiation process. Her services continued right through to accompanying us during the home inspection and on possession day. We are happy to recommend Carole's services as a realtor. \"\n\n- Terry & Joanne Walton\n\nWe are very happy to have chosen Louisa Baker as our real estate agent. Louisa is very quick to communicate and offer\nimpartial and well researched advice on a prospective home. Her friendly and easy going nature made the buying and selling\nexperience an easy one. Her attention to detail and outstanding marketing skills are second to none and we could not be happier with the results.\nWe would highly recommend Louisa to anyone who is looking to buy and sell a property.\"\n\n- Dave and Marlena Bailey\n\nShaw & Baker Realtors were amazing to work with. From the beginning we were told \"When you find the right place, you'll know.\" And sure enough they worked with us to find our perfect home. We had a great experience on both the buying and selling side, as we sold our home after just one weekend of open houses! We are sure it was due to the fantastic job they did staging our townhouse. Such a wonderful group of ladies, I would recommend them to anyone!\n\n- John & Amanda Clune\n\nIn spring of 2017, my elderly relatives decided to sell their West Coquitlam home and downsize.

I walk in with thin face, you walk out with puffy face. FOR DAYS! lol ) and my clothing ( most of it) came off.\n\nThis hospital is very surrogate friendly. The nurses, doctors, all of the staff.. every single person i came into contact with, was beyond wonderful. This lady in the photo, sadly I do not remember her name ( we all know how much change overs happen while you are staying at a hospital .. i met so many people!) she was one of my favorites. She was just a real person. She has been doing her job for a while. You can just tell. But I mean that in the best way. She did not beat around the bush. She was hilarious. It was near the end of her shift, I wish i walked in on the beginning of her shift. If you are in my area, and you get her… you will love her. As long as you too have a awesome sense of humor. I wish I could have given her the water birth i planned for… but sadly my body had another route to take.\n\nThis was me showing off my awesome dance moves to my photographer. If you are caught up, you will have seen the post with my video. HA\n\nNow you need to meet my Doula Sue. Seriously. I felt lucky to have scooped her up. She is THE Doula you want. She wears many capes when she shows up for you. Doula, sub-in-mom, friend, your strength when you have lost it, comforter, supporter, bath-room-helper, ice-chip fetch'er ( and feeder!), hot-blanket- getter ,advocate, massage therapist, hard-ass ( when you need to be told you CAN do it) personal cheerleader, the list is endless really. She was my person I took to the operating room. I needed her calmness. She had to be the one. My husband understood. Was almost thankful he did not have to go in. He even admitted how amazing she was, not to just me, but to him, the daddies, everyone involved. She is the reason i held on so long with out meds. She pushed me. Explained things to me. She was everything.\n\nYou should go like her page. And secure her now, if your pregnant. You will not regret it. Tell her Courtney sent you. 🙂\n\nNow… I dunno about you, but when I meet my Doctor team.. it's when i'm coming out of the bathroom, in my underwear ( HELLO DEPENDS!! ) They so kindly introduced themselves. So sweet. Look at that young girl in the photo. She looks still innocent almost. But lets focus on the Doctor for a second. Sadly I do not remember his name. Not because I forgot it … no no… it's because I watch Grey's. And if you are a greys fan, no man doc is remembered for his NAME. no its his NICKNAME. Meet Mc.Baby Doc. ( What?! look at him! he looks so young!)\n\nWhich reminds me of my awesome conversation with him just before I left the hospital. He brought up birth control. I gave him that \" What are you talking about\" look.\n\nThen he gave me that \" Did i say something wrong?\" look\n\nThen he realized that I had my tubes tied. I do not need that little pill every day. And that it's not every day someone comes in, gives birth with tied tubes and 2 men go home with the baby. HA\n\nUgh. I am SO sexy here. But man. Contractions every 2 -3 minutes, for HOURS and HOURS… is enough to make you go bat shit crazy, exhaustion hits. Defeat over comes you. Then you get checked… and you're not dilating. Hello emotional break down.\n\nThis is the moment i break. I am told, after arriving at 11pm on the 4th. and it now the late morning of the 5th. Nothing is moving along… I can't mentally, emotionally and physically handle much more. GIVE THIS GIRL THE MEDS! Once again, Sue to the rescue. Reminding me, its been hours. I am not a failure. Most would have given in long ago. I just thought I was closer to the end then I was. Everything thought I was. To be told i was still 2 cm was… mind-blowing.\n\nBut .. HELLO GAS! You and I are BFFS now. This made the contractions a little more …. ok. Till the big epidural arrived. Which wore off by the way. my one side after a while, still felt them. That sucked. lol\n\nAfter another bunch of hours. Baby having her heart rate drop. I had a choice. To up the meds to induce everything for 45 min in hopes my body just jump starts…. if not, it would potentially be an emergency c-section if baby does not handle it well. OR c-section now. I had another emotional break down. The very thought of a c-section scared me. Its surgery. The healing time after is longer. Its hard on your body. I would have been out of work longer. Everything about this upset me. This was not my end goal. This is not how I wanted them ( daddies to be) to become Dads. I wanted them to watch their daughter be born. Be a part of every moment. That was now taken away. I cried. The doctors, they gave me 5 minutes to let it out. Mentally prepared for it. I needed it. I'm thankful for that.\n\nThe Daddies to be, They even let me keep baby with me, in the OR after she was born. I got to hang out with her. Then when I was wheeled back into the room, they came in. I still got to hand them their daughter. That moment was everything to me. I got to see it. Be a part of it. I'm thankful for that. They gave me that.\n\nSo TADA! look! a baby!\n\nNow yes, That is my breast. Most people passing by this blog, has seen one before, have their very own set, and grasp the fact that baby is eating. This is normal. But whats so special about these photos.. is I got to breast feed her for her first meal. I pumped for her the whole time she was here. She got the best meal for free! I was producing it, might as well give her the good stuff! The daddies even got to fly home with frozen milk to give her and mix with her formula when she arrived home!\n\nDid I bond more with her because i was breast-feeding her? No. This was to give her a meal. We all know how important the first few days of breast milk is so important and good! I had started pre pumping so i had some of my colostrum frozen for them all 🙂\n\nIt's funny thou, she was so healthy she was allowed to leave the hospital less than 3 hours after being born! I on the other hand had to stay. HA But even I escaped early too.\n\nIt's hard to believe that little bundle is 2 months old NEXT WEEK! Where in the world has the time gone?! I get photos almost daily from her Dads. we Skype at least once a week. And we are planning my trip to visit them all this summer. I need to get in some snuggles from her, and spend some time with her amazing Dads.", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "a97f41c0-1040-4d65-bbfd-fcc8cf177ffb", "url": "https://justthestorkdotblog.wordpress.com/2018/01/26/flash-back-friday/"}
{"text": "25 Mother's Day Gift Ideas She'll LoveWith Mother's Day just over a month away, I thought it would be good to cover those gift ideas that most moms I know would really enjoy getting. For the majority of moms, it is so much more about the thought than the actual gift.\n\nSome of my favorite gifts are the homemade cards and gifts, which are truly priceless, but what about gifts that can only be purchased? What about those who are tight on time and limited on funds?\n\nFollowing are some great gift ideas that won't break the bank, yet the moms I know would love to receive. Of course not all moms are coffee or tea drinkers for instance, but there should be something here for everyone.\n\nHere are some easy Mother's Day gift ideas she'll love!\n\n(this post may contain affiliate links. If you make a purchase, I may receive a small commission at no cost to you)\n\nPotted spring flowers, like some blooming tulips that can then be planted in the yard for next year\n\nHopefully, this list gives you some ideas for gifts that can actually be purchased and found nearly anywhere if you are tight on time.

{"text": "RAPTURE #2 is OUT — and other general news of interest!\n\nSorry it's been a while since I've updated, and I have yet to get to all your recent comments.It's been that kind of week I'm afraid. YIKES!LOL!!!\n\nBut I have happy news!RAPTURE #2 is now available!Wow!I feel like this one has been a while in the making, but I couldn't be happier with the result.Spubba the Mad fans rejoice because this is the issue in which Spubba's art debuts at Class Comics with a super hot Incubus story!\n\nI am especially pleased that Locus has his first solo tale in this issue… and I'm really excited to introduce you to 3 new characters I've created!Captain Jung (my first Korean character!), Disco and Flamer all make their debut in this book as well.\n\nSo there's all that and more in store in this book!Check it out when you have a moment!\n\nAlso out this month is RAINBOW COUNTRY #1!I talked a little bit about this title and its creator, artistMax' in a previous post!The book looks great and is realllllllly sexy!You won't want to miss this one either!\n\nAnd last but not least, Fraz, Alexis and I have just updated my personal website, as well as the Class Comics website (the updates there are still ongoing!).We are still looking for a new gallery system so that we can update the Fan Art section of my site more often, so please bear with us as we try to figure all that out.Meanwhile, have a look at what is there… including the very first ZAHN comic strip ever!\n\nSo there you have it, my friends.I promise to try and get to the answering comments very shortly!Once my head stops spinning I think!HA! HA! HA!\n\nComments\n\nLoved the Zahn strip, sword and sorcery is a favorite genre of mine. Also very entertaining with the satirical take on the basic Sword and Sorcery story formula. I definitely look forward to more of Zahn. Also cool monster, touched on some Lovecraftian elements with the appearrance.\n\nThis is great. I ordered both titles first thing this morning. I looked at the preview pages, both look great, as per usual class comics standards. I noticed the colours of Rainbow Country, all the colours jumping out at you, it's extremely vibrant. Rapture #2 I'm really looking forward to. I love your new characters.\n\nThanks for your hard work and dedication to create these new characters and bringing out more great comics. You are much apreciated.\n\nWe have a pal, Kevin, who's already ordered the two new issues. So we'll see 'em soon. We ourselves like to buy from our best bookstore, to support that indy shop. So it'll prob be a while before the issues get stocked there. Thanks for your cool work.\n\nWell you know me being the typical \"I gotta Hhave it NOW\" person I am, made my order for Rapture #2 yesterday.\n\nWas a little shocked at the preview page with N.J & S.C, (I won't give to much away incase people haven't seen it!) But word of note : Next time N.J. should remove the glove, it makes for easier insertion!!!!!!!!! *my lips are sealed*\n\nBeautiful work as always on the website and as I already mentioned to you, the new Class Comics site is fantastic. Really looking forward to seeing Spuba's work, pity it takes almost 2 weeks for delivery to Australia! Makes no matter, makes the wait all the more worthwhile.\n\nGotta go – I have 3 photo shoots happening at my house today and another tomorrow, the place looks like the set of a porn movie, but on the upside, my 2 pussies being female are enjoying the attention and being the only 2 females surrounded by fuck knows how men at the moment!!\n\nJust wanted to let you know and I feel safe in saying I speak for everyone who comments on your blog. We all know that you are a busy person and don't stress out about not replying to the comments we have left for you. We all know that you will get back to us when you have the chance and even if that takes a month to do so none of us will feel that your ignoring us.\n\nTake your time and deal with the matters at hand and that is getting your books out there and perfecting your art & websites as they are the frontline of your work.\n\nYou, Fraz & Alexis, do such a wonderful job putting things together and it must be a real stretch for you at times when you have other artists on board, different lines of comics that you have placed under your umbrella, and focusing on your work plan at the same time.\n\nWe will always be here, and it just makes the wait all the more worth while when you do respond because it gives us all something new to talk about when you do get back to us.\n\nSo from all of us to you, Fraz & Alexis, I am proud to give you all the award for \"Fucking Excellent Effort!\"\n\nLove to you all, my favorite 3 litte chockettes on the break front of life!\n\nOMG I love Locus so much, there's something about green men. And blue men actually, why don't you have Locus and Sethan team up for some blue on green action? It'd be like the world looking like something…*thinks about Bette*\n\nCongratulations on getting Rapture 2 out, it looks awesome from the preview pages. I also noticed the stuff you posted over at y!gallery – all awesome pictures, but the cyclist and the two raver guys (especially the hottie in the green shirt) are incredible! The picture of Dominion you've got up at the news section in your site looks fantastic too – I already love the guy after 1 picture.\n\nThanks for the updates, and there's no need to apologise for not replying to comments. Considering how long it usually takes me to get a single comment out, I can imagine how hard it'd be to reply to everything that gets posted here.\n\nWe should add to what a few others said about you responding to everybody. Not necessary. You're cool in wanting to, but it's not necessary. It's like with your original articles. We don't always feel we have something to say about them, even tho we read them. Likewise, we know you read our comments, but you don't have to respond to every one.\n\nThere're several of us, & only one of you. Too bad, that. What if there were MANY of you! Whoa!\n\nmy orders been made… oh man Patrick, if I were 14 I'd be having wet dreams over thinking about this comic… so thank god I'm 25.\n\nBeen looking forward to rapture 2 for a long time, and that story with these 3 new guys of yours. Also, isn't it in this one that those saydur characters from NJ#1 come after NJ again for revenge, and it shows NJ and space cadet walking down the hallway together. Looking forward to this!\n\nAlso, Rainbow country looks SO HOT!! The first page reminds me of something from GTA vice city, an almost roughness to the characters but drawn with real colour in mind. His is very sexy work.\n\nThanks so much for your enthusiasm regarding these two new books, and all the kind words you wrote!\n\nI will confess something here! Part of my recent stress has been that we at Class Comics have recently left our previous printers. They were wonderful people, and we left on the very best of terms, but as businesses grow and evolve, so too must the way you do things.\n\nThe new people we are dealing with are very nice, and they have done a BRILLIANT job on these two new books. Everything looks so beautiful and crisp and I am MUCH RELIEVED!!! But I must tell you, the STRESS I FELT over this past month, trying to get used to the new printers' way of working, and how they needed the files prepared and allllllllll the other stuff in between was… well it was a little bit overwhelming. As you can probably tell, I don't much care for \"change\"!!! LOL!\n\nSee, in a perfect world, all I would do is draw pretty pictures… but in this world, in the REAL WORLD, I have to do way more than that! LOL!!! I guess it is all part of running Class Comics. All I can say is THANK GOD for Fraser and Alexis! ?\n\nIn any event, I have bitched enough. I just wanted to share with you all how relieved I am that the books are beautifully printed!\n\nI look forward to hearing what you will all think of them when they arrive at your door!\n\nAgain, my sincerest thanks to all of you for your wonderful understanding and continued support! It always really, REALLY helps!", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "3d74816f-4eec-4b6d-8c32-2d3b7fbf962f", "url": "http://www.boytoonsmag.com/2006/10/13/rapture-2-is-out-and-other-general-news-of-interest/"}

{"text": "Personal Blog of a Dagupena Dreamer\n\nTag Archives: john lloyd cruz\n\nHonor Thy Father is the most controversial entry featured at the 2015 Metro Manila Film Festival. I remember being upset when I found out this John Lloyd Cruz starer and the historical women empowerment movie Lakambini led by Lovi Poe didn't make it to the final cut announced last June.\n\nMMFF Awards bagged by 'Honor Thy Father' team\n\nHermano Puli backed out last October due to the lack of budget and by the time Honor Thy Father was offered a slot, the film was already screened at the Toronto International Film Festival and slated to be the opening film of CinemaOne Originals 2015. I read some press releases about that and clearly, the people behind MMFF 2015 are fully aware of the arrangements. The sudden disqualification of Honor Thy Father for the Best Picture award a day before the awards night remains a mystery.\n\nAnyway, I'm not writing this post to update everyone with this ongoing issue (can't keep my mouth shut) as I'm a Pinoy movie fan. I cannot say this is my personal favorite among the 8 entries, but it does deserve a recognition. This is also a 'test' on whether Pinoy moviegoers are open to supporting such theme.\n\nLast Wednesday, Hannah and I met up in our favorite cinema to catch the new John Lloyd Cruz – Bea Alonzo movie entitled 'The Mistress'. Just like in last year's No Other Woman, the cinema almost reached the SRO level. I bought the tickets at 4PM for the 8PM screening. Half of the seats were already booked. Beat that!\n\nOne of Bea Alonzo and John Lloyd Cruz' intense scenes in 'The Mistress'\n\nI am glad that we were able to enter the cinema to catch the trailers of 'This Guy is in Love with You Mare' (Vice Ganda-Luis Manzano-Toni Gonzaga film) and Suddenly It's Magic (Mario Maurer and Erich Gonzales). We were also relieved that finally, Aga and Regine's reunion rom-com 'Of All The Things' is finally set to be shown on the 26th of September. I am hoping it will do good in the box-office.\n\nI first saw the trailer of The Mistress while watching The Reunion. I am quite surprised upon seeing Bea Alonzo's onscreen kiss with veteran actor Ronaldo Valdez, and was delighted to see Hilda Koronel after years of hiatus in the industry. Olivia Lamasan is really the best when it comes to mainstream mature dramas.\n\nJohn Lloyd Cruz is undeniably one of the most talented actors in the country today. Not only that – he is also an effective product endorser. No wonder he has a number of deals under his belt including a pizza food chain, clothing line, shoe brand, mobile phone, canned good among others. Of course, the most-loved and sincere among them all is his Biogesic campaign with the popular tagline \"Ingat!\"\n\nJohn Lloyd Cruz and Bea Alonzo with the Cast and Crew of Miss You Like Crazy\n\nMost of his fans miss him already in the ABS-CBN Primetime Bida block. He was last seen as Armando in the Philippine version of I Love Betty La Fea where he was paired with long-time screen partner, Bea Alonzo. To be honest, I am a big John Lloyd Cruz-Bea Alonzo fanatic. I've seen all their movies – My First Romance, Now That I Have You, Close to You, All About Love, One More Chance and of course, Miss You Like Crazy", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "22efb7b2-57fc-443b-8cde-e43e88a84cf9", "url": "http://micamyx.com/tag/john-lloyd-cruz/"}

{"text": "Pawn Stars\n\nExclusive\n\n10/10/2021 12:50 AM PT\n\nChumlee is a whole new man ... after practically losing an entire man's weight.\n\nThe guy from \"Pawn Stars\" tells TMZ ... he was tired of struggling with his weight, which constantly fluctuated 100 pounds at a time. He says it had been a years-long battle and he felt it was time to make a drastic change after getting all the way up to 350 pounds in January 2019.\n\nThat dramatic change started the following month when he went in for gastric sleeve surgery ... a popular weight-loss procedure in which a large portion of the stomach is removed to create a smaller stomach pouch.\n\nThis, of course, reduces the quantity of food one can eat while making them feel fuller even when consuming less food. The stomach size is brought down to about the size of a banana.\n\nAs you can see, Chumlee's looking slim at 190 pounds now. He says he went through the 160-pound transformation because he wanted to not only get healthy, but stay healthy ... unlike his years of yo-yoing.\n\nWaiting for your permission to load the Instagram Media.\n\nChumlee, who got the procedure done at Blossom Bariatrics in Vegas, says now that he's slimmed down he's committed to maintaining his weight by embracing a lifestyle change ... eating clean, healthy food and getting his sweat on.\n\nIn the docs, Rick says during the course of their marriage their \"tastes, mental dispositions, views, likes, and dislikes have become so divergent that they have become incompatible in marriage\" ... and there was no hope for reconciliation as husband and wife.\n\nDeanna initially responded to the divorce filing by asking for alimony, but according to the docs ... the exes reached a settlement agreement in September 2020 finalizing all issues like alimony, support and property division.\n\nRick and Deanna don't have any minor children together, but Rick tells us \"I got 3 great daughters out of it\" ... referring to Deanna's children from a previous relationship.\n\nRick adds that the marriage \"didn't work out and [the divorce] was a mutual decision,\" and he's moved on.\n\nEXCLUSIVE\n\n6/26/2018 1:50 PM PT\n\nChumlee's relationship with Richard Harrison spanned about 20 years, and he has a lot of fond memories of the man they called \"Old Man\" ... and some funny ones too.\n\nThe \"Pawn Stars\" star tells \"TMZ Live\" ... even though \"Old Man\" wasn't truly his family, he was always treated like a grandson and he learned many life lessons from him.\n\nChumlee says he's happy he got to spend some time with Harrison in recent weeks as he battled Parkinson's Disease and, while he was prepared for the inevitable, it was still a surprise when he died ... because \"Old Man\" always fought like hell.\n\nChumlee tells us the outpouring of love for the \"Pawn Stars\" patriarch has been incredible, and he shared his favorite memory -- taking \"Old Man\" for a ride in his lowrider, and giving him a surprise hydraulics lesson.\n\nAs we told you, the famed Gold & Silver shop in Vegas created a memorial to honor Richard, and it's been flooded by fans paying their respects.\n\nEXCLUSIVE\n\n6/26/2018 8:38 AM PT\n\nThe famed \"Pawn Stars\" shop is already honoring its TV patriarch, Richard Harrison, a day after his death ... and fans can pay their respects in a number of ways.\n\nSources close to the family of Richard, best known as \"Old Man,\" tell TMZ ... a makeshift memorial was set up in the corner of the Gold & Silver shop in Las Vegas in remembrance of their late founder. As we reported, \"Old Man\" died Monday ... and his memorial is already getting tons of love.\n\nThe shrine includes his signature chair, hat and coffee cup -- plus a life-sized cutout of him and photos from his office too. We're told fans and customers alike have been dropping off flowers and other items in droves.\n\nFamily sources also tell us ... a number of celebs have reached out with condolences, ranging from Russell Crowe to Dana White and the NHL's Golden Knights hockey to The Oak Ridge Boys quartet. We're told the outpouring of support has been incredible.\n\nAs for donations ... the Harrison family wants any monies sent to the Epilepsy Foundation ... an affliction his son Rick dealt with as a child.\n\nWe're told the Gold & Silver shop will remain open this week except perhaps for a couple hours, so employees can attend a private service. A public service is forthcoming as well.\n\nEXCLUSIVE\n\n6/25/2018 7:15 AM PT\n\n9:09 AM PT -- Sources close to Harrison tell us he passed after losing his battle with Parkinson's Disease.\n\nRichard Harrison -- famously known as \"Old Man\" on \"Pawn Stars\" -- has died, according to his son, Rick Harrison.\n\n'''The Old Man' Harrison passed away this morning surrounded by those he loved,\" Rick said Monday morning ... \"He will be tremendously missed by our family, the team at Gold & Silver Pawn and his many fans the world over.\"\n\n\"He was my hero and I was fortunate to get a very cool 'Old Man' as my dad.\"\n\nThe circumstances surrounding his death are unclear. However, Harrison's appearances on the show over the last couple years were slim to none.\n\n'Old Man' moved to Vegas back in the early '80s and opened the Gold & Silver Pawn Shop with his son, Rick.\n\nWhen the producers found the family and turned their daily lives into a show, it became an instant success. It's been on the air since July 2009 with 'Old Man' as one of the fan favorites.\n\nA rep for History Channel tells TMZ, \"We are deeply saddened by the loss of our friend Richard 'The Old Man' Harrison, a beloved member of the HISTORY and 'Pawn Stars' family. He will be greatly missed for his wisdom and candor.\"\n\nHarrison is a Navy veteran and often talked about his military career on the show.\n\nEXCLUSIVE\n\n5/29/2018 12:30 AM PT\n\n\"Pawn Stars\" Jesse Amoroso says Kurt Cobain's \"MTV Unplugged\" guitar is a piece of rock and roll history and belongs someplace special ... in other words -- NOT with Frances Bean's ex-husband.\n\nThe guitar expert and Cowtown Guitars owner tells TMZ ... Kurt's 'Unplugged' performance with the 1959 Martin D-18E is synonymous with the '90s and as iconic as the white Fender Stratocaster Jimi Hendrix shredded with at Woodstock.\n\nAmoroso says because Cobain played the acoustic-electric Martin -- which is already a rare guitar because only 302 were ever made -- it's basically priceless ... though he estimates it could easily fetch close to a million bucks or more at auction.\n\nJesse also tells us if Cobain's 'Unplugged' guitar ends up on sale, he hopes it ends up someplace where it will be appreciated ... like Seattle's Museum of Pop Culture or the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame.\n\nEXCLUSIVE\n\n5/23/2018 12:20 AM PT\n\nDiddy's got a keen eye for fine art, and his historic purchase of a Kerry James Marshall painting is a huge score for him and a bigger score for the artist ... according to a famous expert.\n\nBrett Maly -- the fine art appraiser from \"Pawn Stars\" -- tells TMZ ... Diddy deserves a lot of praise for making all the right moves before dropping $21.1 MILLION on Marshall's 1997 work \"Past Times\" during a Sotheby's auction last week.\n\nMaly says the combo of focusing on an acclaimed artist AND going after one of his most important pieces is a baller move ... and Diddy certainly made a splash.\n\nAs for that splash ... Brett tells us it should have a ripple effect for Marshall -- who's sold million-dollar paintings in the past -- by boosting his sales a few more million ... per piece. Not too shabby, especially since Puff's purchase already made him the most expensive living African-American artist.\n\nBrett also seems to be on the same page as Diddy's son, Quincy Brown -- who says his dad's now a major player in the art world ... get used to it.\n\nEXCLUSIVE\n\n8/14/2017 12:50 AM PT\n\nChumlee's in a battle for the domain name domination over his candy store ... and winning won't be as easy as taking candy from a baby.\n\nThe \"Pawn Stars\" star had his lawyers fire off a letter to Patrick Keys -- the current owner of chumleescandy.com and chumleescandyontheblvd.com -- threatening to take legal action if he doesn't hand over the rights to the sites. Keys has no association to the brick and mortar store that Chumlee opened 2 months ago in Vegas.\n\nKeys tells TMZ ... he's been making his living for 20 years buying and selling domain names, and when news broke in May that Chumlee was opening the candy store ... he made a smart business move by swiping the domains. He says he tried contacting Chumlee several times to work out a deal for the names, but never heard back.\n\nChumlee's legal team's not having it. His rep tells us ... cybersquatter Keys jacked their trademarks while Chumlee was in the process of planning a site ... and that's why the cease and desist letter.\n\nEXCLUSIVE\n\n7/26/2017 12:20 AM PT\n\nChumlee's done partying his ass off ... in one spot anyway -- the infamous Vegas home where cops once found guns and weed is on the market.\n\nThe \"Pawn Stars\" cast member listed his 5 bedroom, 6 bathroom pad for a whopping $1,849,900. It's a sweet deal if he gets his asking price -- he bought it 5 years ago for $1.1 mil.\n\nThe 6,206 square foot pad has a pool, spa and guest house. It's really a bachelor's paradise where Chumlee famously partied hard ... until cops searched the house in March 2016 and found more than 120 grams of weed and 12 guns. He eventually got off with 3 years probation.\n\nKyle Gluhm from Realty ONE Group is listing the home, which includes the \"Chum Chum\" room ... stripper pole included. Strippers NOT included, we're guessing.\n\nBreaking News\n\n5/23/2016 9:52 AM PT\n\nChumlee from \"Pawn Stars\" laid out his plea deal for the judge in his drugs and guns case, and left court one step closer to dodging a huge bullet ... aka jail time.\n\nTMZ broke the story ... Chumlee's attorneys scored him a sweet deal where he'll get off without a single day behind bars for his arrest for drug and weapon possession.\n\nHe was in a Las Vegas court Monday morning to lay out the terms for the judge -- 3 years probation, plus counseling ... and if he keeps his nose clean, the felonies will be dropped to misdemeanors. The judge still has to approve the deal.\n\nOutside the courthouse, we asked Chumlee about his penchant for buying weed \"in bulk\" -- as he explained to cops when they raided his home.\n\nEXCLUSIVE\n\n5/18/2016 3:41 PM PT\n\nChumlee is dodging serious jail time in his drugs and guns case, and will NOT face any sex assault charges ... TMZ has learned.\n\nThe \"Pawn Stars\" cast member was busted back in March when Vegas cops raided his home during a sex assault investigation. TMZ broke the story ... cops say they found at least one gun as well as a bunch of marijuana.\n\nAccording to docs obtained by TMZ ... the D.A. will charge Chumlee with felony possession of a firearm and felony possession of a controlled substance -- but the twist is ... his attorneys got him a sweet plea deal.\n\nWe don't know all the terms of the deal, but our sources say the big one is Chumlee will get probation and NO jail time. We're told the 2 felonies will eventually become misdemeanors once he completes probation.\n\nAs for the alleged sexual assault ... we're told police and Chumlee's attorneys, David Chesnoff and Richard Schonfeld, ran an exhaustive investigation. Both sides found there was not enough evidence to charge him.\n\nEXCLUSIVE\n\n5/2/2015 12:15 AM PT\n\nThe guys from \"Pawn Stars\" can spot a money making opportunity from a mile away -- which is why they believe a Mayweather LOSS would be HUGE for the city of Las Vegas in the long run.\n\nDon't get it twisted ... Corey and Rick Harrison -- who were hangin' at the D Hotel -- told us they're rooting for the hometown guy, Floyd Mayweather ... but explain why Floyd taking the \"L\" would be MUCH BETTER for Sin City.\n\nExclusive Details\n\n5/2/2014 10:55 AM PT\n\nCorey Harrison from \"Pawn Stars\" flung himself off a moving vehicle Saturday to avoid a MAJOR crash ... and the reality star miraculously lived to tell the tale.\n\nHarrison's family and friends were throwing him a birthday party this weekend at his house ... but before the bash, he left on his motorcycle to grab a few supplies.\n\nCorey says a piece of the bottom fender mount suddenly broke off ... sending his bike into a tailspin at 40 mph. The reality star was faced with two options -- fly into a nearby wall/oncoming traffic, or jump off the bike. He chose door #2.\n\nHarrison was not about to let partygoers down ... so he chose to go to the party instead of the hospital. After the party he took a trip to the ER where he learned he had a broken hand. Doctors surgically placed 8 screws and 2 plates into his busted hand.\n\nCorey couldn't celebrate the party he hoped to have Monday night at the D Hotel and Casino in Vegas ... so they ended up bringing the party to him ... at his humble abode.", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "cf562cd5-d5cb-4c45-a7bc-e33ecb27d50a", "url": "https://www.tmz.com/categories/pawn-stars/"}

{"text": "Seat Upholstery Kit\n\nRecommended Posts\n\nIn the process of redoing the seats, and ordered the foam and seat covers from Interior Innovations (I think they come out of Pakistan).\n\nPictured is my passenger bottom with the new vinyl cover from Interior Innovations, along with my original back. Color is a dull matte color, but the original is more glossy, has two different textured materials. Kind of a shame to redo the top since it looks pretty decent, but have no choice. Kind of bummed how this is turning out. I asked a couple months ago here about which kit others are using, but not much response. I like the material used on this threads seat, except they're missing the vents.\n\nIMHO, I would pull that kit off and call Mike at Banzai Motors and order the proper seat covers.\n\nI agree! Thanks for the Banzai lead, wish I knew that a month ago. 🤷‍♂️ Hopefully my new foam will work with Banzai's kit. There might be some slightly used seat covers in the classified section in a few weeks.\n\nLink to comment\n\nShare on other sites\n\nFinally got the seats done and reinstalled. I did the passenger side seat, but had a pro do the driver seat since it was more worn and needed some foam work. Waiting for the side mechanism covers to come in.\n\nGoing to try to sell the old seat covers that go over the top of your worn out seats. They actually don't look too bad if wanting a quick temporary fix until you can do it right. Not sure where they came from, but definitely different than what I see available now. If anyone here wants them, just pay shipping and they're yours.\n\nAlso going to sell the seat covers and foam I purchased from Innovative Interiors (paid $680) that I didn't use. I'll probably try Craigslist first due to shipping costs, then eBay if needed. Going to loose my shirt on these.", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "29d5484d-9796-4e84-ba04-cfe2c3161cc4", "url": "https://www.classiczcars.com/forums/topic/66012-seat-upholstery-kit/"}

{"text": "As I reported last post: I was expecting that I'll have to eventually get a new phone contract to allow the family the perception that they are in constant (potential) contact with me.\n\nHowever, I've reached a temporary setback.\n\nWe have a FIDO \"couples\" plan. But only one phone on it at the moment because I removed my old phone last summer. But I didn't change the plan because I wanted be able to add a phone back on to it. And so I called them and asked to do that.\n\nNot so fast. To add a phone to this \"existing\" couples plan, that has only one phone on it, triggers a new 2-year contract. I've been a FIDO customer for 9 years. I don't owe them any 2-year-contract. Ever again. But, says the customer rep, you can change the existing plan to a \"legacy\" single-number plan (with no fixed term contract) and add a new no-contract phone (as a separate account, I assume). But then we lose the pooled minutes and the legacy plan has too many minutes on the wrong phone. I told the nice pleasant customer-service rep that if I have to start new plans or new 2-year-contracts it triggers the necessity for me to research the other phone providers (including new ones coming this year) because I can't assume that what Fido is forcing me to change to would be best for me. She told me I'll have to do that homework.\n\nDamn. Looks like I'm back to square one. Ever since Rogers bought Fido, my phone company has been an obstacle who acts like they're out to screw me.\n\nThis entry was posted on Thursday, January 28th, 2010 at\n12:50 pm and is filed under Nomads, Tech.\nYou can follow any responses to this entry through the\nRSS 2.0 feed.\nYou can\nleave a comment, or\ntrackback from your own site.\nYou can .", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "74cd8eb5-4184-4ae2-9672-d0cf7019f5ea", "url": "http://www.digitalcobbler.com/?p=327"}

Rather, we strive to place a diverse spectrum of independent publisher inventory in front of advertiser eyeballs in an efficient and user-friendly manner. Internet Ad Sales does not charge any commission for advertising inventory purchases made through the IAS Media Marketplace.\n\nThis Xoops-based service is built on an extensively modified version of the MyLinks module, customized with the addition of numerous new fields intended to streamline the site selection process for potential advertisers. Sites are categorized and sortable according to a number of new criteria specific to the profiles of commercial web publishers with available banner inventory.\n\nDuring our beta-testing and rollout phase, all web publishers who submit a new web property will, if accepted, remain permanently listed at no charge. Following the testing and rollout phase, newly submitted sites will incur a low annual fee for listing.\n\nWe encourage all web publishers that carry advertising or sponsorships on their sites to take advantage of the testing phase to submit their sites for a free, permanent listing. Registration is required for submission.\n\nNo, I'm pretty sure that's not it. No wonky html in my templates, as far as I can tell. But I just took another look at mainfile.php and realized that I must have changed the \"virtual path to xoops\" setting to \" from \" at the same time I added the hack code, just to add another variable to the mix. That would explain the basic change in behavior.\n\nThings are too chaotic around here at the moment for me to test the four combinations properly (www and no www, each with and without the hack enabled), but I suspect there might be a slim chance the problem has something to do with the way the hack translates the URL for the default start module in the particular case that:\n\nOn another site I run, the exact opposite occurs.  has that URL defined as the virtual path and works fine with the hack. The same URL with www, i.e. http// suffers from blank page syndrome.\n\nIt's not that big a problem, but it would still be preferable to display a partial load of Xoops, minus the default module, than a blank page. I suppose the simplest workaround would be to add another redirector to .htaccess that would add or strip the www as needed. Anyone know a simple line of code to do that?\n\nRe: FAQ problem (strange URL)\n\nAnd yet another question. After installing the hack, links to the site URLs that do not include the \"www\", e.g.  of which there are many, no longer work, whereas they did previously. Any idea what may be the cause? And could there be a nice simple workaround?", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "4e82f5a9-d483-4959-9418-fcd2b39f54b2", "url": "https://xoops.org/modules/newbb/viewpost.php?uid=10009"}

{"text": "\"A Low Life In high Heels\" is number seven in the series of twelve monthly 3 inch CDR releases that are been released through-out 2011 by Irelands Bored Bear Recordings. Each release in the series celebrates, pays tribute and chronicles one of the many projects of highly influential & respected Texas noise artist's Richard Ramirez.\n\nThe Gender Sabotage project has been going since 2007,& has put out ten or so releases since then that take in splits & stand alone tape/CDR releases- the project is just another solo endeavour. Sound wise I guess you'd describe it as stuck Harsh noise texturing meets HNW churn. The projects subject/ theme is seemingly based around the world of transsexual prostitutes, actors and genreal transsexual life. And this particular release seems to focus in the life of Holly Woodlawn, a 'Warhol' drag queen protégée who is mentioned in one of the verses of Lou Reeds \"Walk On the Wild side\"\n\nThis 3inch cdr features three tracks in all that run between just under the three minute mark to just over the eight & a half minute mark. First up we have \"Candy Darling\" which is the shortest of the bunch at the 2.51 mark, and this track is built around a rolling noise wall which keeps randomly catching every 5 to 10 second- it sounds like a subtle skipping cd or jumping record of a walled noise track. The first few times I heard the track I found it a little too jarring, but over time I'll have to say it's quite grown on me.\n\nTrack two is entitled \"Nono Noona\" and is the longest of the three tracks at 8.33 mark, and this track nicely alternates between stuck billowing almost slowed down industrial noise texture and slow crusty textural noise descends. I think it's my favourite of the three tracks here as a really like the way you get sucked in & entranced by one textures, then Ramirez slides into the second texture like a knife sliding into belly flesh.\n\nLastly we have \"A Girle Boy\" and this track is built around tight 'n' taut juddering noise textures- I guess this track is more of a straight forward textural noise attack, but it never the less is very worthwhile and it really nicely warps you in contagious and un-escapable textural judder for it just over seven minute runtime\n\nSo this another worthy chapter to this series of 12 releases, and shows once again a slightly different side to Ramirez noise-making. Of interest to those who enjoy a place between stuck and looped harsh noise & HNW texturing.", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "850ec0b6-4942-451c-9964-18d9e58d8296", "url": "https://www.musiquemachine.com/reviews/reviews_template.php?id=3309"}

{"text": "This is my eighteenth Nordstrom Anniversary Sale, and I haven't missed one yet. Wow. Time flies and I can barely believe it. I spent time at the Seattle Nordstrom flagship store last week helping clients preselect items for their wardrobes. Generally it was a good sale. There are dressier items aplenty, with Athleisure and super casual items taking a backseat.\n\nInterestingly, the flagship used to stock most NAS items in at least one colour. But those days are gone, as shopping online in the US takes centre stage. Although it's always fun to see NAS items in store, you'll get the best of the best if you shop the sale online too. It's especially better for getting the right size and colour. I had a good appointment at the flagship and found great stuff, but supplemented my wishlist with an online order. I found fab stuff for hubs Greg too.\n\nThe NAS is full of great jackets and coats across an assortment of silhouettes, fits and sizes. Some looks are tailored, and others fluid, and oversized. There are lots of earth tones and fashion neutrals, but non-neutrals, patterns and brights are represented too. There are several relatively inexpensive items that are very well made, and look better than the designer pieces. Lots of sustainably and ethically produced items too.\n\nThis year I will highlight what is DIFFERENT and fab as opposed to winners we see every year. Often, the stock photos do not do the Items justice and that's where my firsthand impressions will help. Items in the collections show one colour and size, but often come in a range. My lists are by no means exhaustive, so please add to them in the comments section.\n\nIMPORTANT: Make sure you're wearing the right layers under coats and jackets when you choose a size.\n\nCoats\n\nTheory Wool & Cashmere Utility Coat: This is GORGEOUSLY luxe and a more rich lilac in person. Boxy and roomy, yet the shaped hem creates subtle structure. It has handy side entry pockets. The sleeves can be cuffed back if they are long.\n\nOPEN EDIT Relaxed Blazer: The stock photo gives the wrong impression of this awesome peacoat. It has a fab Japanese architectural vibe when buttoned up. Genius sleeve design but long and easily hemmed. Lightweight and warm. Boxy and very fluid, yet streamlined and clean. It's suppose to look big and is not a classic tailored peacoat. Roomy on the hips. Nicely made and $99. Fab fabric. You get a better impression when you scroll through the pics. I have the navy and sized down. An easy throw-on-and-go. It has fab side entry pockets.\n\nBernardo Hooded Quilted Long Jacket: If this came in more colours, most of my clients would have it. VERY well made, robust, unique, and fits a range of body types. It might have an inner drawcord for a bit of shaping. Casually chic.\n\nHalogen Brushed Plaid Peacoat: One of my clients wouldn't take this off, she loved it so much. VERY cosy and fun. For Team Green, and can work on petites.\n\nNordstrom Short Wool Blend Peacoat: A classic peacoat with a Modern Retro sensibility. You either love the gigantic collar or you don't. Can work well on a larger bust. Rich colour.\n\nBernardo Houndstooth Check Wool Blend Coat: I love the Modern Retro vibe of this coat. It is GORGEOUS. It has AMAZING architectural and billowing sleeves, that might be overwhelming - but remember that to some extent, that is the point of the look. Oversized and beautiful quality. Long and not easy to hem for shorter arms. Love the fabric, colour, and is handmade apparently. I don't know what that means, but it has a label that indicates that. Unlined but warm. Stunning length too.\n\nBernardo Tailored Longline Coat: Sleek, streamlined and classic. Works on a range of body types. Works well on a larger bust. Subtle and simple. Beautiful quality and fabric. Absolutely GORGEOUS detailed stitching on the front and back that accentuate the princess lines. Versatile length for skirts and dresses. It's more of a maxi length on me, and I'm 5ft 6. Comes in tan. The navy is mine.\n\nJackets\n\nZella Quilted Pocket Jacket: This looks MUCH better in person and is a super easy mega casual throw-on-and-go. It's straight and hangs very well. Fab quality and comes in black. Super duper on a larger bust, and or broad shoulder line.\n\nHalogen Leather Moto Jacket: Best versatile non-moto leather jacket at the sale if you wear black. Great fit and drape. Nice quality. Longer length works well with pants and jeans.\n\nCinq A Sept Kylie Blazer: Very fun oversized blazer with loads of embellishment and embroidery. Check out the back detailing. Extremely lightweight, and handy scrunched sleeves. Size down a size.\n\nSAVE THE DUCK Joan Water Repellent Recycled Nylon Puffer Jacket: BEST short puffer at the NAS if you don't need a hood. Save the Duck is hands down my favourite brand of puffer because I prefer not to wear down. Lightweight, easy to launder, excellent quality, comfy, and feels fabulous. This one has an architectural collar and a nice shape. You might need to size down. The colour is too grey for me, and not as blue in person. Could be great on you.\n\nVeronica Beard Farley Stand Collar Blazer: Structured Tailored Polished Fabness. Impeccable quality, gorgeous rich colour, and might run a size big. The stretch and good fit makes it mould to a range of body types. Can be worn as an item, or as a suit with matching trousers. I have the blazer and bought bottoms to create a suit.\n\nSAVE THE DUCK Demi Water Repellent Recycled Nylon Puffer Jacket: I can't rave enough about this style of puffer and the GENIUS zipper. I have the citron from last season that is my favourite short puffer of all time. It's streamlined and shaped, very warm, weather resistant, and lightweight. The infinity zipper zips as high up as you want it to, so you can create excellent insulation, especially when wearing the hood.\n\nBLANKNYC Faux Leather Moto Jacket: BEST faux leather jacket at the NAS. Beautifully made, very polished, and looks better than the designer faux leather that was on offer. Gold hardware is only on the peachy toffee colour option. The sage and black have silver hardware. The tiny bottom front pocket is a unique touch. Short length looks great with skirts and dresses. Narrow fit. It's $60 well spent.\n\nTreasure&Bond Collarless Quilt Jacket: An incredible architectural jacket with a Japanese vibe. Very COS-esque too. Fab rich shade of navy. Well made, genius shallow V-neckline, and the quilted stitching is perfectly lined up. Click the link to see it closed. The sleeves turn back if they are too long. Nice high-low neckline. $79 well spent.\n\nVince Camuto Geo Jacquard Ponte Blazer: AMAZING oversized on trend blazer that is soft, stretchy, semi-structured, and dressy. Very comfy. It is GORGEOUS and looks designer with the matching sleeveless halter neck top to create a TWINSET effect. Fab with black bottoms or jeans. Every client who tried on the twinset effect of jacket with matching top loved it.\n\nAllSaints Dalby Leather Biker Jacket: BEST leather moto at the NAS. Beautifully made, simple, sleek, and is a versatile length. Size up at least one size for a tailored fit. Two sizes for a fluid fit.\n\nNordstrom Hooded Quilted Jacket: This olive puffer has a tapered back that structures the topper in an interesting way. Super cute on a range of body types. Straight, yet shaped.\n\nAVEC LES FILLES Relaxed Blazer: '80s Jacket Fabness for Team Mustard, although it comes in black. Has a bit of a '40s integrity too. Rounded architectural fit with beautiful sleeve darts.\n\nShare this Post\n\nThere are a handful of posts I look forward to every year. The thorough and detailed NAS posts rank high on that list. As always you manage to find the best, and in a variety of styles and price points, so that there's something for almost everyone. Looking forward to the rest of the posts. I appreciate all of the work that must go into all of this. Thank you.\n\nThere are some nice styles online but not a whole lot represented in the store nearest me, so this roundup is nice. The prevailing styles of shacket cuts, double-breasted straight cuts and low stances don't work well for me, and colors are still a bit off for me this season, but that Edelman trench is at home with me to evaluate with my cool-weather wardrobe. I don't need coats — I have plenty — but it's a very appealing style with some longevity. I just need to figure out whether it will earn enough wear to stay in my rather full coat closet!\n\nThere was a pretty sage-green color BB Dakota faux leather blazer, but the cut didn't work on me — the shoulders fit but it seemed too narrow in the front of the chest and I got those weird diagonal folds coming from the shoulder pads.\n\nI am always looking forward to your picks and summaries, Angie, and you never disappoint. Out if the items shown I got the All Saints cream moto which is gorgeous, and still waiting for the VB burgundy jacket to ship. I was hoping to try the Reiss cream blazer but it was gone after the first day. Lot of fun coats around as well, however it is slightly annoying that I was hoping for a midi coat in one of the three colors: burgundy, light blue or cream, and not a single option in either of them. There were other blazers that were tempting, so I'd say jackets are the highlight for me this NAS.\n\nAngie – thanks so much for the intel and the incredible list!! My shopping day starts the 13th so I'll be getting up wee hours to place my order. I was interested if you saw the Halogen double breasted leather trench coat at $199. That's really inexpensive for leather and I was not sure about the quality. Also it's only 36″ and I was looking for something more knee length. But I was interested if you got a look at it and if so your thoughts.\n\nI like your approach of focusing on what is different and fab.\nMmmm that open edit blazer in the bison colour is calling out to me….and I see it on Nordstrom Canada website.\nThank you for these amazing round ups!\n\nAngie – yes that's the one. Good to know on sizing. I usually size up because I'm usually sizing up because I always wear a blazer. Deciding if I should stay on task with footwear only. It's a want. Not a need. But I've been browsing leather trenches for awhile..\n\nThe faux leather jacket is now high on my radar thanks to you, Angie! Hopefully it will work for me. I will be able to tell on the fit pretty quickly.\n\nThe red and white Bernardo with the big sleeves also caught my eye. The silhouette isn't my best, but I like the fun sleeves and the color a lot. Hopefully I can find it in store to test multiple sizes (since my measurements are IN multiple sizes).\n\nEighteen years – wow, that is a good long run! I'm so glad you feature items that are different and new. That strategy makes your picks stand out from the crowd, along with the fact that you actually fit the items on your clients and provide details that often make all the difference in the world.\n\nThe houndstooth Bernardo is so tempting! Since the model is 5'10\" I think it could be the perfect mid-knee or just below the knee length that I'm looking for, and I've been wanting a coat that I can layer a jacket underneath.\n\nI can't tell you how much I appreciate your reviews. I've ordered many a top pick over the years, and I have never been disappointed.\n\nWow- thanks for the beautiful selection of finds. Interesting pieces. The T and B quilted jacket and VC Geo Jacquard are possibilities. Love the VB blazer; seems to be sold out. May reappear? Fun to browse all the options.\n\nI saw the Zella quilted jacket in the store and was very tempted to try it on. So cute, and a double zipper. I don't need it, though, and am trying to be practical. (So hard!!)\nI'm glad to see MY blazer is a top pick (1.State). I found it so much better in person.\nI can imagine I would not want to take off that green plaid coat, either, Angie. Another one that really appealed to me, but I resisted trying on because I don't need it.\n\nThe blue Bernardo hooded walker made it onto my wee NAS list, even though I need another coat like I need a hole in the head. I just couldn't resist the color. I had a similar coat in that shade years ago that my DH just loved. Now, I'm toying with the idea of ordering the Bernardo houndstooth. Those sleeves are calling me. Down girl!!\n\nAngie, your descriptions are always SO helpful! You making online shopping so much easier. I love the way you note some key features that a person might not think to wonder about, that turn out to be deal-makers or breakers.\n\nWell the VB suit is my favorite because I saw it on a gorgeous model and was gobsmacked! I also really like the pink Bernardo and recently thrifted a jacket that has a similar silhouette to the V&B minus the skull!\n\nHello everyone! It's been ages since I've been online, but shopping the anniversary sale with Angie always brings me back to check in on the forum. So fun to see so many familiar faces!\n\nLucky me, to shop with Angie and of course several of these top picks came home with me.\n\nCoats:\nThe Sam Edelman mixed media trench is FAB and I'll admit to being the one who didn't want to take off the green Halogen Brushed Plaid Peacoat – so soft and cozy!!\n\nJackets:\nI wear a lot of leather blazers and jackets at work in lieu of suit jackets, so NAS is a great time to refresh this workhorse area of my closet. The black leather Halogen moto jacket is great and I LOVE the All Saints white leather jacket. Angie convinced me to step outside of my comfort zone (after all, that's why I shop with her!) and I loved the effect of the twin set of the Vince Camuto jacket and top.\n\nAngie, I just noticed that you describe the Bernardo houndstooth as unlined. But, the Nordies and Bernardo websites describe it as lined. Is there perhaps a partial lining in the sleeves? The brown version on the Bernardo website appears to have a larger check pattern on the collar and inside, albeit not a lining that's 100% polyester, which is what the description reads, so I'm assuming that the website descriptions aren't quite correct.

{"text": "Joey Silvera Review\n\nJoey Silvera has had a long career in the porn video business, from being a male performer in adult films from the 1970's to the 1990's, to now producing his own movie series and of course this website.\n\nThe website is highly understated in design, in fact if you didn't know who Joey Silvera was, or didn't have this review to go by, you'd figure this wasn't a great site, or an old one perhaps. Thankfully it's much better than it might first appear.\n\nWhat's inside is a large collection of pictures, one gallery per girl. There are several categories, such as Asians, Teens, Pussy Place, and even a really big Shemale section, if you want a chick… with a dick.\n\nThere are easily 200-300 models on the site, especially if you include the guys… dressed up as girls.\n\nOne thing that was really confusing me at first was the end of the galleries. They seemed to kind of stop abruptly, and often never turn hardcore. It turns out the \"next gallery\" and \"previous gallery\" buttons don't change when you're looking at the thumbnails for any set, but their function does. The \"next gallery\" button needs to be clicked to see the next page of pictures for that girl. Often all of the hardcore happens in these last page to half page of pictures.\n\nSome of the older content looks a bit dated, but the photo quality is good throughout. I'd like to see some higher resolution photos though.\n\nThe girls who appear on this site are mostly \"in the business\" meaning they're not new to this kind of thing. If you like imperfect looking girls who look like they've been around the block or the football team a few times, this site is definitely for you. There are some famous hot ladies here, like Patricia Ford and Kobe Tai, but there's also a lot of other amateur stripperish looking women too.\n\nThe videos on the site are broken into ~1 minute clips, and are seperately organized from the photos section. They're offered in both DiVX and RM formats. There are many fewer videos than photo sets.\n\nOverall a good site, it could easily use a facelift, but the content is all there for your pleasure. Don't let the tranny stuff scare you, unless you're scared of yourself. It's neatly tucked aside – no pun intended!

{"text": "Where I've Been and Where I'll Be (at RomCon)\n\nJust got back last night from a family vacation–Mr. James got a short \"furlough\" from the Big Case he's working on and we decided to treat the Little Guy to some fun. Any guesses where we went? Here's a hint:\n\nAh, Disney World with a three year-old. . . there's no experience quite like it. Yes, the Little Guy had his moments–what three year-old doesn't?–but we had a fantastic time. Although I would like to have a word with the Disney \"imagineers\" about one thing–do we really need a gift shop stocked with TOYS after every ride?? Help a parent out here, guys. : )\n\nLater this week, I'm off to Denver for RomCon. For those of you attending the conference, I thought I'd post the schedule of places you can find me:\n\nSaturday, July 10th: 3:30 PM The Perfect Heroine: What makes a heroine a woman you can identify with? Do you prefer them to be perfect, slender, gorgeous, and supremely self-confident? Or do you prefer them to have some flaws and feel self-conscious in some situations. Sexually active or more discerning? Financially successful or struggling in an ordinary job to make ends meet? Sexy underwear or plain? What types of heroines appeal to you? Come share your thoughts with Catherine Anderson, Cathy Maxwell, J L Wilson, Julie James, Sally MacKenzie, Susan Donovan.\n\nOf course, I'll be around throughout the conference, attending panels/workshops, the awards ceremony (psst–Practice Makes Perfect was nominated for Best Contemporary) and other events, but those are the places you can find me for sure.\n\nHeh…we overlapped down at Disney. Just returned home this morning and I am beat. Wish I was going to RomCon – hoped to make it but the vacation allotment's already taken a substantial hit. Maybe next time.\n\n:::sigh::: We love Disney World. Best place on Earth. We own DVC and still can't get enough. We did change it up and go to Disneyland this year for the first time, but we're itching to go back to the World. We do, however, only go during off seasons. Can't imagine being there now!\n\nI'm a new fan who loves your books – especially the leading legal ladies! I laughed at this blog entry almost as much as the Austen-spouting Chicago cabdriver you created – my five year old's favorite part of Disneyland is that he could get a \"prize\" at the end of every ride. Clever Disney marketing, I suppose, but it led to several less than happiest place on earth moments when he failed to win his prize at every gift shop.", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "7571e51b-0b5e-409e-993c-c08fe88c8ab8", "url": "https://juliejames.com/2010/07/where-ive-been-and-where-ill-be-at-romcon/"}
