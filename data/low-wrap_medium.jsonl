{"text": "If you are an avid boxing enthusiast who frequently visits boxing websites, you have likely encountered rumors about a former Filipino sparring partner of Manny Pacquiao who, preferring anonymity, alleges to have personally administered an illicit substance into Pacquiao's gluteal region. This unnamed former team member also claims that these injections began prior to Pacquiao's fight against Oscar de la Hoya.\n\nUpon returning from an eight-day journey to Dipolog and Dapitan, I observed that my daughter Jana, participating in the Palarong Pambansa for the first time, won four out of her five singles matches and contributed to our Region VII securing a tennis bronze medal. Reflecting on this trip, I realized, upon landing in Mactan and traversing the Marcelo B. Fernan Bridge while admiring Cebu's mountainous and coastal landscape, that our own city is unparalleled in the Philippines. While Manila is bustling but polluted, Dapitan and Dipolog, at the other extreme, offer a lifestyle that is perhaps too laid-back.\n\nIn the 2011 Palarong Pambansa held in Dapitan City, the Davao Region Lady Eagles demonstrated superior skills and teamwork to clinch the gold medal in the revived secondary girls basketball event, while their male counterparts placed seventh overall. The team's captain, Niña Beatriz Gonzales of the Assumption College of Davao, commended her teammates for their victory.\n\nTo commence its annual golf tournaments, leading electronics firm Samsung will host the National Tournament of Club Champions from May 24 to 28 at the expansive Eagle Ridge Golf and Country Club in Gen. Trias, Cavite.\n\nThe tournament, in its sixth iteration, assembles the defending men's, ladies, and seniors club champions from at least 24 golf clubs nationwide, hailing from as far north as Baguio Country Club and Camp John Hay, and as far south as Rancho Palos Verdes in Davao.\n\nAmerican Berry Henson led the charge in a grueling back-nine test at Wack Wack's East Course, carding a resilient one-under par 71, and opening up a two-stroke advantage over Filipino Jay Bayron and South African Jbe Kruger in the third round of the $300,000 ICTSI-Philippine Open on Saturday. Henson's birdies on three of the first 13 holes helped mitigate a late stumble, which was almost par for the course given the challenging layout that separated the serious contenders from the rest.\n\nIn the ongoing 2011 Palarong Pambansa in Dapitan City, Taekwondo maintained the Cordillera Region's winning streak, securing the overall championship in the elementary girls division. Following a triumph in the poomsae event, the region added another gold medal to its tally, courtesy of Aitana Fias-ilon in the kyorugi group 3 event, while Karina Abul claimed silver in the group 1 action.\n\nThe region's top arnis practitioners are gearing up to showcase their skills once again at the Enersel Forte National Youth Arnis Festival, scheduled for this weekend at the SM Megamall Activity Center. Approximately 300 competitors from across the country are expected to participate in the two-day event, backed by the Cebu City Sports Commission, Cacoy Doce Pares World Federation, and the Davao City Sports Committee, serving as a precursor to the World Arnis Open (WAO) in October.\n\nIn Manila, Baguio's formidable taekwondo alliance, comprising the Baguio Defenders Do Jang (BDDJ), Ultimate Fitness Center (UFC), and Bravehearts Gym, turned the Rizal Memorial Coliseum into a veritable 'arena of agony' on May 1, securing a majority of the individual gold medals at the 2011 Smart New Face Taekwondo Championships. The intimidating athletes from these gyms further solidified Baguio's taekwondo dominance with their high-energy performances across elementary, high school, and seniors' categories.\n\nMeanwhile, the Ceres-Negros Team, coached by Norman Fegidero Jr., is poised to secure their finals spot in the Philippine Football Federation Suzuki Under-23 National Cup. With a record of 5 wins, 1 draw, and 0 losses, they face off against Mindanao's top team and Group B's second-placed Davao Football Association (FA) in the cross-over semifinals, to be held in Barotac Nuevo, Iloilo City.\n\nIn Dapitan City, 17-year-old Maika De Oro, an incoming college student, broke her own secondary girls' discus throw record at the 2011 Palarong Pambansa. With a throw of 40.25 meters in her fifth attempt, she surpassed her previous record of 36.01 meters set in the Tarlac Palaro the year before.\n\nIn the same event, the Western Visayas secondary team, represented by Domingo Lacson National High School, clinched their 16th title after defeating the defending champions from the National Capital Region (NCR), 3-2, in the Secondary Girls' Softball finals held at the Galas Open Field in Dapitan City.\n\nIn the 2011 Palarong Pambansa, Northern Mindanao, coached by Tony Oquindo, redeemed their 4-3 defeat from the previous year's finals against NCR, halfway through their taekwondo and volleyball medal campaigns. With the elementary boys' volleyball team threatening to reach the finals, Northern Mindanao appeared poised to surpass their nine-gold medal tally and aim for a top-4 finish by the tournament's conclusion on Saturday at the Jose Rizal Memorial Sports Complex in Dipolog City.\n\nIn Digos City, the diminutive Mae Barit secured two more gold medals in the 2011 Palarong Pambansa athletics competition, held at the Jose Rizal Memorial State University (JRMSU) sports complex in Dapitan City on Friday. This feat made her the most decorated Davao Region athlete, with a total of three gold medals.\n\nIn the 2011 Palarong Pambansa arnis competition, which concluded at the Rizal Memorial Institute in Dapitan City on Thursday night, Davao Region amassed a total of two gold medals, two silvers, and five bronzes.\n\nDespite not matching last year's record-breaking performance, Region 7's overall performance in the 2011 Palarong Pambansa was actually improved. According to DepEd 7 official Danilo Villadolid, \"This time last year, many athletes had already returned home due to early eliminations. This year, it's different. I am quite confident that we will have a better outcome this year.\"\n\nAt the close of the 5th Cebu Schools Athletic Foundation Inc. Partners' Cup elimination round at the Cebu Coliseum, the Southwestern University Cobras-San Marino Corned Tuna saw their four-game winning streak come to an end, while the Winners Beef Loaf-Cebu Institute of Technology-University Wildcats concluded their campaign on a positive note.\n\nFollowing the triumph of its inaugural edition, which comprised various sporting events and a successful record attempt, the Cebu Festival's second iteration aims to amplify the sporting activities, thereby doubling the enjoyment and exhilaration for both athletes and sports aficionados. This array of diverse sports events will commence with the Sundown Run, scheduled to take place today at the South Road Properties.\n\nIn anticipation of the impending 1st Asian Beach Volleyball Championship (ABVC), the University of Southern Philippines Foundation (USPF) is sending its Lady Panthers to participate in this weekend's Vallehermoso Negros Oriental Beach Volleyball Invitational Tournament. Post this event, the team will proceed to the Philippine National Games (PNG) in Bacolod City, slated from May 22 to 29. USPF's Erika Verano and Apple Araum, accompanied by the University of the Visayas men's team, will engage with Negros' top players in these tournaments as part of their preparation for the ABVC.", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "848dea90-8474-47b9-ba41-992ef973ada0", "url": "http://www.sunstar.com.ph/sports?page=375"}
{"text": "Two queries, if you please. Firstly, do you have a predilection for soaps or creams, or do you appreciate both? Could you elucidate your reasoning?\nSecondly, could you enumerate your preferred soaps and/or creams?\nFor myself, I find merit in both, with no strong preference. In haste, I might opt for a cream due to its swift lathering. While I possess several favorites, I currently enjoy all in my collection, having discarded one that failed to meet my expectations. I remain open to exploration, with a few standouts thus far.\nI've observed that creams generally provide a robust lather with various water types. Soaps, however, can pose a challenge with hard water.\nGiven my hard water, I've found that Mitchell's Wool Fat, Arko, Ogallala, Mama Bear, Tabac, and Colonel Conk's all produce excellent lathers, given sufficient time to build up soap on the brush - around a minute seems adequate for me.\nI do harbor an affection for creams. I believe tomorrow's shave might feature Cella or Speick.\nI must confess, I do not share the enthusiasm for shaving that many seem to possess. I find it a chore, but perhaps exploring new recommendations could spark some enjoyment. I've been using a Gillette Mach 3 with gel, but perhaps a switch could prove beneficial.\n\nThe Mach3, with its substantial size, was a significant contributing factor, if not the primary cause, of the ingrown hairs I experienced. Moreover, it was also a catalyst for my irritation issues, which were unrelated to the ingrown hairs. The reason for this was my tendency to press down too hard while shaving, in an attempt to ensure a close shave, and my reluctance to replace the blades as frequently as I should have, in an effort to maximize their lifespan.\n\nSince transitioning to wet shaving, I have not encountered any ingrown hairs. Initially, I did experience some irritation, but this subsided as I honed my technique, learning to maintain the correct angle and avoid applying too much pressure.\n\nI would strongly recommend that you consider investing in a beginner's kit and exploring the world of wet shaving. It has, in my experience, proven to be a more comfortable and effective method of shaving.", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "6e91caa5-4ed6-4d9d-9b40-0c20e777bf43", "url": "http://www.cigarasylum.com/vb/showthread.php?t=54545"}

{"text": "Stay informed with the latest Redskins updates!\nThe 2009 season's conclusion on December 28, in San Francisco, marked the onset of the dreaded off-season, a period that starkly revealed our team's shortcomings. Despite a promising 6-2 start, which had many predicting a playoff berth, our 2-6 finish was a bitter pill to swallow. The early loss to St. Louis, compounded by Pete Kendall's infamous fumble that resulted in a Rams touchdown just before halftime, was particularly hard to stomach. The latter half of the season saw us unexpectedly succumb to teams like Cincinnati and San Francisco, our offensive line struggle, and our passing game falter. Thus, we entered the off-season with more queries than resolutions.\n\nHowever, the off-season brought some positives, notably the acquisition of free agent standout Albert Haynesworth and the addition of talented defensive player Brian Orakpo to bolster our pass rush. Philip Daniels returned to health, and DeAngelo Hall committed to D.C. for the long term. There's no need to dwell on the past, though.\n\nJim Zorn appears more at ease on the sidelines these days, his offense having had time to gel with our offensive weapons.

{"text": "Presently, I am offering a 2000 BMW 540i, equipped with a V8 engine and 205,000 miles on the odometer. This vehicle, finished in Black Pearl, features a 6-speed manual transmission and the coveted M package. It is comprehensively optioned, including a fully functional navigation system and a moonroof. The car performs exceptionally well on the road, and I have greatly enjoyed driving it. Having recently acquired the vehicle, I have invested some time in its upkeep. Mechanically, it is in sound condition, with no significant issues; it required a thorough cleaning, and the navigation system, which was initially inoperable, has been restored to functionality using a used replacement computer and head unit. The head unit bears minor cosmetic damage on its screen, but this does not impair its functionality. The exterior has been meticulously cleaned, polished, and waxed, resulting in a lustrous finish with minimal dents or marks. The interior, likewise, is in excellent condition, with no visible cuts or stains, save for a rear window that descends only an inch. This issue is not believed to be major and is yet to be addressed. The tires and brake pads are nearly new, and a leak in the power steering lines has been repaired, with only minor seepage remaining. The oil, recently changed, was in good condition. The wheels, previously showing signs of clear coat flaking, have been repainted black. Additionally, the windows have been tinted, an OEM M5 spoiler has been installed, and the exhaust has been customized for a straight pipe configuration from the catalytic converters back, resulting in an impressive sound that attracts attention.\n\nThe brevity of ownership for this vehicle, despite its appealing nature, is attributable to an unexpected financial predicament. Initially acquired as a supplementary automobile for leisure, the current fiscal constraints have rendered its retention impractical. Its tenure as a source of enjoyment was indeed fleeting.\n\nYou are invited to inspect and test-drive the car, an experience that will likely surpass your expectations given its mileage of just over 200,000. The dealership from which it was purchased had maintained the vehicle for the previous owner over the past 100,000 miles, before they traded it in for a newer model. Test drives will be conducted only with serious buyers prepared to negotiate, accompanied by the necessary funds.\n\nI am in possession of the clear title and can provide additional photographs upon request, including specific details as per your requirements. The original owner's manuals and window sticker, which listed the car new for $60,000 in the year 2000, will also be made available. A clean Carfax report, devoid of any accident history, further attests to the vehicle's integrity.\n\nWhile Santa Claus traditionally relies on his reindeer, with or without Rudolph, to traverse the globe on Christmas Eve, in the southern California region, he appears to have swapped his sleigh for high-performance motorcycles. Normally, one might expect to find thrilling motorcycle stunts on video at RNickeyMouse, particularly along the winding Mulholland Drive in Los Angeles. However, a recent clip captured an unusual sight: three Santas, riding a BMW S1000RR, a Yamaha R1, and what seems to be a customized Ducati 1098, navigating the iconic road together. A bonus Santa, riding solo on another S1000RR, also made an appearance. In the spirit of the season, we wish everyone a Merry Christmas and a cool ride!\n\nIn automotive news, BMW has found an innovative use for Gorilla Glass, typically associated with smartphones. Instead of replacing windshields, as initially thought, the material will be employed in the i8's rear window for sound insulation purposes. According to Autoweek and Autoevolution, the glass will remain laminated, with two 0.7mm layers sandwiching an acoustic sheet. To achieve its target weight of less than 3,285 pounds for the i8, BMW has incorporated lightweight materials not typically used in mass-produced vehicles. The use of a carbon fiber reinforced plastic (CFRP) monocoque in both the i3 and i8 is a testament to BMW's commitment to innovation.

{"text": "In a recent New York Times op-ed, James Franco, the versatile artist and intellectual, weighed in on the eccentric antics of Shia LaBeouf. These included LaBeouf's plagiarism of Daniel Clowes' work, his subsequent plagiarized apologies, and his peculiar public displays, such as wearing a paper bag with 'I AM NOT FAMOUS ANYMORE' inscribed. Franco's piece appeared to be a narrow defense of male actor privilege, as actresses seldom engage in such behavior without facing severe career repercussions. Even when they do, their male counterparts rarely receive the same level of leniency or attention.\n\nOn 17 December 2013, at 16:30:47 UTC, Jacob Hall reported that an artist's cardinal sin is to pilfer from another without proper acknowledgment. This transgression seemed to elude Shia LaBeouf, who premiered a short film he directed, only to face allegations of plagiarism. The term \"allegations\" is somewhat lenient, given the evident lifting of dialogue and shots from another source, which LaBeouf neglected to credit in the film's credits.\n\nOn 10 October 2013, at 13:43:29 UTC, Nick Romano discussed Lars von Trier's 'Nymphomaniac', a film whose title alone hints at its provocative nature. LaBeouf's announcement that he would engage in on-camera sexual acts for the film further underscores its controversial status. Recently released posters for the film, numbering 14, make no effort to tone down its explicit content, serving as a preparation for viewers.\n\nOn 23 April 2013, at 19:02:41 UTC, Jacob Hall announced that LaBeouf, known for his collaborations with icons, is set to join Brad Pitt in the upcoming World War II film 'Fury'. This follows his previous collaborations with Harrison Ford in the last Indiana Jones film and his attachment to 'Spy's Kid' with Robert De Niro.\n\nAmong the peculiar cinematic duos of fathers and sons, few are as unusual as Robert De Niro and Shia LaBeouf. Despite their distinct personas, they are both set to star in 'Spy's Kid', a film based on the true account of a spy who exploited his son's innocence to continue his clandestine activities from prison.\n\nIn another vein, 'The Company You Keep', directed by the renowned liberal filmmaker Robert Redford, delves into the controversial legacy of the Weather Underground, a radical anti-Vietnam youth movement. Known for its grand rhetoric and acts of domestic terrorism, the group's true nature is often misconstrued in film, with even Redford's portrayal potentially veering towards sensationalism. In reality, however, the group was more cautious, warning of impending bombings and suffering no casualties beyond a tragic explosives accident in a Greenwich Village apartment.\n\nOn 13 February 2013, at 21:30:38 GMT, Britt Hayes reported the release of a new trailer for 'The Company You Keep', a film featuring an extensive ensemble cast including Shia LaBeouf, Susan Sarandon, and Robert Redford. LaBeouf's performance, notably characterized by his use of smart-person glasses, was deemed convincing by Hayes.\n\nIn an earlier report on 31 August 2012, at 00:30:14 GMT, Hayes detailed LaBeouf's unconventional approach to acting. The actor had previously admitted to using hallucinogenic drugs as part of his method acting for a role, and later revealed that he had sent sex tapes to Lars von Trier in an attempt to secure a part in 'Nymphomaniac'.\n\nOn 30 August 2012, at 18:27:20 GMT, Eric Walkuski announced the premiere of a trailer for 'The Company You Keep', a thriller directed by and starring Robert Redford. The film, boasting an impressive cast, had begun its festival circuit at Venice and was set to continue at Toronto. Walkuski presented the trailer, suggesting that the film could be a strong contender for awards during the upcoming season.\n\n\"2012 has been a year marked by notable unconventional performances. Matthew McConaughey's role in 'Magic Mike' and Michael Shannon's in 'Premium Rush' are standouts, but the recipient of this year's Walken/Cage award for eccentricity is arguably Tom Hardy. His portrayal of the masked revolutionary Bane in 'The Dark Knight Rises' and the unyielding Forrest Bondurant in John Hillcoat's 'Lawless' have delivered two robust, visceral performances that are sure to inspire impressions for years to come.\"\n\n\"In a bid to project a tough image, Shia LaBeouf has been making strides. Following his provocative music video, he has secured a role in the upcoming action film 'Lawless'. While the official trailer offered a glimpse of LaBeouf alongside 'Dark Knight' alumni Gary Oldman and Tom Hardy, The Weinstein Company has recently released seven new character posters that provide a closer look at how LaBeouf intends to embody his new role.\"\n\nOn 6 July 2012, at 23:04:57 GMT, George Roush reported on a quote from the second trailer of the forthcoming action-drama 'Lawless', starring Tom Hardy, Shia LaBeouf, and Guy Pearce. The line, \"It is not the violence that sets men apart. It is the distance that he is prepared to go,\" underscores the film's intense tone. The trailer's impact is further amplified by an infographic displaying the characters' arsenal, leaving no doubt about their seriousness.\n\nEarlier, on 18 June 2012, at 16:03:33 GMT, Mike Sampson discussed Shia LaBeouf's recent activities. After a string of less-than-stellar films, such as 'Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull' and the 'Transformers' series, LaBeouf seems to be embracing his personal interests in 2012. This includes selling self-published comics at a local convention and appearing nude in a Sigur Rós music video.\n\nIn a separate report on 22 May 2012, at 04:55:06 GMT, George Roush highlighted Tom Hardy's upcoming roles. Hardy is set to portray Bane in 'The Dark Knight Rises' and will later star as a bootlegger in 'Lawless', alongside LaBeouf and Pearce. 'Lawless' is scheduled for release on 29 August 2012.\n\nDamon Houx, on 25 April 2012, at 00:43:00 GMT, shared details about the 'Lawless' trailer. The film, set during Prohibition, features Hardy, LaBeouf, and Pearce as bootleggers, with Hardy's character, Forrest Bondurant, leading the operation. The trailer offers a glimpse into the brothers' illicit activities and the violence they face from rival gangsters.\n\nAt the recent Chicago Comic and Entertainment Expo (C2E2), a bearded, long-haired individual was spotted hawking his self-published literary works, leaving attendees curious about his identity and the apparent disdain he displayed for the prominent 'Transformers' exhibits.", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "ba861725-4437-49fa-b949-3840aa5d00cc", "url": "http://screencrush.com/tags/shia-labeouf/feed/"}

{"text": "The website Yaya-Toure.com serves as a dedicated fan platform for Côte d'Ivoire's professional footballer, Yaya Touré, currently playing for the English Premier League's Manchester City. The site's main menu and post navigation sections provide updates on Touré and his team.\n\nManchester City's central defender, Vincent Kompany, was absent from the 2-2 draw against Queens Park Rangers (QPR) and missed both of Belgium's international fixtures due to a calf strain. Meanwhile, Frank Lampard, who had been nursing a minor injury, was fit enough to appear as a substitute against QPR.\n\nManager Manuel Pellegrini confirmed in a Friday press conference that Kompany has recovered and is available for the Premier League clash against Swansea City at the Etihad Stadium on Saturday. Pellegrini also stated that Lampard is in contention for the match, although midfielder David Silva, and forwards Edin Dzeko and Aleksandar Kolarov are all sidelined due to injuries.\n\nCity has experienced a dip in form recently, winning only once in their last six matches across all competitions. Pellegrini hopes that Saturday's match will signal a turnaround in their fortunes. \"I hope we can return to our normal form now that the international break is over,\" he said, adding that Swansea City, known for their technical prowess, will pose a significant challenge.\n\nDuring the international break, Touré's performances with Côte d'Ivoire helped secure qualification for the 2017 Africa Cup of Nations. Pellegrini expressed his happiness for Touré but acknowledged that City will be without his services during the tournament in January and February.\n\n\"While we'll certainly miss Yaya Toure in the New Year, we'll wait until December to determine how we'll address his absence.\"\n\nThe Ivory Coast national has left open the possibility of joining a major club, despite his current team's poor form, which he attributes to post-World Cup exhaustion.\n\nYaya Toure, Manchester City's midfielder, has not dismissed rumors of a potential move to Paris Saint-Germain, with his agent Dimitri Seluk previously suggesting discontent at the Etihad Stadium.\n\nWhen asked about a potential transfer to PSG, Toure told RMC, \"We don't know what the future holds. My focus is on continuing my work here. You never know what opportunities may arise tomorrow. Playing for big clubs and winning titles is always a goal, but one must also continue to learn and grow.\"\n\nToure's subpar performance this season, compared to his 2013-14 campaign, has contributed to City's slow start, leaving them eight points behind league leaders Chelsea after just 11 matches.\n\nHowever, Toure believes that the physical demands of the World Cup, with many of his teammates also participating, have left the team fatigued and struggling to perform at their peak.\n\nIn defense of teammate Samir Nasri, Toure stated, \"Many factors contribute to our current situation. The intense physical workload last year has taken its toll. When you consider that almost the entire squad played in the World Cup, it's understandable that we're feeling the effects.\"\n\nThe 27-year-old player, following his exclusion from the national team's World Cup squad, had declared himself unavailable for future matches of Les Bleus, a decision that Toure, a teammate, did not think should attract undue criticism. \"Samir is a kind-hearted individual, like a brother to me,\" Toure asserted, \"His love for his country is evident, even in his somewhat awkward public apology to the fans, which was a testament to his positive nature.\"\n\nThis season, the 31-year-old Toure has faced criticism due to perceived subpar performances, with reports suggesting unhappiness stemming from the club's handling of his brother Ibrahim's passing. His red card during the club's 2-1 loss to CSKA Moscow in midweek further fueled the criticism. However, Manchester City's Chilean manager, Pellegrini, maintains Toure's significance to the team, stating, \"There are many rumors about Yaya's potential sale, but within the club, we are not discussing such matters. Yaya remains a crucial player for us.\"\n\nPellegrini also confirmed that Vincent Kompany, the team's central defender, would miss the upcoming match against QPR due to a calf injury, and his participation in Belgium's international fixtures later in the week is uncertain. Despite the injury not being severe, Pellegrini admitted, \"I don't know if he'll be ready for his national team duties.\"\n\nWhile Kompany, David Silva, and Aleksander Kolarov are set to miss the QPR match, Pellegrini expressed optimism about Frank Lampard's potential return. The former Chelsea midfielder, who was stretchered off during a match against Tottenham on October 18, could make a comeback and recapture the form that saw him score four goals in three games prior to his injury layoff.\n\n\"Having recently recovered from an injury, there are hopes that he will regain his former prowess,\" he remarked. The Ivorian atoned for an earlier mistake by scoring a brilliant free-kick for CSKA Moscow's opening goal, but later tarnished his image by pushing Roman Eremenko in the second half. Yaya Touré has since expressed remorse to Manchester City's fans for his dismissal during their surprising home loss to CSKA Moscow in the Champions League. Two goals from Seydou Doumbia secured the Russians their maiden victory on English soil, while Fernandinho accumulated two yellow cards and Touré was sent off for a petulant push on Roman Eremenko. This defeat leaves winless City at the foot of Group E and on the verge of another embarrassing Champions League exit, with upcoming matches against Bayern Munich and Roma. The final whistle at the Etihad Stadium was met with jeers, and subsequently, a contrite Touré took to Twitter to convey his sorrow for his actions. \"City fans – I am sorry for my red card. I believe it is crucial to apologise for this,\" he tweeted. Fernandinho also conveyed his regret, apologising to his teammates and supporters for his two yellow cards and underwhelming performance. \"I feel very sad about the result and my dismissal tonight. I want to apologise to my teammates and fans for the red card. Sorry,\" he posted. Touré's apology comes a day after he received racist abuse on the social networking site, prompting an investigation by Greater Manchester Police. EXCLUSIVE: The Ivory Coast midfielder asserts that the Premier League champions must advance further in the UEFA Champions League to achieve the next level of growth as a club.\n\nShould Manchester City falter against CSKA Moscow, no one would be more disheartened than Yaya Touré. Another poor result would all but extinguish City's UEFA Champions League aspirations for the third time in four seasons. Touré, who triumphed with Barcelona in 2009, is eager to see his current club emulate his former side's European success. He believes that City must demonstrate their true potential in their remaining group matches against CSKA, Bayern Munich, and Roma. In an exclusive interview with Goal, Touré expressed his desire for City to compete at the highest level in the Champions League, stating, \"It's the most prestigious tournament in Europe. If we aim to contend with the best, we must do so this year.\" City's history in the Champions League has been marked by early exits, with their only advancement beyond the group stage occurring in their inaugural season. They have since fallen short against Barcelona and other formidable opponents. Touré has called for City to make their mark in Europe, as they have done in the English Premier League.\n\nThe club's expansion has been robust, and it is poised for continued growth,\" he remarked. \"Once a compact unit, the team has since swelled in size, and the newly established training facility is nothing short of remarkable.\" Toure, at 31, dismissed recent critiques of his performance, particularly following the 1-0 loss to Bayern Munich and the 2-2 draw in Moscow. Instead, he let his play on the pitch speak for him during the Manchester derby. \"I am a man driven by ambition,\" he stated. \"I continually strive for excellence and, currently, Manchester City presents a commendable platform for achieving significant milestones.\" Although Toure, with over 50 Champions League appearances under his belt for Olympiakos, Barcelona, and City, acknowledged that some of his teammates lacked experience in the competition, he remained confident in the squad's capabilities ahead of tonight's crucial match. \"Some of them are indeed young,\" he noted. \"The pressure of performing at such a high level can be immense, and for those without prior experience in the Champions League's latter stages, it can sometimes erode confidence. However, I am confident in our squad's potential, and I am entirely optimistic about our prospects.", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "d4f04a9c-0ab7-4932-a0f2-b2ec7bf53d53", "url": "http://www.yaya-toure.com/"}

Meanwhile, America's self-proclaimed 'Best Christian,' Mrs. Betty Bowers, is 'taking Halloween back - for Christ,' a move that has been met with mixed reactions.

{"text": "Serenic Corporation, a global software developer specializing in integrated financial management and human capital management solutions for non-profit organizations, government agencies, and Microsoft Dynamics NAV users, has announced the impending sale of its subsidiaries and disclosed its financial performance for the three months and year ended February 28, 2014. The transaction, subject to shareholder approval at the upcoming Annual General and Special Meeting on July 22, 2014, and other customary closing conditions, involves the acquisition of Serenic's operating companies by Sylogist. For comprehensive details, please refer to the press release titled 'Sylogist to Acquire Serenic Operating Companies' filed on SEDAR.\n\nPost-acquisition, Serenic plans to rebrand and establish a new operating division, 'Cloudco', which will retain the intellectual property associated with Serenic's cloud technology. Sylogist will grant Cloudco an OEM license for certain products, enabling it to rebrand and market these solutions to new customer segments. Both parties aim to collaborate non-competitively to explore and penetrate new volume markets, thereby benefiting each other.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA, which stands for earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, stock option expense, and impairment provisions, is detailed in the Serenic Management Discussion and Analysis (MD&A) for the periods ended February 28, 2014. In reviewing Serenic's fiscal 2014, while the business operated as a single entity, management finds it beneficial to assess financials from the perspective of divisional profit centers, a method adopted in fiscal 2015 for performance evaluation and resource allocation.\n\nSerenic has restructured its operations into three profit-center business units for fiscal 2015:\n\n1. The NFP unit, offering on-premise perpetual license solutions tailored for mid to large enterprise-level not-for-profit and certain public sector organizations.\n2. The HCM unit, providing on-premise human capital management license products to small and medium businesses (SMBs) across not-for-profit, public sector, and for-profit sectors.\n3. The 'Cloud' unit, developing SaaS (Software as a Service) versions of Serenic's software solutions, aligning with Microsoft's volume and Cloud strategies.\n\nNotably, Serenic's Cloud division has engineered technology enabling Microsoft's Dynamics NAV ERP and CRM applications to function on Azure, Microsoft's Cloud platform. This technology facilitates browser-based access to applications, eliminating the need for local installation. Serenic's Cloud solutions can integrate with Microsoft Office 365 and other cloud products.\n\nWhile the Non-Financial Products (NFP) and Human Capital Management (HCM) divisions are established entities expected to maintain profitability, the Cloud division is still in its pre-revenue phase and will incur operating losses until subscription fees from new customers for its products surpass the expenses funded by the Company's cash. Both mature divisions currently derive more than 50% of their revenues from recurring software maintenance contracts, which customers purchase to access software updates and associated services. Although total revenue growth decreased by approximately 6% in Fiscal 2014 compared to the previous year, the compound annual revenue growth rate over the past eight years remains positive, suggesting a growing business.\n\nThe following table presents the financial outcomes of the Company's three business units in Fiscal 2014, adopting the perspective of divisional business units, a metric that will be used in Fiscal 2015 and was not previously employed by management for performance measurement and resource allocation.\n\nThe legacy HCM and NFP divisions contributed positively to the overall financial results. Revenue was generated from these divisions by increasing the addition of new customers and providing updates, maintenance, and support services to the existing customer base. Recurring revenue from these customers accounted for more than half of the gross revenue recorded in Fiscal 2014. However, the Company's substantial investment in the Cloud project during Fiscal 2014 significantly reduced EBITDA and earnings, culminating in the recorded loss for the year.\n\nIn the fiscal year just concluded, Serenic's earnings amounted to $11,333,123, marking a 6% decrease from the $12,071,865 recorded in Fiscal 2013. Gross profits stood at $7,325,991, down from $8,209,696 in the preceding year, largely due to a dip in license sales revenue through Serenic's reseller partner network. Notably, sales of Human Capital Management (HCM) licenses surged by 22.7%, buoyed by steady demand for payroll and HCM products, including the new advanced HRIS solution.\n\nA strategic initiative was undertaken during the year to integrate an OEM-licensed HRIS solution with Serenic's payroll products, aiming for a full market release in June 2014, benefiting both Serenic Navigator and Dynamics NAV users.\n\nWhile revenue from Cloud products was negligible during the year, Serenic began promoting its Cloud solutions through various webinars, which, according to management, drew substantial interest. The sales team successfully closed the first sale of a prescriptive version of Serenic Navigator, employing a fixed-price, streamlined methodology - a departure from Serenic's traditional highly consultative sales approach, and a move seen as crucial for competing in the Small and Medium-sized Business (SMB) market.\n\nThe first of the new Cloud ERP products, Navigator Express, was launched in December 2013. This entry-level solution allows potential customers to initiate a trial installation on an Azure cloud server, import their financial records, and ultimately purchase the product, all with minimal interaction with Serenic personnel.\n\nIn the fiscal year 2014, the Company booked a non-cash impairment charge of $421,376 for certain intellectual properties, and it capitalized $169,257 less in costs compared to the previous fiscal year. These costs were associated with the restructuring to operate as distinct business units in fiscal 2015, including personnel cuts, hiring independent vendors for cloud initiatives, and legal fees. Consequently, the Company's gross profit decreased, and expenses increased, leading to a net loss of $2,048,306 in fiscal 2014, a stark contrast to the net income of $39,110 in the prior year.\n\nThe management team continued to evaluate strategic corporate options with the aim of potentially enhancing and unlocking shareholder value. During the year, the Company repurchased and canceled 536,500 of its shares under its Normal Course Issuer Bid.\n\nAs of February 28, 2014, the Company's cash resources stood at $3,318,602, a decrease of $1,013,976 from the $4,332,578 recorded as of February 28, 2013. The significant net loss was the primary factor contributing to this reduction in cash. Despite this, management expressed confidence that the Company's cash resources remained sufficient to support its planned operations.\n\nDuring the quarter, the company's total revenue amounted to $2.9 million, marking a 26.8% decline from the $3.9 million recorded in the corresponding quarter of the previous year. This downturn was primarily attributable to a significant software license sale in Q4 2013, which was not replicated in the current fiscal year, resulting in a $1.3 million decrease. Human Capital Management (HCM) license sales, however, remained steady compared to the previous year. The services revenue segment experienced a $100,000 increase, or 15.1%, driven by HRIS system implementations, Total Care Plan amortization, and a rise in Software as a Service (SaaS) or cloud monthly fees. Additionally, software maintenance contract revenue surged by 13.9% to $200,000, bolstered by high renewal rates among existing customers and the addition of new clients. The strengthening U.S. dollar also contributed to an approximate $206,000 increase in revenues.\n\nThe quarter witnessed a $996,224 decrease in gross profit, largely due to the decline in software license revenues and their associated gross margins. Total expenses rose by $822,990, or 39.5%. A non-cash impairment charge of $421,376 was incurred during the quarter, stemming from the write-down in value of internally generated software. The appreciation of the U.S. dollar further increased this cost category by approximately $114,000. Towards the end of the year, as the company implemented its Fiscal 2015 strategies, it reduced its workforce and accrued a severance provision. Incentive pay experienced a sharp decline during the period, while sales and marketing costs remained stable on a quarter-over-quarter basis.\n\nDue to a decline in sales and gross profit, escalating expenses, and a non-cash impairment charge, the net income of $575,636 in the fourth quarter of 2013 was replaced by a net loss of $1,158,329 in the current quarter. Consequently, Adjusted EBITDA plummeted by $1,378,295, directly attributed to the net loss incurred this quarter.\n\nFORWARD LOOK (CONDEMNDED ON THE CLOSURE OF SERENIC SUBSIDIARIES SALE)\nFor Fiscal 2015, Serenic's operational teams have been restructured into the legacy NFP and HCM business units, aiming to optimize their financial performance and secure adequate funding for the development of the Cloud unit. Despite continued investment in Cloud, management and the board anticipate a significant improvement in financial performance and EBITDA contribution on a consolidated basis during Fiscal 2015. The legacy business units have been streamlined for enhanced efficiency and profitability, and with the foundational work in the Cloud division completed, increased revenue generation from the Cloud division is expected in the latter part of Fiscal 2015, which is anticipated to mitigate the losses incurred by the Cloud project.\n\nSerenic will continue to cultivate and expand its traditional niche market customers by offering enhanced versions of historical products to those organizations preferring on-premise perpetual license solutions. Simultaneously, it will provide a transition path to the SaaS world for those NFP and HCM customers choosing to migrate to Cloud-deployed solutions. Additionally, Serenic intends to explore new volume niche markets that are now accessible with its new Cloud products, employing strategies such as Click-Try-Buy and other volume-enabling features.\n\nPotential Cloud Opportunities: Serenic is exploring further prospects with Cloud, such as licensing its underlying Cloud technology to other Dynamics NAV vendors seeking to migrate their ERP solutions to Microsoft's Cloud. This could generate additional revenue streams. Serenic's long-standing, advantageous partnership with Microsoft has seen investments of over $3 million, providing a competitive edge. This strategic move is deemed challenging for smaller software companies to replicate, especially those not already committed to cloud migration.\n\nProduct Expansion: Serenic is broadening its product suite through collaborations with other vendors, including a U.S.-based organization specializing in donor management for faith-based groups. These partnerships, including the donor management application and HRIS offering, have shown promising results in fiscal 2014 and are expected to drive future revenue growth.\n\nCorporate Development: Serenic's management believes the company's market capitalization and share price do not accurately reflect its intrinsic value, given the strength of its mature software divisions, loyal customer base, high recurring revenue, and technological leadership in Cloud for Dynamics NAV products. If the planned sale of subsidiaries does not materialize, management will continue to evaluate and pursue alternatives to maximize shareholder value.\n\nFinancial Information: Interested parties are encouraged to review Serenic's audited consolidated financial statements and management's discussion and analysis for the year ended February 28, 2014, available on Sedar.com.\n\nAbout Serenic Corporation: Serenic, headquartered in Colorado with staff across Canada, England, Africa, and the USA, develops mission-critical software for not-for-profit organizations.\n\nDwayne Kushniruk, in his capacity as Chairman, presents the following statements that offer insights into Serenic's future prospects, in accordance with relevant securities laws. These forward-looking statements discuss the company's products, their potential advantages, and the impending sale of certain subsidiaries. It is crucial to note that these statements are subject to inherent risks, uncertainties, assumptions, and other factors that could cause actual outcomes to significantly diverge from the expected results, performance, or achievements implied by such statements.

{"text": "Since its inception in 2004, the cheese shop has been steadfastly operating at 2945 N. Broadway, sharing the same building. The proprietors of Pastoral have announced plans for a new bistro adjacent to the store, offering a diverse menu that will include both hot and cold dishes, as well as lighter fare inspired by the cheese and charcuterie selections. The beverage program will feature innovative cocktails made with seasonal ingredients, along with a curated selection of hard-to-find wines and craft beers.\n\nThe ambiance of the new establishment, Bar Pastoral, is set to evoke a sense of tranquility, with soothing color palettes, exposed brick, and an eclectic mix of antiques sourced from near and far. The interior design will be helmed by Matt Nardella of Moss Design, who is also responsible for the aesthetic at the nearby 2 Sparrows brunch restaurant on Diversey Parkway.\n\nGreg O'Neill, co-owner of Pastoral, presented the concept for Bar Pastoral to the South East Lake View Neighbors Association at their recent meeting, receiving a positive reception, as indicated on the organization's Facebook page.\n\nCurrently, the storefront at 2947 N. Broadway houses Spare Parts, a boutique specializing in designer jewelry and handbags. This space is separated from Pastoral by an entry door leading to the upper-level apartments. The impact of Bar Pastoral's opening on Spare Parts remains unclear.\n\nBar Pastoral is one of several new businesses that have either recently opened or are set to open along Broadway, between Belmont Avenue and Diversey Parkway, with reactions from the community varying.\n\nIn other news, the World Market store is in the process of liquidation and is scheduled to close on June 17 to make way for a Wal-Mart. Following the closure, Wal-Mart plans to commence renovations and aims to open its doors early next year.\n\nIn December 2010, the proposed construction of a Wal-Mart sparked vehement opposition, with local residents expressing apprehension that it would displace the numerous small, independent stores along Broadway and Diversey Parkway, thereby altering the neighborhood's character for the worse. However, the current reality paints a different picture: independent businesses are flourishing along Broadway.\n\nNotably, Bar Pastoral is thriving, and another establishment, a craft beer-focused bar and bistro named Dryhop, is set to open in the fall just a short distance north. Dryhop will occupy the space at 3155 N. Broadway that has been vacant since 2006, when the Pleasure Chest adult store moved out. This upscale restaurant promises \"moderately priced and locally sourced cuisine inspired by the culinary techniques of Western Europe.\"\n\nNearby, at 3175 N. Broadway, the Los Angeles-based Laugh Factory comedy club has opened its Chicago outpost in the space previously occupied by the Lakeshore Theater, which closed in 2010. Meanwhile, Frog N Snail, a new restaurant, has recently opened at 3124 N. Broadway, taking over the location that was previously home to Sura, a Thai bistro known for its spherical swings.\n\nThe surge in new businesses along Broadway was initially led by the opening of a Hustler Hollywood adult store at 3161 N. Broadway last summer. This store occupies one of the two storefronts in the building where Dryhop is set to open, having replaced Reckless Records, which moved across the street a year earlier. Coincidentally, another adult store, Adult Fantasy at 2928 N. Broadway, closed a couple of blocks south last summer. This old-fashioned adult bookstore, which operated under various names since the 1970s, was a remnant of a seedier era.\n\nBeyond its iconic Broadway outlet, Pastoral cheese shop maintains additional locations: one at 53 East Lake Street in the heart of downtown Chicago, and another at 131 North Clinton Street, situated within the Chicago French Market. In a recent revelation on her WTTW-Channel 11 show 'Check Please,' Alpana Singh, the esteemed host, disclosed that she had been spending her time working as a cheesemonger at Pastoral, though she did not specify at which location.", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "3d553a78-07d4-42eb-a74e-708c050c805e", "url": "http://chicago.cbslocal.com/2012/05/17/pastoral-cheese-shop-to-open-concept-bistro-on-broadway/"}

{"text": "Our previous update on the Dutch supercar startup, Vencer, was over a year ago, when they revealed their solitary model, the Sarthe. Vencer has since announced that the official UK debut of the Sarthe will take place in early September at London's prestigious Salon Privé event.\n\nThe Sarthe, it seems, is poised to deliver an impressive supercar experience. Vencer has disclosed that the Sarthe will feature a tube steel and chrome-molybdenum chassis, reinforced by a honeycomb aluminum floor. According to Top Gear, a potent 510-horsepower Corvette V8 engine will be positioned behind the driver, mated to a six-speed manual transmission. Vencer claims that the car's carbon fiber bodywork helps to keep the weight to a mere 1,390 kilograms (approximately 3,064 pounds). This combination of light weight and high power enables the supercar to accelerate from 0-60 mph in just 3.8 seconds, with a top speed of 325 kilometers per hour (approximately 202 mph).\n\nStandard features on the Sarthe include air conditioning, electric windows and locks, an in-car entertainment system, an alarm, and ABS. However, customers can also opt for additional customizations.\n\nIn terms of production, Vencer has indicated that the Sarthe will be a low-volume model, with a limited number of units being produced. While pricing has not yet been announced, the London launch event promises English afternoon tea, champagne, and a lobster luncheon. It is safe to assume that these lavish touches will be reflected in the final price tag.", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "e1cb3f77-27d5-4d2d-9501-5d26adfe6a40", "url": "http://www.frenzycars.com/2013/06/14/official-220-mph-vencer-sarthe-supercar-to-be-revealed-at-salon-prive/"}

Our Select Support hosiery, with a control top design that contours thighs and hips, rivals physician-endorsed medical brands. With a moderate support level of 15-20 mm / Hg, these pantyhose offer balanced compression.\n\nCare Instructions & Details:\n- Machine washable in warm water on a gentle cycle, or handwash in warm water using a mild detergent.\n- Lay flat to dry.\n- Manufactured in the United States.\n\nUser Experiences:\n- A user found the pantyhose too snug and too long, causing bunching behind the knees and sagging at the ankles, leaving visible marks. Despite the attractive suntan color, the compression was deemed too tight, and they were difficult to put on and remove.\n- Another user, requiring support after a blood clot, found these pantyhose more comfortable than thigh-high alternatives for a 10-hour flight to Europe.\n- A male wearer praised their comfort, support, durability, and aesthetic when worn with shorts.\n- A user with circulatory issues, recommended by both their primary care physician and cardiologist to wear compression hose during waking hours, found these pantyhose to fit perfectly in size Q, despite their tall and heavy frame (6'1\", 220 lbs). Their wife approved, and they attracted no unwanted attention when worn with shorts in Sun Bronze or Black.\n\nGentlemen, do not allow bashfulness to hinder your well-being. If you grapple with conditions such as edema or deep vein thrombosis, or if your daily activities involve prolonged sitting or standing, it would be prudent to consult your physician about the potential benefits of wearing compression pantyhose. You will likely find this advice to be invaluable.\n\nIt is essential to note that these garments are not exclusively for women; men can also reap their health advantages. I, for instance, was advised by my doctor to wear them to mitigate lower leg edema. This particular brand offers robust support, is economically priced, and provides an appealing aesthetic and comfortable feel on the legs.

{"text": "Frugal Living Chronicles: A Week of Thrifty Adventures\nBy Amanda, January 25, 2013\n\nGreetings, Frugal Living Enthusiasts!\n\nHere's my frugal tale for the week:\n\nLast weekend, I secured an intriguing mystery shopping gig at a racetrack. Originally planned as a delightful date night with my husband, an unexpected office emergency altered our plans. Despite his absence, I enjoyed myself immensely. All expenses, including three bets, dinner, a drink, admission, and a program, were covered, and I even earned a $60 stipend. Needless to say, I eagerly anticipate more assignments of this nature.\n\nThis week, I'm thrilled to share my own frugal feat: For the first time in several months, I meticulously planned my grocery and meal shopping, ensuring I didn't overspend on food. Not only did I stick to my budget, but I also maintained a healthy diet, with edamame becoming my new favorite culinary discovery.\n\nNuccio Bruno recently shared... It's W-2 Season\n\nHaha, there's no such thing as too many frugal confessions! I, too, appreciate the foresight of planning meals before grocery shopping. It's a small effort that saves time and money in the long run, and it's reassuring to know exactly what to cook and have the necessary ingredients on hand after a long day at work.\n\nThank you for sharing your story, Amanda L. Grossman recently posted... Savings Accounts: A Necessity for the Lower and Middling Classes\n\nHaving acquired a home espresso machine, I am now saving $5 daily on my morning coffee expenditure. As an espresso aficionado, the decision was challenging, but I can still indulge on weekends. The bonus is that it's an affordable pour-over coffee maker, priced at $20 along with $5 for filters, and remarkably easy to clean and operate.\n\nMy Dell PC malfunctioned last night, and after seeking service (out of warranty), I was quoted $250 plus parts. I discovered a local technician on Yelp who performed the repair for $100.\n\nIn a recent frugality triumph, I redeemed a Schick Hydro Silk razor coupon (usually $13) near its expiration, pairing it with a CVS deal to earn $5 in ExtraBucks rewards.\n\nThis year, I filed my taxes using TaxAct instead of purchasing TurboTax, despite not finding it as user-friendly, as I grew weary of annual purchases.\n\nIn your recent racing venture, did you emerge victorious? Which racetrack did you visit, and did you make your own betting decisions? I, too, am a passionate horse racing enthusiast, often spending entire weekends engrossed in the sport, which necessitates careful time management.", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "219f8bfa-4b79-48eb-a80a-d9ed267e6ce6", "url": "http://www.frugalconfessions.com/frugal-confessions/frugal-confessions-friday-frugal-living-81.php"}

The eclectic mix of these elements truly enhances the atmosphere.\n\nI'm unsure if you share an interest in dance music, but I must recommend a particular mashup that has captivated me: 'I Wanna Bulletproof Dancer'. This ingenious blend combines Whitney Houston's 'I Wanna Dance with Somebody', La Roux's 'Bulletproof', Robyn's 'Dancing On My Own', and Taylor Swift's 'You Belong to Me'. The genius of this mashup lies not only in the seamless fusion of the music but also in the harmonious integration of the lyrics.", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "109bcbab-de43-4aee-a657-b710be3ca938", "url": "http://www.hometheaterforum.com/community/threads/favorite-mash-ups.304797/"}

These platforms facilitate users to download videos at no cost via SnapTube Video Downloader. While there are other applications that operate similarly to SnapTube, such as TubeMate YouTube, YouTv Player, Play Movie, YouTube, and VidMate, SnapTube stands out due to several unique features:\n\n- A clean, user-friendly interface that ensures 100% safety for users\n- The ability to discover new content in your favorite categories, including music and videos\n- SnapTube Video Downloader also converts Mp4 files into Mp3, eliminating the need for additional USB or plug-ins\n- Offers MP4 in various resolutions, ranging from 144 to 2048 * 1080 HD pixels\n- Searching for videos on SnapTube is simplified – users only need to type in the keywords of their desired video\n- Provides users with the option to pause, resume, or play the downloading process at their convenience\n- Does not support any form of advertisements or pop-ups, ensuring a smooth downloading experience without any distractions\n\nYou may have encountered APK files while browsing the web. APK stands for Android Application Package. When users are unable to download a specific application from its official website or the Google Play Store, they can effectively download these APK files. For Android users, there are several fast platforms available for APK downloads. PC users can download APK files using emulators such as Andyroid or BlueStacks, which enable one PC to mimic another.\n\nSnapTube for Android\n\nEn route to an event, we envision downloading videos and movies, facilitated by a reliable internet connection, allowing us to share content with friends via our mobile devices. However, the absence of SnapTube on the Google Play Store presents a hurdle for Android users seeking to download the application. Not to worry, as SnapTube APK is readily available for Android users, guaranteed to be safe and clean. Here's a step-by-step guide to download SnapTube Video Downloader:\n\n1. Initiate a search for \"SnapTube Video Downloader APK\".\n2. Download it from its official website or UptoDown, the authorized download hub for SnapTube.\n\nRegrettably, APK files are incompatible with iOS devices, including iPhones, iPads, and Macs. Currently, SnapTube is exclusively available for Android OS users. Fortunately, iOS users have a viable alternative in MXTube, which mirrors SnapTube's functionality, features, and downloading style. To download MXTube on iOS devices, follow these steps:\n\n1. Download and install Cydia on your device.\n2. Once the installation is complete, search for MXTube video downloader within Cydia.\n3. Download the initial component for MXTube.\n4. Return to your home screen and locate the MXTube application. Open it to commence unlimited video downloading.\n\nIn conclusion, iOS users can now rejoice, as they have a viable solution for video downloading. What are your thoughts on this?\n\nFor PC users, SnapTube is still unavailable on the Microsoft Store. However, users can circumvent this by installing an emulator on their PC to download SnapTube.\n\nPrior to initiating the installation of emulators such as Andyroid or BlueStacks, it is crucial to ensure that your hardware, including your graphics card and Windows operating system, are up-to-date. This is to prevent potential crashes or freezes that could occur if your system is not compatible. Similarly, when downloading Snaptube for PC (compatible with Windows 7, 8.1, and 10), it is important to follow the steps carefully.\n\nBegin by downloading either BlueStacks or Andyroid onto your PC. Once downloaded, proceed to install the software. After installation, launch the application and adjust the initial settings as required. Log in using your Google account and search for the SnapTube Apk file.\n\nLocate the primary URL of the SnapTube App APK file and commence the download process. Follow the on-screen instructions to successfully install the application on your PC or desktop.\n\nRegarding SnapTube, it is worth noting that while there are several websites offering SnapTube Apk files for Android OS, SnapTube is widely recognized as the premier YouTube video downloader.

The reviewer praises the owner, Luisa, for her exceptional hospitality, including personal shopping trips, visits to local attractions like the chocolate factory and Mamon village, and even arranging a singer for a group gathering. The guest felt so welcomed that they returned for another stay of 57 nights, describing the experience as akin to being part of the family. The guest also highlights the property's competitive pricing and the owner's helpful contacts for local excursions.\n\nFor nearly two decades, I have been frequenting the Dominican Republic, with my accommodation of choice being the Grand Paradise in Puerto Plata. However, I have recently developed a preference for renting in the nearby community of Costambar, which offers a high level of security. I often take leisurely morning and evening walks without any sense of trepidation, as the presence of patrolling police officers is constant, providing a reassuring atmosphere. I have also mastered the use of the local public transportation system, known as 'guaguas,' to travel to the city for a mere 25 pesos, an experience that is both economical and culturally enriching.\n\nThe pawn shop in the area is a hidden gem, offering New Larimar jewelry at prices significantly lower than those found in typical retail stores. For instance, pieces that would normally retail for around $120 can be found there for as little as $20 to $30, along with a variety of other silver and gold items, both new and used.\n\nDuring my stay, I had the pleasure of dining at two exceptional restaurants: Sharky's and Solemio. The culinary experiences at both establishments were nothing short of exquisite. I must express my gratitude to Luisa for orchestrating such a delightful vacation. I am already eagerly anticipating my return next year. In the spirit of full disclosure, I should mention that I had intended to share a photograph of Luisa and I dancing at a party, but alas, I was overcome with laughter at the memory, and thus, the image remains a private momento.

{"text": "A light repast can be had an hour later, as we discovered upon walking past the vacant Guluppi and deciding to dine there nonetheless. Our order comprised Gorgonzola Dolce for one, mussels and a mixed fish and shellfish platter for the other, accompanied by a bottle of dry Prosecco. The mussel broth proved to be exceptional, though finding value for money in Burano's eateries can be challenging due to varying prices and mandatory service fees. Galuppi, however, offered reasonable rates, with a €1.50 cover charge and a 10% service fee, compared to other establishments charging up to €3 and 12% respectively.\n\nIn our exploration of Burano, we happened upon this restaurant, where we were greeted warmly and seated by a polite gentleman. The staff provided excellent service, and we enjoyed a light meal of chicken, mushroom, and cream spaghetti (a special of the day) and lasagne. Our bill for two beers and a shared order of clams amounted to approximately €24, which, while somewhat steep, was not unexpected given the area's dining prices.\n\nOn another visit, we stopped by for a quick bite while sightseeing, securing a pleasant table in the sun for people-watching. Although many island restaurants are pricey, we found the food here enjoyable, though the service was somewhat hurried, perhaps aiming for a swift turnover. Despite entering solely for refreshments, we were greeted warmly and the service was friendly, with fellow patrons raving about the delicious food.\n\nDespite the anecdotal nature of the information, given the consensus among patrons of their contentment with the primary fish offerings, I deemed it fitting to share my experience... Ristorante Galluppi, situated in the heart of Venice's tourist district, proved to be unremarkable, as one might anticipate. My companion opted for the fish dishes, given our location, while I selected pasta 'fruto di mare'. In retrospect, we might have chosen more wisely, resulting in an unremarkable meal that did little to showcase the delights of Italian cuisine or the fresh seafood for which Venice is renowned.", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "a44bdcc2-e7c3-49c9-883e-6a49bafb8930", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com.au/Restaurant_Review-g1597326-d2456876-Reviews-or20-Restaurant_Galuppi-Burano_Veneto.html"}

Consequently, we've decided to relocate, aiming to settle into a new, smaller home by summer, prior to the baby's arrival.\n\nFurther Alterations\nIn addition to our impending move, Jack, our eldest, will be embarking on a new chapter of his life. I anticipate that he will thrive in preschool, but I also foresee a pang of separation anxiety as a mother. The timing of his enrollment, around the same time as the baby's birth, is both comforting and disconcerting.\n\nAnother Shift\nLastly, Joel has been offered a lieutenant position, presenting a new learning opportunity.

This action, according to CBS Radio's chief executive Joel Hollander, was necessitated by the need to streamline operations and position the company for future growth in an evolving business landscape. Hollander, in a corporate memo obtained by trade publications such as AllAccess, Radio & Records Online, and Reuters, acknowledged the difficulty of such decisions, stating that \"reducing headcount is never easy\".\n\nThe layoffs, affecting a small percentage of CBS Radio's total workforce of around 8500 full-time and part-time employees, spanned various levels and roles, including general managers, sales managers, and program directors, primarily in the company's largest markets. Notably, the CBS Radio cluster in Cleveland may have been spared from these cuts, with reports even suggesting that a morning drive voice in that cluster had recently renewed their contract.\n\nThe decision to downsize has sparked criticism, with one commenter suggesting that Hollander himself, given his perceived role in the decline of CBS's New York City FM stations and his reported high salary, should be among those considered for elimination.", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "b56b219a-8db9-4ee3-9efe-1c94b565222f", "url": "http://ohiomedia.blogspot.com/2006/07/this-is-not-cbs-at-least-for-115.html"}

Economy Secretary Ken Skates has disclosed that sites in and around the Wrexham area are being seriously considered for this purpose.\n\nThis announcement comes as Finance Wales, which is set to transform into the Development Bank of Wales, reports that the North Wales region experienced its most active year in 2019. Ken Skates commented, \"Our decision to base the headquarters of the new Development Bank in North Wales is a testament to our commitment to distributing prosperity and jobs across all regions of Wales. This location will allow the bank to capitalize on the growth opportunities presented by the cross-border Financial and Professional Services sector.\"\n\nFinance Wales' successful track record in North Wales, with an impact of £26.6 million invested in 43 businesses last year, has led to the consideration of these Wrexham-area sites.

We're looking to expand our presence by more than doubling our team in the region.\"\n\nAs the transition to the Development Bank of Wales progresses, Thorley emphasized the importance of maintaining a strong presence in all regions to support a greater number of micro to medium-sized enterprises.\n\nAccording to recent data, Finance Wales directly invested £7.7 million in North Wales during the last fiscal year, thereby attracting an additional £19 million from other investors. Looking ahead, the Development Bank of Wales is slated to provide over £1 billion in investment support to Welsh businesses over the next five years, significantly enhancing access to finance, support services, and management advice for micro to medium-sized enterprises. By 2022, this initiative aims to create and safeguard over 5,500 jobs annually and increase annual direct investment to £80 million.

{"text": "Guest Reviews (408 Verified)\n\n- Proximity to Beach, Noise Concerns\n  - May 30, 2017: A verified traveler praised the hotel's beach accessibility, being just a short walk away. However, they noted issues with a noisy air conditioner and a persistent vibration noise that disrupted their sleep.\n  - May 18, 2017: Another verified traveler gave a mixed review, appreciating the hotel's central location and pool area, but rating the overall experience as merely satisfactory.\n  - May 11, 2017: A guest from Austin highlighted the hotel's proximity to the beach and its appealing exterior, but reported a musty smell in their room and found the hotel less clean and nice compared to the Hampton Inn, despite its higher price.\n  - Mar 31, 2017: A traveler from San Antonio expressed frustration with guests occupying the hot tub for extended periods, preventing them from using it.\n  - Mar 27, 2017: A verified traveler praised the hotel's cleanliness, friendly staff, and convenient beach location.\n\nManagement Response\n\n- Mar 30, 2017: Melanie, from hotel management, responded to a guest named Jesse, thanking them for their feedback.\n- 1 out of 5: A verified traveler left a low rating without providing further details.\n\nOn Orbitz, a user identified as Donald posted a review on February 26, 2017, detailing his stay at the Holiday Inn Express in Port Aransas, Texas, from March 7, 2017. The review began by stating that there were no positive aspects to his experience. Initially, a fire in the staff pantry led to significant inconvenience for several hours for all guests. Furthermore, the user expressed dissatisfaction with the pricing structure, describing it as exorbitant, particularly during the off-peak season. The total cost for a two-night stay was $429.00, which the user considered a 'rip off'. Additionally, the user was charged this amount twice, along with an extra $75.00, which they disputed with their bank. The user's overall rating for the hotel was one out of five, and they expressed their intention to never stay at this hotel again due to these experiences.\n\nThis was, without a doubt, the most miserable hotel experience I've had in my 66 years. The issues began with door closers that were poorly adjusted, allowing doors to slam shut at late hours and early mornings. Furthermore, the hotel's construction lacked adequate insulation between floors, resulting in a cacophony of noise with each step taken above. The final straw was the manager's decision to remove all our belongings from our room after just one day, despite our three-day reservation. I received a puzzling call afterwards, with the manager's representative claiming ignorance about the reason for the call. Upon my immediate return to the property, I discovered that our belongings had indeed been removed. During an inventory check, I found two missing items, which were later discovered in the garbage, one of them covered in coffee grounds. When I questioned why they didn't contact me before the removal, they claimed they had tried, a claim that was refuted by my phone records, which showed no missed calls. My advice to potential guests: if you find yourself in Port Arkansas with this hotel as your only option, consider alternative accommodations, such as your car.\n\nDespite these issues, the front desk staff received praise for their friendliness and helpfulness. They went above and beyond to guide us to the best birding sites in the area. The hotel management responded to this five-star review, expressing gratitude and hoping for the guest's return. Another guest, Mary, also left a five-star review, with no further details provided. The hotel management responded to this review as well, expressing their appreciation.\n\nOur sincere gratitude, Mary, for your exceptional review. We eagerly anticipate welcoming you back to Port Aransas on your future visits.", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "a5604a21-baf7-4d59-9500-f777574e7c57", "url": "https://www.expedia.com/Corpus-Christi-Hotels-Holiday-Inn-Express-Suites-Port-AransasBeach-Area.h1305347.Hotel-Reviews?rm1=a2"}

{"text": "I, too, am captivated by this subject, as I grapple with significant temporal recession, yet maintain a longer length in the midsection of my hair (around 2 to 3 inches), which effectively conceals the affected area. However, I require a means to keep it in place, as exposure to wind causes it to become disheveled and unsightly. I harbor reservations about employing gel or wax, as I fear they will accentuate the thinning and make the recession more apparent. I have discovered that Tesco's Maximum Hold Hairspray provides exceptional grip, outperforming more costly alternatives, but I am troubled by the potential damage it may inflict on my hair.\n\nThe Dax Wave and Groom product, when used in conjunction with Sainsbury's Max Hold Hairspray, does not seem to exacerbate the appearance of thinning, an observation I have made based on personal experience. I have previously relied on Tesco's Maximum Hold Hairspray for years, but a recent alteration in its ingredients has led to a decrease in its holding power. I would like to emphasize that storing the Dax wax in the freezer for approximately 15 minutes prior to use can enhance its firmness and minimize the risk of making hair appear thinner.\n\nYou can acquire the Dax wax from Boots for around £4 per tin. I am grateful for the insights shared by the community. My local Sainsbury's only stocks the Form Hold variant, which I have been using for a couple of weeks with satisfactory results, save for one peculiar day when its holding power seemed to wane.

{"text": "On the 24th of March, 2007, a Saturday, the individual's dreams were dominated by visions of weddings, featuring a multitude of bridal gowns in various hues, and solemn vows of eternal commitment. The dreamer's emotional state within these dreams varied, with some iterations expressing joy, while others conveyed discontent. A cursory online investigation into the symbolism of such dreams revealed several potential interpretations, including: a) a desire to enter into marital union, b) an indication of significant life transitions, particularly within interpersonal relationships, and c) a need to reconcile disparate aspects of one's life.\n\nThe initial euphoria of the individual's relationship with Beowulf had begun to dissipate, a development that had occurred nearly two months after they had officially begun their union. This shift was accompanied by a series of challenges, including puritanical guilt stemming from their physical intimacy, Beowulf's anxiety disorder and resultant paranoia that something was amiss, and the dreamer's inherent wanderlust. On this particular day, Beowulf and a significant portion of the individual's local friends had embarked on a hiking excursion, which the dreamer chose to forgo in favor of remaining in bed, lost in dreams of weddings and consumed by worry.

{"text": "On the evening of September 12, 2012, I returned from a Fire Commissioners' meeting, yet I found myself hesitant to pen down my thoughts. The meeting's agenda, though extensive, was largely dominated by mundane topics presented in an unusually convoluted manner. The crux of the discussion, however, revolved around Chief Carleton's revised employment contract, which was purportedly amended to rectify previous errors – a phrase that would have made George Orwell chuckle, no doubt.\n\nLast month, we had been privy to the contents of the unamended contract, but this time around, we were merely given a verbal description of the revised version. The updated contract was slated to be uploaded onto the Fire District's website that very night. Until I could peruse it myself, I remained uncertain about the precise nature of the corrections made.\n\nBased on the verbal description, it seemed that Chief Carleton's newly revised contract rescinded all full-time benefits that had been associated with his part-time employment in the previous, unamended contract. However, without having read the contract myself, I could not definitively confirm what was being offered.", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "b4daffa9-914b-4676-a613-0972c6a45038", "url": "http://getthewholepicture.blogspot.com/2012/09/not-much-story-at-all.html"}

{"text": "\"Six years ago, in Spain, I underwent a straightforward extraction of my upper wisdom teeth, enduring only a couple of days of significant pain and a week of minor discomfort. Despite my initial apprehension, which led me to feign distress to avoid work, the procedure was relatively tolerable. In stark contrast, the removal of my lower wisdom teeth, performed two years ago in the UK, was an ordeal. The extraction of a single tooth took approximately an hour, requiring the concerted efforts of three dental professionals to stabilize my jaw while I witnessed their strenuous exertion. The tooth was fragmented to facilitate its removal, and anesthesia was administered twice. The subsequent week was marked by persistent jaw pain, likely a result of the considerable force exerted during the procedure. Fortunately, I no longer possess any wisdom teeth, sparing me from future extractions. In a shift to lighter topics, I found your mention of 'cheese toasty' amusing, so much so that it has become my word of the week. I am now compelled to prepare a cheese toasty, accompanied by ketchup, for my enjoyment. Timpanogos' self-proclaimed unicorn status has sparked a playful exchange, while band-aid and whatbearisbest have joined in, expressing their enthusiasm for the now-viral 'cheese toasty' phrase.

{"text": "This digital journal serves as a repository of my experiences and visual chronicles.

While I acknowledge my shopping addiction, I jest that it may require therapeutic intervention.\n\nFriday, March 22, 2013 - Mayy's Closet\n\nSome Friday evenings warrant a touch of elegance, especially when they mark the start of a weekend filled with birthday celebrations for friends. Thus, I made an effort to dress up for the occasion.\n\nOutfit of the Day/ Night (OOTD/N)\n\nMy daytime attire was understated, comprising a black cardigan, gold loafers from Kmart, red lipstick, and eyeliner. However, as the evening approached, I transformed my look by adding bangles, swapping my flats for red suede heels from Forever New, and applying more makeup.\n\nArriving early for our plans, I found myself with time to spare and wandered down King Street for some shopping. Regrettably, I indulged in impulse purchases, but the guilt was momentarily assuaged by my new acquisitions.\n\nMy favorite oversized clutch, adorned with a touch of glitter and glam from Valleygirl, was both stylish and functional, holding an impressive amount of my belongings.\n\nThe dress, an older piece from Love Bonito, was worn for the first time that Friday. I appreciated its thick, high-quality material, though I must admit that some of their newer items do not meet the same standard. The military-inspired design could easily transition to a nautical theme, and I found myself wishing for a captain's blazer to complete the look. The dress also featured a charming tulip skirt hem.\n\nThe photographs from the night captured the vibrant color of my heels beautifully, making for memorable keepsakes.", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "7d5b53d8-a297-49f8-b9c9-123fd868522d", "url": "https://mayydiaries.blogspot.com/2013/03/mayys-closet_22.html"}

{"text": "In my ongoing pursuit of cosmetics and beauty products, I present my second box from Vanity Trove, procured at a discounted rate of SGD20 (usually SGD25) via the online platforms Gmarket and Qoo10. For those unfamiliar with VanityTrove, I invite you to explore my earlier post for a more comprehensive understanding of the brand.\n\nInitially, I harbored reservations about subscribing to their service, but after receiving an AmazingBox from a friend, I was eager to try a subscription box service based in Singapore. My first Trove, received in November 2012, was a back-order and did not meet my expectations. The products featured in the unveiling were not the same as those I received, and the back-order Trove cost an additional SGD5, totaling SGD30 for what I considered a meager selection.\n\nDespite my initial disappointment, I was ultimately won over by the quality of the box contents. Here are close-up shots and my reviews of the items in my November Trove, after using them for about a month:\n\n- Pupa Vamp! Mascara, 0.4ml - Italy: This mascara provided intense, dark black color, adding volume and thickness to my lashes. Its water resistance proved exceptional, withstanding my watery eyes without smudging or staining. The mascara's casing, with its bright, sparkly, metallic design, added a touch of elegance to my purse or handbag.\n\nIn the spirit of sharing my experiences and insights, I hope this review aids you in discovering new beauty products that cater to your preferences.\n\nURIAGE AquaPRECIS Moisturizing Refreshing Cream Gel, 5ml - France\nThis cream gel, extracted from its tube, presents as a predominantly white, creamy substance with a slight gel-like consistency. It exhibits remarkable spreadability, requiring only a small amount, akin to a 10-cent coin, to cover the entire face and neck. Upon application, it is swiftly absorbed into the skin, leaving no sticky residue or sensation. The skin's appearance is matte, yet it feels well-hydrated. When used as a base before makeup for work, it neither exacerbates nor mitigates the skin's natural oiliness, indicating excellent absorption.\n\nZA Total Hydration Amino Mineral Refreshing Gel with vitamin B, 5g - Vietnam\nUpon its launch in Singapore, this product was prominently featured in Watsons stores, allowing for extensive testing. The application and absorption were notably satisfying, leaving the skin of the back of the hand hydrated and moist. Despite the temptation to purchase, the user's preference for affordable skincare products from stores like Daiso and Gmarket.Qoo10 prevailed. However, upon receiving a sample via Vanity Trove, the user was delighted to find that the product lived up to its claims. It provided a matte finish while maintaining skin suppleness, helping to delay the emergence of shine under makeup. The user highly recommends this gel for those with combination-oily skin seeking lightweight, fast-absorbing hydration that lasts.\n\nLaline Body Cream Ocean, a 60ml product from Israel, retails at SGD9.90. Although I've not commenced its use, I can already detect a light, refreshing, and non-powdery fragrance through its sealed packaging, which is promising. I'm particularly averse to cream, gel, or perfume with a powdery scent.\n\nThe ADORE Sanitary Napkin, which I've yet to use, seems to be a delightful addition to my collection.\n\nThe Neogence Extreme Pore-Reducing Serum, a 7ml product from Taiwan, has been a revelation. While I haven't noticed any significant pore reduction, I've found that a little goes a long way. Its standout feature is its exceptional oil control, maintaining my skin's matte appearance without compromising its suppleness. It effectively primes my skin, preventing shine from breaking through my makeup and extending its longevity.\n\nThe Vitacreme B12, a 3ml regenerative cream from Switzerland, has been applied to my neck. Despite its light pink hue and pleasant scent, I've yet to observe any reduction in my neck lines. It has a thicker consistency but spreads easily, taking slightly longer to absorb than other products in my Nov Trove routine. I'll provide an update in a few months' time as I continue to use it.\n\nBeyond the enjoyable experience I had with the November Trove, I must admit that my December Trove has left me even more impressed. The majority of the items were new to me, and I am eagerly anticipating their performance. I would advise potential subscribers to consider a one-month subscription as a trial before committing to a full year, as the cost can be significant. Notably, the promotional price currently available on Gmarket.Qoo10 presents an attractive opportunity.

{"text": "Mark Webster Estate Agents, a family-run business, has been serving Tamworth Town Centre since its inception. Mark Webster, with nearly two decades of industry experience, specializes in Tamworth, Atherstone, and nearby villages. His expertise and dedicated team, known for their enthusiasm, honesty, and reliability, ensure clients receive comprehensive advice and support throughout their property journey.\n\nThe agency's dual offices in Tamworth and Atherstone, coupled with prominent online platforms and a robust social media presence, deliver a professional service. They guide clients through sales, purchases, or rentals, aiming to achieve the best possible outcomes.\n\nOne client praised the agency's service, highlighting timely appointments, regular feedback, and a swift sale at a fair price, all facilitated by the friendly and efficient team, particularly Stacey. Another client, Jane, was commended for her proactive approach during the sales progression stage, ensuring a smooth and stress-free process despite challenging circumstances.\n\nTestimonials consistently praise the agency's professionalism and ease of dealing with, with one client rating them a perfect 5/5 and highlighting Mark Webster's consistent high standards.\n\nThe service rendered by Mark Webster, at both the Atherstone and Tamworth branches, was commendable. Notably, Jane from the Tamworth shop demonstrated exceptional efficiency, professionalism, and empathy towards the complexities of the house sale, significantly alleviating stress throughout the process. I am grateful for her understanding and support.\n\nHaving recently sold my house through Mark Webster, I was pleased with the overall customer experience. The process was supportive and professional, with good communication and a clear demonstration of local knowledge. The team, particularly Naomi, exhibited excellent diplomatic skills and secured a favorable deal, earning every penny of the commission. I found their services to be reasonable and would recommend them.\n\nMark Webster's customer service was exceptional, warranting the highest recommendation. Having used their services twice, I can attest to the consistent excellence in service, with both properties selling quickly. I was kept well-informed throughout the process.\n\nRegarding agent fees, I was satisfied with the charges, finding them to be better value for money compared to larger agencies, coupled with superior service.\n\nAfter a 35-year hiatus from moving, Mark Webster guided us seamlessly through every stage of the sale, providing helpful advice and support. The entire staff was attentive and reassuring, making the process as stress-free as possible, even with a long and complex chain. I would definitely use their services again.\n\nMy initial meeting with Mark Webster was informative and reassuring. Despite the complexities of my sale, I was provided with clear explanations and helpful advice. Regular updates were provided throughout the process, and I would wholeheartedly recommend their services.\n\nAfter a disappointing experience with another firm, Mark Webster stepped in to assist us in finding a new residence. Throughout the purchasing process, they remained consistently accessible, attentive, and considerate, ensuring our needs were met at every turn. Each staff member we interacted with exhibited kindness and professionalism, making our experience exceedingly positive. We are thrilled with the service we received and would wholeheartedly recommend Mark Webster to others.\n\nMark Webster demonstrated exceptional efficiency in photographing and listing our property within a matter of hours. Their team, including Mark himself, displayed a high level of experience and professionalism. The office staff were equally proficient and helpful, successfully selling our property within a week and maintaining open communication throughout.\n\nIn a previous transaction, despite facing challenges due to a buyer's withdrawal, Mark Webster's team, led by Naomi, provided invaluable support throughout the conveyancing process. Their assistance was particularly notable as we were not their primary client, yet they treated us with the same level of care and professionalism.\n\nWe regret not having sold our property through Mark Webster, as we have only heard positive reviews about their service. Our experience with their team, notably Claire and Emma, was exemplary, with regular updates and friendly, helpful assistance throughout the sales process. We would strongly recommend Mark Webster to anyone considering selling their property.\n\nUpon commencing our house hunt, we visited local real estate agencies in Tamworth Town Centre on a Saturday, with Mark Webster & Co being the most attentive in understanding our property preferences and existing property. Mark personally inspected both our houses and provided clear guidance.\n\nFor our second property, after previous agents' failures, we engaged Mark Webster & Co for rental with a view to later sale. They were realistic and proactive, marketing the property to both rental and investment markets. Mark and Naomi's efforts resulted in a sale within four months, with weekly updates from Naomi ensuring transparency throughout.\n\nThe agent fees were reasonable and competitive, providing excellent value for the service received. Mark's personal visit, honesty, and efficiency in valuing and marketing our property were commendable. Within a short period, we received multiple offers, and the office staff, notably Hannah and Shelley, maintained regular communication throughout the process.\n\nIn another instance, Mark sold a client's mother's bungalow within 40 minutes of his arrival, demonstrating his understanding of the local market and effective client management, with Rachel handling subsequent procedures. Overall, the service was exceptional, making it highly unlikely that another agent could match it.\n\nOur recent house sale, facilitated by Mark Webster & Co., was an exemplary process. Throughout, we were consistently informed about the progress, with no aspect left unattended. We wholeheartedly endorse this family-run firm to anyone considering selling their property. Their service was impeccable, deserving of the highest praise.\n\nIn my experience, Mark Webster Estate Agents stand out among the five estate agents I've encountered in recent years. Their professionalism and commitment to assisting buyers and sellers, rather than merely focusing on profit, is commendable. My sister, impressed by my recommendation, is now using their services to sell her property.\n\nAs a buyer, I wasn't privy to the agent fees, but the adage 'you get what you pay for' certainly applies. Despite challenges in selling my mother's house, Naomi from Mark Webster & Co. was always accessible, addressing queries and issues promptly and cheerfully. Her dedication ensured the sale's successful completion. I would unreservedly recommend Mark Webster & Co.\n\nOur recent experience with Mark Webster & Co. was exceptional. From the initial valuation to the final key handover, we were kept informed weekly by Naomi, who was invaluable in her support. We are grateful to Mark and his outstanding team for making our move stress-free and seamless. We would not hesitate to recommend their services for any property-related needs.\n\nInitially, we were hesitant to engage with Mark Webster and Co due to a previous unsatisfactory encounter with another agent. However, our experience with Mark Webster proved to be exceptional. Mark and his team fulfilled their promises, demonstrating an cheerful, friendly, and above all, efficient demeanor. We regretted not approaching them first. Special thanks to Rachel and Naomi for their outstanding work and excellent communication skills.\n\nThe Tamworth office team deserves our gratitude for facilitating our house sale. Claire, in particular, was always accessible and eager to assist, her bright and cheerful manner reflecting a genuine concern for our well-being. We extend our thanks to the entire team.\n\nMark Webster exhibited a high level of professionalism and a clear 'can-do' attitude. His intimate knowledge of the local market and area, coupled with his sound advice, was invaluable. The staff conducted a high number of viewings, notifying us via email for each, and providing regular, weekly feedback via telephone.

{"text": "On the 13th of September, 2007, on a Thursday, a non-working mother shared her thoughts in a blog post. She had been inspired to start her own blog after reading those of her family members, feeling a sense of inadequacy despite her dedication to her family. She prefaced her writing by stating that she did not claim to be a skilled writer, and thus, her blog might not be the most captivating or humorous, but she hoped it would still be engaging enough for readers to learn about her family's life.\n\nThe author began by explaining the name of her blog. She was in the process of purchasing a home, and when she contacted mortgage companies for quotes, they inevitably asked for her employment details. She found this question challenging to answer, as her role as a stay-at-home mother was multifaceted and often misunderstood. She humorously suggested that she worked \"everywhere, everyday, in every profession,\" but typically responded with \"I don't work,\" despite the inaccuracies of this statement.\n\nShe then elaborated on the misconceptions surrounding her role. While she did have moments of respite, such as a rare nap, these were earned after managing her children's behavior in public places, often involving negotiations and bribes. She also discussed her blog's polka-dot background, which she had chosen in an attempt to emulate the engaging and amusing blogs of her sisters-in-law, despite her awareness of the vast differences in their writing styles.\n\nHer post concluded with a humorous self-deprecating remark about her new role as a professional pencil sharpener, as her sons had recently requested her assistance with this task. Her blog post received three comments.\n\nGreetings, Jessica, and welcome to the realm of blogging! I am delighted that you have decided to embark on this journey, as it will enable us to stay abreast of your activities.

{"text": "On June 7, 2007, a Thursday, I chronicled my week's cycling adventures, marked by a notable shift from the usual routine. The preceding weekend's intense racing had left me with weary legs, prompting me to take a day off on Monday. However, this week proved to be an exception to my typical recovery pattern. Tuesday's inclement weather led to the cancellation of our regular women's ride, but a small group of us, undeterred, decided to venture out and brave any rain that might come our way. Tami, Carrie, and I met another cyclist at the Lexington Green and set off. Tami, a skilled Cat 2 racer on our elite team, expressed her desire to undertake a strenuous effort, and strenuous it was. We covered 26 miles at an average speed of 21.3 mph, a pace that, outside of time trials, was the fastest I had ever maintained. This rigorous ride left my already tired legs feeling even more fatigued.\n\nWednesday arrived, typically my time trial day, but my legs, still recovering from Tuesday's exertion, were not up to the task. My partner, Mike, who had also pushed himself hard on Tuesday, agreed that the time trial was not feasible for us. Instead, we opted for an \"easy\" tandem ride, which, despite our intentions, proved to be quite challenging due to the omni-directional wind. We rode 45 miles, even managing to greet our friends who had attempted the time trial the previous evening. By the end of the day, my quadriceps were extremely sore, and my legs were utterly exhausted. I still had the Cat 4 women's team ride scheduled for that evening, with a focus on sprinting and pack riding, and I hoped to contribute more through coaching than actual riding. I eagerly anticipated a few days off from cycling over the weekend.", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "0031f59a-e809-4c03-a607-ba6d7e888d4a", "url": "http://twoadventures.blogspot.com/2007/06/oh-my-legs.html"}

{"text": "Introducing: Festive Bar Cart Accents with VOVETI\nA new addition has graced the Hoyne House: a gleaming gold bar cart, now taking pride of place in our shared space. After much consideration, I settled on this particular model, eager to embark on a new chapter of hosting. With the holiday season upon us, and our home adorned with a festive tree and decorations, I am delighted to share how we have styled our cart in collaboration with VOVETI Prosecco.\n\nThis bar cart is a recent acquisition, marking my inaugural foray into the world of home bartending. I am excited to share my findings on how to transform this piece into the perfect centerpiece for entertaining. Below, I have compiled a list of essentials to elevate your bar cart game for your next gathering.\n\nHoliday Entertaining: The Art of the Bar Cart\n- Liquid Libations: The cornerstone of any bar cart is, of course, your choice of alcoholic beverages. For celebrations, I invariably opt for sparkling wine, as it instantly sets a festive tone and caters to those who wish to create wine cocktails. This holiday season, I have placed VOVETI Prosecco prominently on the top shelf. This brut DOC offers a balanced acidity and a refreshing, elegant profile, making it an excellent pairing for an assortment of cheeses and a delightful aperitif or cocktail to share with friends.\n- Hostess Hack: To add a touch of whimsy, consider ordering VOVETI's mini bottles and providing festive straws, encouraging guests to indulge in a drink with added flair.\n\nMixer Selection: Contemplate the wine cocktails you intend to serve. I procured a few delectable options from Trader Joe's, yet the choices are plentiful and unlikely to disappoint. I often enhance the presentation of my cocktails with small garnishes such as cranberries and/or rosemary sprigs. Recently, I acquired an attractive gold shaker from Home Goods for under $10.\n\nAromatic Accents: No bar cart is complete without a candle or two. My personal preference leans towards holiday scents from Nest, but feel free to choose your favorites. Bath & Body Works is another excellent destination for fragrance shopping, especially when they offer their enticing sales on collections.\n\nBar Cart Literature: My initial selection of books for the bar cart was straightforward, but I was fortunate to receive a copy of \"The Art of the Bar Cart: Styling & Recipes\" as a gift. This guide has proven invaluable in my quest to arrange my bar cart in a visually appealing and user-friendly manner, as it turns out there's more to it than one might initially think.", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "fe155240-781d-47d4-b188-32b4a2325419", "url": "http://www.onelittleblackblog.com/2017/12/holiday-bar-cart-style-with-voveti.html"}

{"text": "I have not been in the habit of producing monthly income reports, and I must confess that I have not prioritized the time to do so. However, creating some form of report during one's blogging or entrepreneurial journey, especially if aiming to inspire others, can be beneficial. It allows both the creator and the audience to track progress and set future goals. Therefore, I shall endeavor to keep this report concise and informative.\n\nSix months into my blogging venture seems an appropriate interval for my first report. Coincidentally, this period aligns with the tax season in my household, and I have generated a modest income from my blog during this time. Thus, it is crucial to maintain accurate records for legal and accounting purposes.

Initially, I envisioned merely supplementing our household income, allowing me to remain at home. However, as I continue to work, learn, and grow passionate about sharing solutions and fostering dreams, I now see this as a genuine SECOND INCOME.

The breakfast offerings included not only traditional English fare but also Japanese and Chinese options, catering to diverse tastes.\n\nOne potential drawback, however, was the provision of amenities from Bottega Veneta, an undeniably luxurious brand, yet given our stay in London, a quintessentially British label might have been more fitting.\n\nThis establishment, situated in the very heart of London, has left us with an exceptionally positive impression, as we have now had the pleasure of visiting twice in a short span. Its strategic location, proximity to major attractions, and adjacency to a park render it an ideal choice. The staff's warmth and efficiency are truly commendable, from their welcoming greeting upon arrival to their attentive service throughout our stay. Our rooms offered splendid views, were well-equipped with amenities, and featured exceedingly comfortable beds, providing the perfect respite after a day spent exploring the city. The concierge service was particularly noteworthy, expertly securing reservations at excellent dining establishments. In every aspect, our experience was nothing short of delightful, setting a new standard for what a hotel stay should entail.", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "73f9b9ec-9ee5-4364-8754-c61c97538912", "url": "https://www.virtuoso.com/suppliers/3795/four-seasons-hotel-london-at-park-lane"}

{"text": "On the 16th of June, 2008, I crafted an invitation for my daughter's baptism, aiming for an all-white, elegant aesthetic. The result was, in my humble opinion, flawless, and the process was surprisingly enjoyable and uncomplicated. I trust you'll appreciate the design. Here are the materials I employed: stamps (Sprinkles), pristine white paper, Versamark ink, white embossing powder, a 1 3/4 circle punch, scallop punch, round corner punch, and a ribbon for the finishing touch.\n\nFour days prior, on the 12th of June, I created a card for my beloved grandmother. My intention was to express our affection and wish her a delightful day. The components used were: Fun & Fast Notes and Short & Sweet stamps, white and River Rock paper, retired Designer Series Paper, Close to Cocoa, Groovy Guava, Soft Sky, and Wild Wasabi inks, Hodgepodge Hardware, a Blender pen, dimensionals, and a ribbon.\n\nOn the 6th of June, I designed a card for a shoe box card swap, utilizing the stems of the flower stamp from the Sweet Dreams set to form the base of a cupcake. The card featured Sweet Dreams and Short & Sweet stamps, white, Pretty in Pink, and Prints Pack Designer Series Paper, Wild Wasabi and Pretty in Pink inks, and a scallop punch with silver brads for embellishment.\n\nI also shared some techniques I learned from the swap, including one called Faux Linen. This method involved using glossy cardstock or photo paper, sanding it vertically and horizontally with sandpaper until the gloss was eliminated, and then rubbing ink onto the paper with a sponge. The simplicity of this technique belies its elegant result.\n\nHurrah! The birthday festivities have concluded, yet the merriment lingers.

Our well water has an extremely high alkalinity, which was leading to buildup and stains on the pool floor and walls. This, in turn, provided a surface for algae to attach to. Maintaining a high level of free chlorine (FC) can prevent algae growth, which wasn't the case for me. Now that we're balancing the chemicals correctly, the scaling is subsiding.

Perhaps we could start with a shared meal, a drink, or a casual walk, followed by whatever mutually agreeable activities may ensue. The next move is yours.\n\nCurrently in Sorocaba for a brief stay, I am seeking a woman who is either experienced with or open to exploring strap-on play. I have identified several locations where such encounters might be possible. I am a single, slim, athletic, and disease-free male, and I would be delighted to engage in this activity with you. Beyond strap-on play, our encounter can be tailored to your preferences. Additionally, I am interested in casual morning encounters. I am a 180 lbs, 5'10\" male with an uncut, 7-inch penis, and I am skilled in its use, ensuring a satisfying experience. I also enjoy pleasuring women orally. If you are genuinely interested, please respond with a photograph, and I will reciprocate. I kindly request that you be direct and straightforward to avoid wasting each other's time.\n\nIn search of a casual sexual encounter to alleviate the stress of my day, I am seeking a companion to join me in acquiring a sex toy. You may choose to observe as I experience multiple orgasms, or alternatively, you may use the toy to stimulate me to the point of ecstasy. I am also open to the possibility of a long-term relationship with a woman who is confident in her desires and willing to express them. I am a considerate individual who values open communication and avoids confrontations; I am accepting of others' lifestyles, provided they are respectful. I am not interested in one-night stands or casual encounters. I enjoy relaxation, laughter, and having a good time, and I am fond of cuddling and kissing. I prefer larger or normally sized women, but I am open to dating smaller women as well, provided we are compatible. I am between the ages of X and X, and I hope to hear from you soon. Please include 'SERIOUS RELATIONSHIP' in the subject line to ensure I know you are genuine. I would appreciate it if you did not include a photo in your initial email, but I am willing to exchange photos upon request. Additionally, I am employed, own a car, and have my own place, and I take care of myself. I am looking for friends to join me at swinger sex parties during my vacations, and I am interested in meeting adult women. I hope to build a connection that will last beyond the present moment.\n\nSeeking a Discreet Encounter. Post-Work Hours. Hello there. I'm a woman, recently discharged from the military, now seeking connections with individuals of diverse backgrounds. I'm of average to robust build, with short hair and brown eyes. I'm open to suggestions, so please share a bit about yourself and your movie preference for a potential date. Alternatively, if you're interested in a more casual exchange, I'm open to that as well.\n\nSeeking Solace in Reno\n\nA recently arrived, slender, tattooed individual, new to Reno, is seeking a down-to-earth, intelligent, and spontaneous woman to guide him through the city's offerings. This man, who enjoys concerts, sports, outdoor activities, and literature, is easy-going and open to new experiences. He is explicit in his desire for a physical connection, stating, \"I just want to eat some clean, bare pussy,\" and is open to exploring further if the interest is mutual. He is STD-free, drug-free, and welcomes older women. He is clear in his boundaries, requesting no spam or pay-site solicitations. He is not interested in engaging with individuals involved in drugs like crack or meth.\n\nA Love Lost\n\nA man, under the pseudonym 'My Nickel' (JLB), reflects on a past relationship, describing it as his \"greatest heartache\" and his \"greatest love.\" He struggles with the pain of their separation, trying to suppress the memories. He expresses uncertainty about her true feelings, wondering if she loved him as deeply as he loved her. Despite the pain, he wishes her happiness and will always love her. He recently moved to Milton, hinting at a potential fresh start.\n\nSeeking immediate gratification, I find myself in a state of heightened arousal over the past few days, with no successful recourse to alleviate it. I am yearning for intimate relations. However, a minor impediment presents itself: I am currently in the early stages of my monthly cycle, which, while not prominent, may potentially deter some. I am aware that this could be a deterrent, but I believe that, given its mild nature, it may not be noticeable. I am a student, with a bust size of x and lips that have been complimented. If you are a man under the age of x, and the aforementioned factor does not bother you, I invite you to reach out. Please include a photograph with your response. As I do not have a vehicle, I would appreciate it if you could arrange transportation. I am serious about my intentions for tonight and am indeed genuine, so please do not inquire about my authenticity. It is currently Tuesday, x : x pm, and the weather earlier today was sunny. I am looking for someone in the same age range, residing in the same county. Let us engage in some enjoyable activities tonight, specifically, sexual intimacy.\n\nSeeking casual encounters in the Soldotna area, a mature woman is desired for a platonic friendship, involving evening walks with our dogs. I'm heading to a social gathering tonight and could use some companionship. If interested, please respond via email with a photograph for identification. I'll be delighted to extend a drink on me. Ladies only, please. Additionally, I'm seeking a cuddle buddy for a sleepover, with no sexual expectations. We could enjoy a movie and some drinks to ease into the evening. Meanwhile, in Portland, Oregon, a gentleman is searching for a long-term relationship, free from deceit and games. He enjoys various activities, including sports events and theater, and is looking for genuine connection, even if it starts with a simple conversation about the weather. Lastly, a curious individual is wondering about the experiences of women who have been with another woman, and is open to exploring this topic further.\n\nWith the exception of Sunday mornings, which are dedicated to intimate encounters and a Saturday golf lesson, my schedule is open for beach strolls, weather permitting, or indoor sports like billiards on rainy days. As a public relations professional based in New York City, I possess a strong wanderlust and a penchant for engaging in captivating experiences. I am currently unattached, having never been married or in a long-term relationship. I am drawn to single men, with a preference for younger individuals. My ideal partner is tall, has wavy hair, and possesses a keen sense of style, with roots tracing back to 'Northern' Europe. I am an avid fan of the NY Rangers and NY Yankees, and I am particularly fond of Sandra Bullock's performances. Recent cinematic favorites include 'Legally Blonde' and the sing-along version of 'Mama Mia'. While I enjoy dancing to various music genres, it is not a prerequisite for my partners. I am attracted to professional men with advanced degrees who are either making a significant impact or aspire to do so. Given my own work ethic, I appreciate individuals who are actively engaged in the world. I am eager to connect with like-minded individuals who share my interests and values, regardless of their location.\n\nIn a separate encounter, I encountered a charming cashier named Sam at a local eatery, who left a lasting impression with their striking beauty and allure. As an African-American femme, I am seeking a nonsmoking partner of the same gender for chemistry, compatibility, and friendship. I am open to a variety of activities, including outdoor pursuits, family time, and travel. I am not interested in butch/stud types, married individuals, or those with explicit sexual intentions. I am simply looking to forge new friendships and enjoy each other's company over dinner, outings, or other social engagements, without any sexual expectations. As a single father from Fargo, North Dakota, I find myself yearning for the companionship and engaging conversations that I once shared with a woman.\n\nCurrently seeking intimate encounters, specifically with an Asian woman who would be open to performing oral sex on me. I am equipped with a x-inch penis and assure a mutually satisfying experience, particularly if you find pleasure in pleasuring a man. I am interested in facial or breast cumshot scenarios. Inquiries from serious parties only, please. Additionally, I am seeking a thick, white female companion to join me for a casual beer and poolside relaxation. I am simply looking to spend time together and see where the evening takes us. If interested, please send photographs and include your age in the subject line. I am a x-year-old male with long hair and tattoos. Recently, I attended a The Weeknd concert and have concluded my high school journey. I am now seeking female friends without the drama, preferably around the age of 29, based in Buffalo, NY.", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "1fab7362-307a-4486-9709-be8997b05287", "url": "http://kimxgensapa.com/South_dakota/Covington-Kentucky-sex-hook-up/29791/Peterborough-lady-for-fun-in-Peterborough/Jenifer"}

{"text": "On March 24, 2016, the country music duo Love and Theft, previously known for their hit \"Angel Eyes,\" inked a deal with Curb Records. This marks their third label change, having previously been associated with a Lyric Street subsidiary and RCA. For their latest album, \"Whiskey On My Breath,\" they chose to go independent, adopting a softer sound and co-producing with veteran musician Josh Leo. The album's title track was released as the lead single to country radio.\n\nReflecting on their decision to release the album independently, Eric Gunderson, one half of the duo, stated, \"We saw an opportunity to deliver a record that truly represented us as artists. By signing with Curb, another independent company, we maintain our artistic integrity while benefiting from their expertise.\"\n\nJim Ed Norman, CEO of The Curb Group, expressed his enthusiasm about the signing, \"We're thrilled to welcome Love and Theft to the Curb Records family. It's a privilege to work with such talented artists, and having the support of Vector Management and producer Josh Leo makes this collaboration even more exciting.\"\n\nStephen Barker Liles, the other member of the duo, echoed Norman's sentiments, \"We're honored to be signed to Curb Records.

{"text": "Manchester United could provide relief to Chelsea's discontented outcast, Juan Mata, who is growing increasingly frustrated with his limited playing time. The latest chapter in Mata's Chelsea saga unfolded on New Year's Day, as he reacted petulantly to being substituted against Southampton while the score remained nil-nil. Predictably, this sparked queries from the press to Chelsea manager José Mourinho about Mata's future at the club, with the January transfer window on the horizon. Mourinho's response put several top European clubs on high alert, as he asserted that he did not wish to sell the diminutive playmaker but would consider it if Mata expressed a desire to leave. Given the upcoming World Cup and Mata's understandable frustration at his limited pitch time—he has started only nine Premier League games this season—speculation about his future is rife. In keeping with the annual mid-season transfer frenzy, Ladbrokes has opened betting on players' destinations by February 1, with Mata among the listed names. Manchester United manager David Moyes, who previously sought a creative midfielder without success, may renew his pursuit in January, given his side's seventh-place league standing and 11-point gap behind leaders Arsenal. It is notable that defending champions Manchester United are priced similarly to Arsenal, despite the latter's significant summer investment in Mesut Özil and well-stocked midfield.", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "add43973-5bc0-4040-8fc1-72b71edb0f2d", "url": "http://news.ladbrokes.com/football/premier-league/man-united-to-rescue-unhappy-chelsea-misfit-from-the-doldrums.html"}

{"text": "In the Iowa town of La Porte City, authorities are pursuing a fresh lead in the case of a missing teenager with mild autism, while also appealing to the public for assistance. Black Hawk County Sheriff, Tony Thompson, voiced his discontent on Saturday, following a previous appeal for photographs taken on the day Jake Wilson, 16, was last seen.\n\nOn Friday evening, investigators received several new leads, including one that they deemed \"intriguing\" and are currently pursuing. The sheriff's office is urging anyone who might have spotted an individual walking near the intersection of Commercial Street and Bishop Avenue around 8:30 PM on April 7 to come forward. Wilson was last seen at 9 PM that night, embarking on a walk in the town of approximately 2,200 residents. Local law enforcement began searching for him by 10 PM, and since then, hundreds of volunteers have joined the effort. However, as the search enters its seventh day, morale among the search crews is waning.\n\nThe FBI has established a website where individuals can submit tips and upload any photographs taken in La Porte City on the day Wilson disappeared. However, investigators report that the number of images submitted so far is disappointingly low. On Friday, Thompson humorously remarked that the website was a response to residents' demands, not mere suggestions. On Saturday, his tone was more serious.\n\n\"I must be honest with you,\" he said, \"I'm quite frustrated that we haven't had more uploads, and that engagement has been low.\"\n\nAuthorities believe that a significant number of photographs were taken that day due to a family reunion and a bike ride in the area. Thompson expressed his team's determination to remain optimistic about reuniting Wilson with his family. However, he hinted that Saturday's developments could lead to one of two outcomes: either the case would be resolved, and everyone could go home, or they would discuss how the investigation would need to adapt moving forward.\n\nAt this critical juncture, Thompson cautioned, the most adverse development would be a decline in public interest regarding the issue. \"We acknowledge our community's remarkable resilience; they swiftly move on, but this is not a situation we intend to let slip from their consciousness,\" he asserted. \"I pledged to the family from the outset that we are committed until the very end, until the conclusion.\"\n\nBlack Hawk County Sheriff Tony Thompson addressed reporters on Thursday afternoon, discussing the ongoing search for 16-year-old Jake Wilson, who had been missing since the preceding Saturday night. \"We want you to come home,\" he echoed, his voice laden with concern.\n\nIn a written communiqué, the Wilson family expressed their gratitude to the community for their support thus far and implored them to continue aiding investigators. A family friend, Chris Taylor, delivered the statement at a press conference on Saturday, her voice trembling with emotion. She enumerated several reasons why the family takes immense pride in their son, highlighting his tenacity in winning Special Olympics awards and his participation in choirs, while also emphasizing his shared experiences with other youngsters in the community.\n\nThe letter detailed Wilson's fondness for exploring nature, his penchant for fishing, and his habit of collecting trinkets from his small adventures. As is well-known in the town, he harbors a particular affection for ice cream. \"As he grew, he exhibited peculiar behaviors, akin to those associated with autism,\" the statement read. \"Yet, with the backing of family, friends, and the benevolent people of this community, Jake flourished despite these challenges.\"\n\nThe family's appeal to their neighbors concluded with a heartfelt plea: \"Jake, we love you. And we want you to come home.\"\n\nSearch and rescue teams from various agencies across Black Hawk County persevered in their search for 16-year-old Jake Wilson on Friday, April 13, 2018, in La Porte City. Wilson had gone missing the previous Saturday after embarking on a solitary walk.\n\nOn Saturday, the search for Wilson resumed, with approximately 50 volunteers, including some in kayaks and others in protective gear, resuming their efforts from where they had left off at Wolf Creek the previous day. Despite the inclement weather, which included rain and occasional light hail, the group diligently removed logjams obstructing the creek, facilitating the deployment of sonar equipment to map the water's surface. La Porte City's police chief, Chris Brecher, stated that their current focus is on systematically checking the waterway to eliminate it as a potential location for Wilson. Despite their fatigue, the search team remains optimistic, with a positive attitude prevailing among its members. 'All we can do,' Brecher remarked, 'is to search methodically, clear the area effectively, and take solace in knowing that we are doing everything in our power.'\n\nMeanwhile, the family of Jake, who has been missing for a week, expressed their heartfelt gratitude for the overwhelming support they have received during this extraordinarily challenging time. 'We love Jake,' they said, 'and we long for him to be back home with us.' They shared some insights about Jake, highlighting that while he may appear to be a typical teenager, he has faced challenges since birth due to a mild intellectual disorder, and has exhibited behaviors reminiscent of autism. Despite these obstacles, Jake has flourished with the support of his family, friends, and the community, excelling in sports and music, particularly in choir. Like many teenagers, Jake is also an avid gamer, with a particular fondness for Xbox. His love for nature is evident in his enjoyment of fishing and collecting various treasures, such as antlers and empty shells, during his outdoor adventures. Jake's favorite chore is feeding the chickens, and he takes great pleasure in visiting his uncle Chad and aunt Mel's farm, where he delights in collecting turkey or chicken eggs and feathers from the coup.\n\nJake harbors a particular fondness for the town park and the recreational activity of swinging. In response to his enthusiasm, we constructed a swing set in our backyard. Jake's affection for ice cream is equally pronounced. He finds joy in simply being himself, and in turn, we cherish him more than words can express.\n\n\"We eagerly await Jake's return. Our gratitude towards everyone involved in facilitating this outcome is immense, leaving us at a loss for adequate words. During this challenging period, we implore the media, volunteers, and community members to assist us in gathering any information that could aid in locating him.\n\n\"Jake, our love for you is boundless, and we long for your safe return. Once more, our heartfelt thanks to everyone for their unwavering support.", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "6a326abb-9ca1-43ca-bb6c-9955a754c907", "url": "http://www.autisminthenews.ca/blog/investigators-follow-new-lead-in-the-disappearance-of-autistic-la-porte-city-teen-jake-wilson"}

This collection is wonderfully heavy and has a charming distressed antique look, making it perfect for both everyday use and as a treasured heirloom to be passed down through generations.\n\nI am curious to hear if anyone else has come across any notable pewter finds, as it seems to be regaining popularity.", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "c70e557f-59d6-4023-83a2-46769b9734a4", "url": "https://www.heirloomedcollection.com/heirloomedblog/tag/silverware"}

This fusion results in enhanced comfort and timeless style when adorned with throw pillows.\n\nThis arrangement comprises a single, left-arm sofa, two armless sofa sets, and a corner sofa, providing ample seating capacity for friends and family. The upholstery, crafted entirely from rayon, ensures both comfort and longevity. The key advantage lies in the flexibility to mix and match seating configurations within the room, creating a harmonious layout that can even accommodate smaller spaces.

The classic Lawson also boasts a higher back and cushion edges adorned with welting, mirroring the back pillows. Originally commissioned by American copper magnate Jones Lawson in the late 19th century, this sofa was designed to deviate from the elaborate Victorian styles prevalent at the time. Modern interpretations of the Lawson may incorporate wood or metal accents in the arms, while the sofa's versatility lies in its ability to adopt different aesthetics based on the chosen upholstery fabric. It can exude glamour, elegance, or casual charm, depending on the fabric's nature.\n\nThe Tiago Indoor/Outdoor Lumbar Pillow by Rennie & Rose Design Group offers a versatile seating experience, with materials ranging from linen to velvet. Its sophisticated color palette, encompassing shades like Marzipan, Stoneware (Light Tan), and Rye (Dark Brown), allows for customization to suit various room styles.

Its adorable shape and sweet color options make it an ideal choice for children's spaces, providing a cozy nook for storytime or daydreaming. Adults, too, can enjoy its comfort, whether for a quiet read or a late-night movie marathon.\n\nWhen selecting furniture for the living room, leather is often an astute choice. Its versatility in complementing various styles, coupled with exceptional durability (ideal for households with children or pets) and ease of maintenance, makes it a compelling option. However, the primary drawback of leather is its typically higher cost compared to fabric, microfiber, or synthetic leather alternatives. This reclining loveseat, nonetheless, presents a cost-effective solution by employing a hybrid approach: the seating area is upholstered in genuine leather, while the back and arms are covered with more affordable synthetic leather. This design allows you to enjoy the appearance and feel of a full leather loveseat at a reduced cost. The loveseat's lever mechanism enables you to recline comfortably on its high-density foam filling, while you consider the savings. Furthermore, this piece comes with an added advantage: professional assembly is available in multiple locations across the country at an additional charge.", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "09d0a97a-e4b8-407c-b5e6-a89a137dab91", "url": "http://utgem.co/furn-Outdoor-Lounge-Chairs/467-select-roberson-outdoor-mesh-chaise-lounge-set-of-4--by-orren-ellis-2019-04-16-5juk62zo9laxly9.shtml"}

{"text": "Streamlined Home Dumpster Rental in West Newton, MA\nObtain a complimentary quotation by calling today!\nSeeking residential dumpster rental services in West Newton?\nHomeDumpster.net caters to both commercial and residential needs, offering an extensive range of dumpster sizes at competitive prices.\nDumpster rentals provide businesses with a cost-effective and convenient solution for waste management, eliminating the need for purchasing or maintaining their own disposal units. Rental companies offer diverse disposal unit types tailored to specific waste requirements, and the unit's lifespan is not a concern for short-term needs.\nAvoid the hassle of waiting for community waste pick-up by renting a dumpster. Enjoy next-day delivery by placing your order online or calling the evening before. Save time and effort by disposing of waste promptly and avoiding the need for sorting recyclables and packing trash into bags.\n\nThe leased dumpster accommodates a variety of disposables, including heavy items such as mattresses. Hotels undergoing renovations can benefit from renting one or more large dumpsters to discard multiple mattresses. The dumpster's wheels facilitate easy relocation, ensuring user convenience.\n\nWe often accumulate substantial amounts of clutter over time, leading to significant disorganization in our homes and lives. If your New Year's resolution involves decluttering, consider the following tips to initiate the process.\n\nTo select an appropriately sized dumpster, assess the scale of your project. Overestimating your needs may be prudent to avoid additional fees for overfilling, which could exceed the cost of renting a larger container.\n\nIf you inhabit a residence built in the 1980s, you might be contemplating a modern update, as the definition of'modern' has evolved significantly since then.\n\nIn West Newton, MA, residential dumpster rentals play a crucial role in substantial renovation projects. By renting these oversized waste receptacles, you can streamline the cleaning and disposal process, preventing waste accumulation and maintaining a pleasant environment.\n\nNext Day Dumpster Rentals simplify household projects in West Newton, making waste management more efficient and convenient.\n\nEmployment of dumpster rentals during significant undertakings, such as development projects, can foster a secure and clean work environment for employees, thereby mitigating potential hazards and accidents. The accumulation of unmanaged waste on-site can increase the likelihood of such incidents, while prompt disposal and management of construction debris can help alleviate potential financial liabilities stemming from work-related injuries.\n\nWhile the cost of renting a dumpster is undeniable, it is crucial to consider the potential savings it can offer. Businesses often opt for dumpsters due to their efficiency in handling large volumes of waste. However, their role in mitigating financial risks is often overlooked. Here are three ways dumpsters can help save money during large-scale projects:\n\n1. Efficient Waste Management: Placing the dumpster in a designated, accessible area facilitates seamless pick-up and delivery, ensuring no obstacles are posed to the truck driver. It is advisable to familiarize oneself with the dimensions of the dumpster before its arrival to streamline the process for both the customer and the vendor.\n\n2. Cost-Effective Solutions: It can be challenging to determine the optimal dumpster size to meet specific needs. Dumpster rentals are typically charged based on the volume of waste, rental duration, and dumpster size. Utilizing a small dumpster may result in additional charges due to multiple pick-ups, while a large dumpster may lead to wasted space. Many rental companies, such as those offering Residential Dumpster Rental in West Newton, address this by providing various dumpster sizes to cater to individual requirements.\n\n3. Risk Mitigation: By ensuring timely and efficient waste disposal, the likelihood of accidents and subsequent medical costs can be significantly reduced, thereby mitigating potential financial burdens.\n\nOne critical aspect to consider is the ease of support offered. It is essential to ensure that the service maintains a substantial fleet of vehicles, each capable of transporting a wide range of waste materials. Various dumpster styles are available to accommodate large volumes of waste, including 3-5 yard, 6-8 yard, 10-15 yard, 20 yard, 30 yard, and 45 yard dumpsters, providing customers with the flexibility to choose the most suitable size for their needs.\n\nA more recent trend, gaining traction in the current market, is the bundling or pairing of services by event companies. Often, a single vendor offers multiple temporary rental services crucial for the success of events such as concerts, weddings, parties, or other celebrations. This trend is particularly evident in the dumpster rental market. Historically, residential dumpster rental companies in West Newton primarily focused on waste management services. However, many now also offer dumpster and roll-off rental services, often with integrated recycling and scrap metal processing facilities, and even provide residential junk collection services.\n\nOne significant factor underscoring the necessity of a Residential Dumpster Rental in West Newton is the substantial volume of waste generated, particularly in residential construction. Even a typical household can produce up to 9 tons of waste, with materials like drywall, old furniture, and shingles contributing more than one might expect, often exceeding the capacity of regular waste management systems. The affordability and convenience of dumpster rentals, which can be delivered and picked up at the job site, make waste management a crucial aspect of project planning for most contractors. Overlooking this step can lead to unwanted headaches for homeowners. Dumpster rentals alleviate the burden of dealing with permits and legalities associated with large-scale waste disposal. Moreover, with the ease of delivery and removal, using dumpsters is often the most cost-effective method for waste removal. Some dumpster rental services even offer to remove waste from the job site for an additional fee, or even for free, depending on the type of waste produced. Many construction projects fail to utilize these facilities, leading to unnecessary paperwork and delays. Engaging with a local Residential Dumpster Rental in West Newton company can thus provide substantial benefits, as each business offers unique services tailored to specific waste management needs.\n\nSpecialized assistance involving Residential Dumpster Rental in West Newton, MA often encompasses communal cleaning initiatives and other philanthropic projects. Typically, dumpster companies collaborate with event coordinators, frequently offering discounts to support these community endeavors. This approach sets these professional waste management services apart and establishes them as a go-to solution for dumpster needs.\n\nTo initiate your Residential Dumpster Rental in West Newton, MA, consider the following steps:\n\n1. Property Cleanups: From overgrown yards to storm damage debris, sometimes the volume of waste exceeds individual handling capacity. Dumpster services provide a convenient solution for disposing of yard waste, including leaves, trees, lumber, and excess soil.\n\nAs spring approaches, southeastern residents brace for its charming days and disruptive weather patterns, such as heavy winds, rain, hail, tornadoes, and late snowfalls. These storms can leave behind significant messes, posing challenges for cleanup. Here are some strategies to help restore your neighborhood:\n\n2. Basement Clearouts: Basements can pose a significant challenge, requiring a Residential Dumpster Rental in West Newton, MA. Whether you're disposing of long-accumulated junk or renovating your attic, a next-day dumpster rental is crucial for completing the task efficiently.\n\nWhen faced with substantial waste management needs, consider dumpster rental as a viable solution. This could be particularly useful when planning large-scale events, undergoing major demolition projects, or dealing with the aftermath of a significant life change such as a parent's illness or passing. In these situations, a dumpster can provide a convenient and efficient means of waste disposal, eliminating the need for multiple trips to the dump. For instance, if you're clearing out a property filled with years of accumulated belongings, a dumpster can help you sort through and dispose of unwanted items, allowing you to keep and cherish sentimental pieces while discarding the rest. Similarly, when undertaking a bathroom renovation, renting a dumpster can help keep the project on schedule by providing a dedicated space for construction debris.", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "53faa66a-5b03-45c4-97d1-b3fd4d068b36", "url": "http://www.homedumpster.net/massachusetts/residential-dumpster-rental-west-newton-ma/"}

{"text": "On March 3rd, the funeral of T.I.'s eldest sister, Precious Harris, took place. Harris, whose real name was Antoinette Chapman, had been involved in a motor vehicle accident on February 15th in southwest Atlanta. While driving a 2013 Dodge Avenger with her granddaughter, Kair, in the passenger seat, she suffered an asthma attack and collided with a telephone pole. Upon arrival at an Atlanta hospital, Harris was unconscious but still breathing. A week later, her daughter, Kamaya, announced her passing on social media, expressing her grief: 'From my best friend on earth to my beautiful angel in heaven... Mama girl, I'm gonna miss you... I love you so much. I'm so heartbroken, but the peace you found this past week confirms you're at rest, no more asthma attacks. Damn, but baby, I'm gonna miss you.' T.I. also paid tribute to his sister on Instagram a few days after her death.\n\n\"Our collective hearts brim with affection, nostalgia, and gratitude for your unwavering love, service, and lifelong commitment to us. While we rejoice in your well-deserved release from earthly struggles, finding solace in the knowledge that you've earned your eternal rest, we can't help but mourn your departure. Yet, we must honor your legacy by celebrating your life and finding joy in your newfound peace. Your teachings, wise words, and cherished memories will forever endure. Please extend our greetings to your loved ones; we eagerly await our reunion. Until then, farewell, dear sister.\"\n\nTiny Harris, wife of rapper T.I., paid tribute to her late sister-in-law, expressing the family's grief while celebrating her life. She wrote, \"The next two days will be challenging, but we take comfort in knowing you're at peace, looking radiant. We'll miss your joy, but we'll treasure the life you led and the precious moments we shared.\"\n\nOn Saturday, the Harris family and friends gathered to bid their final farewells to the 66-year-old in a joyous celebration at the Salem Bible Church in Atlanta. The service featured live performances by T.I. and his son, King Harris. Notable attendees included Toya Wright, Shekinah Jo, Xscape, Keke Wyatt, and Atlanta's Mayor, Keisha Bottoms.", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "342b904e-da0e-4de8-8a82-5271f3fb379a", "url": "https://thejasminebrand.com/2019/03/03/t-i-s-sister-precious-harris-laid-to-rest-video/"}

{"text": "Over the past decade, I have frequently visited South Beach, staying at numerous beachfront hotels, particularly those offering stunning views. I am an avid fan of the Green Monkey for yoga and DIRT for brunch. In the past, my then-boyfriend and I stayed at Nobu Hotel, but our initial experience was less than ideal due to overcrowding and understaffing, exacerbated by snowstorms in the Northeast that grounded many travelers.\n\nDespite this, we made the most of our stay, as it was the weekend we got engaged. Post-visit, I sent a brief email to the management expressing my concerns, and received a prompt, personal response. Since then, we have returned to Nobu multiple times, and Nigel llobregat has consistently gone above and beyond to ensure our stays are exceptional, from making dinner and spa reservations to offering room recommendations and securing the best available rates.\n\nIn today's customer service landscape, marked by the influence of social media, it can be challenging for any business to excel. However, I believe Nobu genuinely cares about its customers' experiences and has consistently strived to improve our stays. This is why we continue to return, typically arriving on Thursday nights and kicking off our visits with dinner at Nobu. I must also mention the hotel's incredible spa.\n\nLast week, we stayed at the Nobu Hotel and thoroughly enjoyed our time. The accommodation was aesthetically pleasing, with a subtle Asian influence that created a calming atmosphere. Our ocean-facing room, complete with a balcony, offered a tranquil setting, especially at sunrise. Although the pool area was bustling, we secured chairs by rising early. Our server, Amanda, provided excellent service, while Raul D in reservations was particularly helpful and charming. He patiently addressed our numerous queries, ensuring we secured a suitable package that included daily breakfast. His pleasant demeanor made the process enjoyable. We intend to return, given the exceptional experience.\n\nIn stark contrast, a subsequent review on TripAdvisor, dated July 20th, 2019, painted a different picture. The reviewer found the hotel overcrowded, with one pool closed and shared with the Eden Roc. The lack of disclosure about these conditions during booking was a point of contention. The reviewer also criticized the pool's security measures, which included bag checks and a ban on outside food and drinks, even water. The reviewer found the pricing at Malibu Farms, the on-site restaurant, exorbitant for the quality of food served, with instances of undercooked dishes and hygiene issues.\n\nBeware of the online portrayal of tranquility and luxury; seek accommodation elsewhere in Miami for a more satisfactory experience. Having frequented South Beach for both business and leisure, I regretfully recount my sole visit to the Nobu Hotel, an upscale annex of the subpar Eden Roc. The amenities, shared with Eden Roc, fell short of the zen, high-end ambiance I anticipated. The pool area was overcrowded, with limited seating and a lack of opening hours for the Nobu pool. Moreover, the service was inadequate, with recently hired staff who seemed ill-equipped for their roles. The atmosphere was questionable, with pool security struggling to maintain order. After a lengthy wait, ice was delivered in a plastic bag, without an ice bucket or pen and paper in the room. While I look forward to future trips to South Beach, I will certainly not return to this establishment. There is no compelling reason to revisit this hotel.\n\nThe hotel was an exquisite haven, replete with artistic masterpieces and architectural marvels. The most memorable aspect of my journey was undoubtedly the breakfast experience, which commenced with a warm welcome from Elisha and Victor at the entrance, and culminated in impeccable service from Pierre and Nathan at the table. As a first-time visitor to Miami, I was captivated by the city's rich cultural tapestry, which was reflected in the culinary delights I encountered. The fruit I savored at the hotel was, without a doubt, the finest I have ever tasted. The squid pasta at Nobu and the vegetable pizza at Malibu Farm were equally remarkable. As a self-proclaimed epicurean, I wholeheartedly endorse Nobu Eden Roc for any food enthusiasts seeking an exceptional dining experience.", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "2a34b11c-30c6-4fc4-a758-d74422c0b4c1", "url": "https://travel.usnews.com/Hotels/review-Nobu_Hotel_Miami_Beach-Miami_Beach-Florida-150279/guest-reviews/"}

{"text": "As the year draws to a close, it is customary to reflect upon our achievements and ask, \"Have we accomplished what we set out to do this year?\" The year 2014, in retrospect, has been a journey of personal growth and self-discovery. As we evolve and uncover facets of ourselves we never knew existed, we find ourselves questioning, \"Are we doing enough? Are we being enough?\"\n\nI recall the early days of our foray into the digital realm, a time when maintaining a fan site was not as straightforward as it is today. The emergence of the Twilight saga was a turning point; we were unaware that our lives would be forever altered. As we chronicled the cast's every move, we were oblivious to the transformative power of our actions. Initially timid bloggers eager to please, we grew into individuals willing to challenge conventions, regardless of the consequences.\n\nIt seems like only yesterday that we were rubbing shoulders with celebrities on the red carpet for the premiere of \"Breaking Dawn - Part 2,\" leaving the world wondering about our identities, alongside our comrades from \"That's Normal.\" We were poised to make a grand exit, and indeed, we did. However, this was also a period of transition, as we at \"Twilightish\" and our counterparts at \"That's Normal\" were both evolving from our humble beginnings, hoping to find a satisfying conclusion to our journeys. I daresay we have grown into individuals we can be proud of, and we wouldn't have it any other way.\n\nYou might wonder why you see content from \"That's Normal\" in our timeline. The answer is simple: they are our closest friends, our partners in this chaotic world of blogging. We support each other, and they support us.\n\nThe truth is, this industry is fiercely competitive and ruthless. We have weathered numerous storms, engaged in heated battles with other blogs, and emerged stronger or weaker, depending on the situation. However, every experience has been a learning opportunity, one that we would not trade for anything in the world.\n\nIn recent times, we've found ourselves in a position of weakness, an outcome not of our own making. However, we refrain from discussing the intricacies of what transpired. We acknowledge the Teen Wolf community's frustration, but I assure you, our affection for them remains steadfast. We shall emerge from this stronger, with more insights to share and actions to undertake. Our commitment to you is unwavering, yet we offer a fresh perspective, one we are content to embrace.\n\nWe accept the ebb and flow of life, for every event, whether desired or not, carries a lesson. We understand this, and thus, our approach for the coming month is to continue navigating our path, growing, and heeding your voices.\n\nThis period also entails extensive writing. We are engaged in National Novel Writing Month (NaNoWriMo), another narrative, and several short stories inspired by fandoms. These stories, while based on true events, will have altered names and fandoms to protect those involved. After all, safeguarding sources and memories is paramount. You can find these works on our Wattpad profile.\n\nNovember also heralds the release of 'Mockingjay', a bittersweet moment as we bid farewell to 'The Hunger Games' series. These films have left an indelible mark on us, shaping our personal lives in profound ways, though we are unable to elaborate further. We cherish the joy and wisdom they have bestowed upon us.\n\nAs we navigate this month of uncertainty and transition, I leave you with this: at the close of each day, we shall remain by your side. As ever, I am here to assist you whenever needed.\n\nWarm regards,\n\nErin\nerin@fangirlish.com", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "bc776f4e-9231-4329-a542-c539716ccca6", "url": "http://fangirlish.com/letters-from-fangirlish-novembers-reflections/"}

{"text": "Home / Online Dating / Unveiling the Insights: The Elusive Best Online Dating Services\nUnveiling the Insights: The Elusive Best Online Dating Services\nUnveiling the Insights: The Elusive Best Online Dating Services\nYou might be contemplating which platform is worth your time and money, or if online dating is even for you. Rest assured, there's an online dating site tailored to you. Thus, before delving into the quest for the best online dating site, reflect on your intentions and preferences in online relationships.\nMany users browse these sites briefly, but one site stands out: Ave Maria Singles. Most contemporary platforms boast user-friendly interfaces and responsive customer support.\nTo discern the best options, compile a list of top sites and compare their features. While many sites come and go, the following five have stood the test of time, each offering unique services based on your relationship goals, from casual friendships to committed partnerships. They employ advanced emotional matching algorithms. However, some users may prefer a broader, more general dating site with a larger pool of potential matches, and the perfect site for you may lie therein.\n\nThe webpage boasts a multitude of options and enjoys a substantial user base, hence its position as our third most recommended website. While you are encouraged to explore as many free dating sites as you wish, we suggest considering at least two premium options, as these tend to attract individuals more committed to finding a serious, long-term relationship. Dating platforms should prioritize user experience and matchmaking. It is essential to note that online dating is not solely about finding love; some users may simply be seeking casual encounters. The primary advantage of joining any dating website is the increased likelihood of meeting a compatible partner. Opting for the largest and most popular site with a robust personal ads feature could significantly improve one's chances of finding that perfect match. Some websites cater to specific demographics based on background or faith, while others offer a more diverse user base. Additionally, some users may join with the intention of finding a life partner or significant other, while others may feel overwhelmed by the sheer number of options available.\n\nOne can observe that the individual is currently active, having logged in recently. The platform permits users to refine their matches using basic information, though it may not always facilitate a straightforward search. While presenting oneself favorably online is desirable, an outdated profile picture, particularly one taken years ago, may not serve one's interests when it comes to meeting potential partners. Communication, predominantly through chatting, is integral to online dating, as it provides a primary means to interact and assess compatibility. Ideally, online dating should be an enjoyable and positive experience, with many now considering it a common and expected practice. Many contemporary dating sites cater to users' preferences, making it easier for them to find suitable matches. However, it is important to note the prevalence of scams online, which can be challenging to avoid entirely.\n\nThe website in question offers its users a straightforward interface, facilitating open and swift communication with other profiles. It is worth noting that not all dating sites cater to the same types of individuals, and thus, not every platform may be suited to everyone's needs.\n\nWhile it's not advisable to sign up for just any website that catches your eye, finding the most suitable one for your romantic pursuits is crucial. Firstly, ensure the platform does not expose your personal data, including your email. When using the recommended dating sites below, exercise caution as you may encounter fake profiles and individuals with ulterior motives. To commence your search, consider the type of partner you're seeking and your personal values when choosing a platform. If you're aiming to join the best dating service, several factors may influence your decision. Initially, you'll need to pay the registration fee to sign up for a reputable dating website.", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "f5ce262a-77ea-4aa3-aeda-771780e3b1f7", "url": "http://shopelectronicsandmore.frity.cf/unusual-article-offers-you-the-important-points-on-87/"}

Rap enthusiasts will also appreciate the song's intricate tapping segment. This track is undoubtedly deserving of a top ten spot.\"\n\n\"RedOne's compositional prowess is evident in 'Pound the Alarm'. Its house influences and Minaj's raps make it a standout track, though its chart performance may not reflect its quality. All of Minaj's work is impressive, but this song is particularly notable.\"\n\n\"'Pound the Alarm' is a chart-topping, catchy track that showcases Minaj's versatility. Its Rio-inspired style, striking lyrics, and fashion elements make it a fan favorite.\"\n\n\"Some critics may dismiss 'Pound the Alarm' as overproduced and repetitive, but its widespread appeal and Minaj's unique style are undeniable.\"\n\n\"'Moment 4 Life', featuring Drake, is a standout track that highlights Minaj's collaborative prowess. Fans appreciate its timeless feel, memorable chorus, and impressive lyrics from both artists. While Minaj has many hits, this song is often cited as a classic.\"\n\n\"Minaj's influence is evident in her fans' admiration for her work. 'Moment 4 Life' remains a favorite among her devoted followers, who praise its enduring appeal and Minaj's status as the 'queen of rap'.\"\n\nThe lyrics are remarkable... \"I am not a word, I am not a line; I am not a woman who can ever be categorized; I am not flight, I am levitation; I embody an entire generation.\"\nGiven that we have a commendable Nicky Minaj track for once, why the continued complaints? Moreover, Rihanna's fame is indeed built upon her music. - DaisyandRosalina\nIn one word, the song \"SMOOTHY\" is \"Enchanting.\"\nWell-done, team! Please cast your votes.\nThis is, without a doubt, the best song ever.\n- 22 Comments\n- 7Va: \"Va Va Voom\" - \"It's simply outstanding.

Great lyrics and amazing vocals.\"\n- I80: \"So, she does possess talent.\"\n- Her most emotionally engaging songs ever. This track can evoke tears, surprisingly, from Nicki, and now it's everything to me.\n- 17 Comments\n- 9Roman's Revenge: \"I honestly doubted that a Nicki Minaj and Eminem collaboration would work, given their different styles, but they have chemistry, and it made the song successful. Good flows too.\"\n- AlphaQ: \"I love Eminem's verses in this song; it's her best and most addictive song besides 'Super Bass'. Nicki Minaj and Eminem work great together!\" - keshaluvr\n\nThe track's potency, bolstered by Eminem's addition, sees her vanquish all adversaries, making it a standout, albeit often overlooked, gem. This piece is the album's cornerstone, a triumph in its entirety. Comments laud its prowess, with one user, \"10Pills N Potions,\" appreciating Nicki Minaj's fresh, unadorned persona and the anti-drug message, complemented by exceptional flow and smooth lyrics. Another user finds Minaj's humility in the song refreshing, a departure from her previous, more ostentatious tracks. The song's emotional depth, exploring themes of anger and love, resonates with listeners, marking a powerful album opener. Fans express their admiration, with \"mykaela\" praising Minaj's consistent improvement. \"Beez in the Trap,\" another popular track, is hailed for its coolness and Minaj's captivating presence, with some users comparing it favorably to other hits like \"Super Bass.\" Meanwhile, \"The Night Is Still Young\" is praised for its enjoyable, retro Pink Friday vibes, leaving listeners eager for more. Lastly, \"Check It Out\" is deemed the album's apex, a high point that sets it apart.\n\nAmong her discography, this particular track holds a special place in my heart, one that I believe deserves wider appreciation. Its unique qualities have the potential to captivate even the most discerning listeners. In the event that one finds it lacking, I would encourage a second listen, as it may grow on them over time. This piece is, in my opinion, a standout in her repertoire, a sentiment echoed by many others who have taken the time to comment on its merits. Its slow tempo and poignant lyrics have been described as addictive, with some likening it to a'slow poison' that seeps into one's consciousness. The consensus among fans is that this song is a testament to her versatility as an artist, with its simple yet effective beat and a message that resonates deeply. Some have even gone so far as to suggest that it is one of her best works to date, surpassing even her more popular hits. Despite the competition from her extensive discography, this track remains a fan favorite, with some even advocating for it to be ranked among her top songs. Its emotional depth and Minaj's raw vocals have been praised, with some viewers even suggesting that it should be considered among the best songs of all time.\n\n35? This track is exceptional, it deserves a higher position. This song needs to rank higher! Wait, but I believe this is one of Nicki Minaj's finest works, I can't seem to get enough of it! It should certainly be in the top 10! The beat is truly impressive.\n\nComments:\n- '21HOV Lane' praises the song, \"This track is awesome!\"\n- 'Side to Side' argues against the song's inclusion, as Nicki Minaj is only featured, with Ariana Grande being the primary artist, - DrayTopTens.\n- 'Best song eeevveer' and 'Best song eeever' express their admiration.\n- '23Bang Bang' appreciates the collaboration between Nicki Minaj and Ariana Grande, likening it to 'Bang Bang' and 'Side Too Side'.\n- A user provides reasons for both liking and disliking the song, appreciating the catchy beat, rap, and Nicki Minaj's contribution, while criticizing the beat's similarity to 'Baby Got Back', the use of lyrics from other songs, and the focus on buttocks.\n- Another user strongly condemns the song, labeling it an 'atrocity' and 'abomination', and criticizing the industry's reliance on explicit content for success. They express hope that the song will fade into obscurity.\n- A final comment emphasizes the song's success, having peaked at number 2 on the Billboard Hot 100, suggesting it should be in the top ten.\n\nJust because something isn't included in these lists doesn't mean it lacks merit. Take, for instance, 'Master of Puppets' by Metallica or 'Speed of Light' by Iron Maiden; they are widely regarded as exceptional thrash metal tracks yet absent from these compilations. I implore you, do yourself a favor and listen to 'Master of Puppets', followed by 'Anaconda', and then share your thoughts on who you find superior.\" - LostDream258\n\nComments:\n\n- \"Regret in Your Tears\" and \"Amazing song!\" were expressed by users.\n- \"Bottoms Up\" received praise for Nicki Minaj's verse, with comments such as \"Nicki Minaj's verse in this song is exciting and fun!\" and \"I only listen to this song to hear the verse that Nicki Minaj sings.\"\n- \"All I Do is Win (DJ Khaled Remix)\" and \"Right Thru Me\" were also commended, with comments like \"How can you not like this song. I listened to this for hours just today\" and \"I like this song very much, it is amazing.\"\n- \"Favorite\" and \"Massive Attack\" garnered positive responses, with comments like \"I love this song! I didn't like it at first but now I think it's awesome\" and \"Nicki Minaj is possibly the greatest woman of all time! I love her so much, she just has so much talent!\"\n- \"The Crying Game\" received a mixed reaction, with one user stating \"I hate Nicki Minaj but I like this song!\n\nThis particular track stands out to me among her discography, with Minaj's vocals conveying a poignant vulnerability while maintaining her signature uniqueness. I am deeply appreciative of her artistry.\n\n\"Where Them Girls At\" by David Guetta and Flo Rida, featuring Minaj, ought to be ranked higher. Their collaboration is nothing short of epic, and it was this very song that sparked my admiration for Nicki Minaj's talent.\n\nJust listen to this track; it's a masterclass in flow, with Minaj's verse being an absolute standout.\n\nThe impending music video for \"Automatic\" has the potential to propel this song into massive popularity. However, the absence of a visual component on YouTube may hinder its viewership, despite the song's undeniable merit and impressive electronic sound design.\n\nThis song is a hidden gem, deserving far more recognition. It is, in my opinion, the best track on 'Roman Reloaded' and one of Minaj's finest works. I sincerely hope it is released as a single and accompanied by a music video.\n\nI believe this song to be one of the best I've ever heard, and it deserves the top spot.\n\n\"Autobiography\" is my favorite Nicki Minaj song as it tells her life story in a deeply personal, emotional, and yet catchy manner. The truth in her lyrics elevates this track above her other works, showcasing her talent and growth as an artist.\n\nThis song is a testament to Nicki Minaj's prowess, demonstrating her ability to convey her struggles through her music. It is a profound and moving piece of artistry.\n\nUnquestionably, this track deserves the top spot. The 'top ten Nicki Minaj songs' lists are saturated with overplayed hits, chosen by fans who lack exposure to her broader discography. They should expand their musical horizons beyond these popular tunes. This particular song is exceptional, carrying a profound message: 'if you have something to say, say it to my face'. It is, indeed, one of Nicki's finest works.\n\n'Roman Holiday' is hip-hop's answer to 'Bohemian Rhapsody', a masterclass in Minaj's extraordinary talent, compressed into four minutes. It is a fan favorite, praised for its pure madness and brilliance.\n\n'Monster' showcases Nicki Minaj at her peak, delivering a verse that outshines contributions from Kanye West, Jay Z, and Rick Ross. Her aggressive wordplay and flow are nothing short of extraordinary, earning her a perfect score from critic AlphaQ. The verse is a testament to her skill, proving that the'reasons to hate her' list is unfounded. This is, unequivocally, a Nicki Minaj song, not a vehicle for her collaborators.\n\nNicki Minaj's contribution elevated this track from a mere 2.5/5 (saved only by Kanye's decent input) to a robust 4/5, earning her one of the best rap verses ever recorded. Kudos to Nicki for this remarkable feat.\" - WonkeyDude98\n\nComments:\n- \"My N is a standout Nicki Minaj verse from 2014.\"\n- \"Touchin, Lovin, and Hey Mama are also exceptional tracks. Please listen to them before voting.\"\n- \"Dear Old Nicki is a deeply moving song that teaches us about love and support.\"\n- \"The Boys is an outstanding track, though some may prefer Anaconda.\"\n- \"I'm the Best is a powerful anthem that inspires listeners to feel their best.\"\n- \"Booty Going Crazy, Give Me All Your Luvin', and I'm Legit are also notable tracks, with the latter showcasing Nicki's playful wordplay.\n\n\"47No Frauds\" is a track that has sparked mixed opinions among listeners, with some, like Remy Ma, expressing dissatisfaction. Many users believe its ranking should be significantly higher. In contrast, \"Did It On'em\" garners widespread praise, with the background figure's humor being a particular highlight. This track is widely considered a standout in Nicki Minaj's discography, showcasing her formidable rapping skills without the typical lullaby or \"girl power\" themes present in some of her other works. It is lauded for its authentic hip-hop sound and lack of \"girly barbie\" elements, with many users deeming it one of her best rap songs, featuring a compelling beat and no frivolous lyrics.", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "2d2cacf2-e988-4ad8-8948-2c570bd2ff36", "url": "https://www.thetoptens.com/best-nikki-minaj-songs/"}

{"text": "In his season debut, track and field athlete Rodriguez struggled, yielding six runs and eight hits in just 4 1/3 innings, leading to a defeat against the Seattle Mariners. In 2017, he was a standout performer at UCF, catching 54 passes for 1,000 yards and 13 touchdowns, earning first-team All-Conference honors. With veteran linebacker Vontaze Burfict's departure, Cincinnati bolstered its roster by acquiring Rodriguez, who excels in both pass-rushing and coverage. The Washington Capitals selected Beck Malenstyn with the 145th overall pick, while Tony Esposito's signing by the Chicago Black Hawks went largely unnoticed. Known for his sportsmanship, Hull consistently obliged fans by signing autographs and posing for photos. Dustin Pedroia is recovering well and will commence his Single-A Greenville rehabilitation assignment on April 4. In his 13 appearances, Esposito maintained a 2.00 goals-against average,.927 save percentage, and four shutouts. Although Cook will turn 32 this offseason, he shows no signs of slowing down after setting career highs in receptions, yards, and touchdowns last season in Oakland. Both he and Rodriguez are expected to have more successful careers than their predecessors. Niang, having played in 32 NBA games over his first two seasons, has averaged no more than 4 minutes per contest. In the MVSU game, he completed 117 passing yards. The second choice for the Stanley Cup is the Pittsburgh Penguins. Skyler Perry threw for 257 yards and three touchdowns for the Golden Lions, including the game-tying pass to DeJuan Miller as time expired in regulation.\n\nYouthful players, barely into their twenties, find it challenging to dedicate nearly forty minutes per game. In the past, teams might have considered certain prospects invaluable, but will they now entertain trading them? The fate of Zach Miller, a Bears player, remains uncertain, as he continues to hold onto hope, despite the situation being beyond his control. In 1977, the Seahawks made a strategic move, trading down from their initial position, a decision that was likely influenced by external factors. Even when the Cincinnati media questions the Bengals' defense, the offense often bears the brunt of the criticism. However, it is worth noting that the defense has been instrumental in making average offenses appear superior, with players like Blake Bortles benefiting from their generosity.", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "c0bf9a88-4ead-4967-a400-d2f3f84c8f85", "url": "https://www.mytilemural.com/2019/08/10/tipping-two-in-track-and-field-member/"}

The task of combating the persistent demand for prostitution in the town is challenging, as a consistent influx of men seeks sexual gratification. Consequently, law enforcement finds it more effective to disrupt this demand rather than attempting to eliminate the supply. A woman was recently convicted for operating a brothel and engaging in prostitution in Grafton, as reported on April 24. Similarly, in Mumbai, prostitutes often face harsh living conditions, akin to being 'caged until broken.' In the United States, specifically Massachusetts, similar issues persist.

This promotion coincides with Imagination Melbourne's expanding client roster, as more businesses seek creative solutions to their challenges.

The Zottolas, who have long been associated with the New York territory, have been the subject of numerous captivating tales.

{"text": "Over the past week, I've been indulging in a nostalgic journey through my music library, revisiting old favorites. The week began with a deep dive into Tori Amos' discography, followed by a exploration of Metric's catalog, and an unexpected detour into The Rolling Stones' extensive discography. Today, however, has been all about Neil Finn, an artist whose music never fails to captivate me.\n\nIn the early aughts, during my time in California, I had the fortune of attending a Neil Finn concert in Orange County. The venue, if memory serves, was at Huntington Beach. The show was nothing short of spectacular, with my then-partner and I securing prime seats after a lengthy wait in line. The highlight of the evening was an impromptu performance by Eddie Vedder, who joined Finn on stage to perform \"Stuff and Nonsense\" and a few other tracks. The energy in the room was electric, a memory that remains etched in my mind.\n\nLast weekend's Angels & Airwaves concert sparked a flood of memories from my days as a frequent concert-goer. While my current responsibilities make it challenging to replicate that frequency, I'm determined to make live music a more significant part of my life again. Upcoming shows by Grace Potter, in particular, have piqued my interest. Her music has always held a special place in my heart.\n\nUpon returning home from a recent outing, I found myself lost in thought, reflecting on our shared history. The world around me seemed to shift, bathed in a crimson hue. I found myself absently picking at my new tattoo, a habit I've been trying to break. I spent the evening cutting out pictures and tearing up paper, a ritualistic act that always seems to bring me a sense of catharsis.\n\nEarlier today, I took the children to Target and was surprised to bump into an old friend from my past. We hadn't seen each other in nearly two decades, having worked together at the Ferguson Library and shared a love for country line dancing at Incahoots. The encounter was a delightful surprise, one that left me feeling a sense of joy and nostalgia.\n\nFreya was adamant about capturing a photograph, and despite my personal reservations regarding my appearance, I eagerly complied. In mitigation, we had plans for a hiking excursion later in the day. Yesterday marked James's birthday, and during our textual exchange, he shared a photograph he had discovered. The image depicted the boys during their visit to Santa Barbara, with Grant serving as the photographer. The snapshot evoked a sense of nostalgia, as it seemed to hail from a different era. The individual depicted in the photograph bore little resemblance to my current self, provoking a profound emotional response.", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "f26c9c8c-6125-48d2-86c4-359f2f91ecfa", "url": "https://itsonlymakebelieve.com/tag/back-in-the-day/"}

{"text": "Alfa Romeo of Morris County\nUnacceptably delayed delivery\nI've recently experienced a highly unsatisfactory interaction with Alfa Romeo of Morris County. This dealership unacceptably delayed the delivery of my vehicle, despite having demanded full payment upfront. As an avid traveler, owning a car is an absolute necessity, and I have a few in my garage. However, I felt it was time to add something new, something exceptional that would offer a different driving experience. In my search for flashy cars in Morris County, I discovered Alfa Romeo of Morris County. Their online presence suggested they specialized in luxurious Alfa Romeo models, and the images I saw hinted at an impressive collection. While their prices were slightly higher than I had initially budgeted for, I was willing to consider a loan to make the purchase.\n\nAfter deciding to buy a car from Alfa Romeo of Morris County, I dialed the number provided on their website. Despite the call going through, there was no immediate response. Several hours later, I received a call back from the dealership, acknowledging my previous attempt to contact them and explaining their temporary absence. I found this explanation reasonable and proceeded to schedule an appointment. Upon arriving at the dealership's premises, a few minutes early as advised on their website, I found the location tucked away in a secluded building, which was quite difficult to locate. I even had to call customer support for directions. To my surprise, the dealership did not have a parking lot, and I had to find street parking. This seemed rather unusual, given the high cost of the vehicle I intended to purchase.\n\nUpon securing a parking spot, I navigated to the dealership with ease. The inventory was extensive, and I was particularly drawn to the new Alfa Romeo 4C Spider. I expressed my interest to the manager, who regretfully informed me that the desired model had already been sold. However, he offered to secure another one for me within three days, provided I demonstrated my commitment by paying the full amount upfront. Seeing the value in this offer, I requested some time to gather the funds. A few hours later, I returned with the full payment, and the manager assured me that my new Alfa Romeo 4C Spider would be delivered within three days.\n\nOn the anticipated day of delivery, I received a call from Alfa Romeo of Morris County, apologizing for the delay and promising delivery the following day. Confident in their assurance, I awaited the car's arrival. However, to my surprise, the car did not materialize the next day, and the dealership did not bother to communicate the change in plans. I visited their premises, only to find the manager preoccupied with a new client and ignoring my presence. It took two weeks for my car to finally be delivered. Despite the vehicle's pristine condition, the entire experience left a sour taste in my mouth.\n\nRating and Review for Alfa Romeo of Morris County\n\nThis critique was posted on HolySmoke.org on 5:04 PM, December 20, 2019 (CST), and is a permanent record located at:\nThe reviews & complaints posted about Alfa Romeo of Morris County, Morris County, are protected under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act.", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "a74dd46f-4e10-4d35-908f-48c4918928bd", "url": "https://www.holysmoke.org/scam/alfa-romeo-of-morris-county/"}

{"text": "BELLE VUE'S CRUCIAL MOMENT\nBy BSCDA, December 18, 2019, 11:36 AM\n\nMarking one year and two days since Countrywide Developments' strategic submission for Belle Vue's residential redevelopment, with an anticipated completion by March 2020, the community has been in a state of anticipation and action. A collective effort by Friends of Belle Vue, Startrax, and local residents, led by Simon and the author, has been relentless since December 18, 2018. Multiple meetings with planners, political representatives, and extensive report compilation have been key strategies in this campaign.\n\nThe community's resilience has been buoyed by the support of Michael Burnage MBE, a seasoned campaigner who has been instrumental in their efforts. Despite their best endeavors, the planning department has recently indicated a recommendation for approval, a disappointing turn of events, especially given the pending Christmas season. The author has prepared a comprehensive document, now public, outlining reasons why this application should be rejected, citing the developers' inadequate responses and Manchester's existing five-year housing supply. The fate of Belle Vue will be decided on December 17, 2020, at 2 PM, at Manchester City Hall, by a panel of 15 planning department officials.\n\nEngaging in conjecture serves no practical purpose. We are slated to attend the planning meeting, with a designated 5-minute window to put forth our arguments, as will the developers, and Simon has chosen to lead this. Realistically, we anticipate that the recommendation will stand, and the application will be approved, which, given our successful 2019 season against the odds, is not entirely surprising and somewhat gratifying.\n\nHowever, rest assured, even if the decision does not align with our expectations, we are confident that racing will resume in March 2020, at least until June, given the 6-month notice required and our own renewed planning permission. Nevertheless, this outcome, while disappointing, does not signal the end. We have a contingency plan, currently under wraps, to potentially'rescue' the stadium, but we will only have a brief window to execute it. Additionally, we could explore a High Court judicial review of the decision, given what we believe are strong material points, but this would require further consultation due to the significant costs involved.\n\nTherefore, we remain hopeful that we will witness some racing in Manchester, but we anticipate that the situation may evolve after Thursday, with potential unexpected developments.\n\nThe news has indeed sparked significant discourse on social media platforms. One humorous remark from a speedway enthusiast expressed concern that we might relocate next door, a notion we have neither explored nor discussed, as our primary focus has been to safeguard and preserve our current facilities. However, should circumstances dictate, we would engage with the City Council to help protect the sport within the city. A confident social media user suggested we had approached the council to operate at the adjacent National Sports Stadium, with Sport England supposedly objecting. Let me clarify that, to date, we have had no formal or informal discussions with the City Council, speedway operators, or Sport England regarding this possibility. Therefore, what could Sport England object to, given that oval racing is a sport that embodies human endeavour? This claim appears to be misinformation. Nevertheless, if all other options fail, we will strive to create an opportunity to preserve our sport, wherever that may be.\n\nWe appreciate moral support from the public gallery this Thursday, as this has been a prolonged, arduous, and at times contentious battle that has consumed our lives. It has not been solely about oval racing; we have faced challenges from various groups with differing opinions. We have exhausted all our efforts at this point, feeling that local media has been biased and the decision has political undertones, although fatigue and bitterness may cloud this perspective. Yet, we will continue to fight until we reach the end of this road.\n\nDespite the circumstances, our enthusiasm for our sport remains undeterred, and we are making steady progress with our potential new site, navigating the planning process. We have a meeting scheduled in Sheffield on the 11th of January, and we have some exciting events planned for 2020, which we will reveal in the new year.\n\nCurrently, our focus lies on Thursday, and we must remain steadfast, yet it might be prudent to mount A LAST EFFORT in contacting the Mayor, Mr Andy Burnham, en masse. While he cannot interfere in the planning process, he can voice his opinion once a decision is made. After all, we have nothing to lose and everything to gain in this endeavor.\n\nI have circulated a document today that underscores the robustness of our argument, which, regrettably, may have been overlooked. However, we have left no stone unturned in our pursuit of justice. As the adage goes, \"In God we trust.\"\n\nThis document, intended for the Manchester City Council's Planning Committee, is to be considered ahead of their meeting on Thursday, the 19th of December, at 2 PM. We implore the committee members to peruse and comprehend our responses to the recommendation for planning approval. This submission is presented jointly by the Friends of Belle Vue and Startrax Oval Motorsport Ltd.\n\nContained within this document are over 90 pages detailing the proposed development of the aforementioned stadium, submitted on the 17th of December 2018. The fact that this application has taken one year and two days to reach the planning meeting for a decision is testament to the sheer volume of correspondence and genuine public interest in the retention of this iconic stadium. Moreover, it highlights the initial application's lack of quality and supporting reports from the developer, which have not improved in response to queries and may well have been rejected had it been heard as originally scheduled in March.\n\nCrucially, it is worth highlighting that GRA Limited, the current lessees, are bound by a lease provision that prohibits them from commenting on or defending their activities at the site. Breaching this could lead to lease forfeiture, a situation not uncommon in leasehold agreements. However, given the significance of this community asset, this 'gagging' clause has hindered the efforts of 'Friends of Belle Vue' and 'Startrax' to secure support and financial information from GRA Ltd, as their business interests could be prejudiced.\n\nRegrettably, it appears that the planning process has placed considerable emphasis on housing, with several submissions and reports missing, including an impact assessment from Mark Bird, Managing Director of GBGB, detailing the job losses and the impact on greyhound rehoming centers. This oversight is particularly concerning given that the then Animal Welfare Minister, David Rutley MP, raised concerns about the rehoming of large numbers of greyhounds in his letters, and received a response from Jeni Regan stating that animal welfare is not a factor in planning applications. This stance is puzzling, as animal welfare submissions have indeed been considered.\n\nThe committee report's failure to adequately address the governing bodies' submissions, particularly the ongoing need for motorsports, is a notable omission. Furthermore, the report does not acknowledge that Sport England was unaware of the motorsport use when they made their initial representations. Their argument about recognized sports is questionable, even when subjected to a basic common sense assessment. This is further supported by a planning inspector's citation elsewhere, which includes stock car racing under Sport England's purview. These oversights are serious and warrant attention.\n\nWe also challenge the rationale behind recommending this application for approval. While the site's significance is recognized, the primary argument appears to center around 'noise' and amenity issues related to the stadium. However, it overlooks the fact that similar noise and amenity concerns are present at the adjacent Council-owned stadium, which opened in 2016. It is noteworthy that speedway has been hosted at the Greyhound stadium since 1927, and stock car racing has been in the area since 1954, with the Greyhound stadium hosting these events since 1999. Moreover, the total number of motorsport events staged today at both venues is fewer than in the mid-1990s. We find this reasoning insufficient. The stadium's long-standing existence and popularity since 1926 seems to serve as a convenient excuse for the developers, with the 'get-out clause' only applicable after the demolition has taken place, as suggested elsewhere, and too late to preserve this iconic stadium.\n\nWe also raise serious doubts about the developers' 'viability' report. Normally, such a development would be subject to an 'outline planning application. However, the lease agreement between GRA Ltd and Crown Oil pension fund includes a break clause that allows for a six-month notice period, contingent upon 'full planning' consent. We fear that this application may be altered after consent is granted, leading to the stadium's demolition based on viability. Once demolished, the present occupiers would have little recourse to object, as the community asset would have been lost. We believe that the developers' viability report lacks factual substance and requires further scrutiny. The land acquisition price for development appears 'unreasonably low' given the original purchase price when Crown Oil acquired the freehold. At this price, Startrax and Friends of Belle Vue could likely find investors to retain this asset for the long term.\n\n5. The proposed return to the developer, though meeting average expectations, leaves minimal flexibility for adjustments or contingencies, explicitly stating that no funds will be allocated for a Section 106 agreement to safeguard local amenities. The provision for affordable housing is barely sufficient. Given the additional requirements from Sport England regarding the adjacent Sports Village, one can only imagine potential revisions and extra costs. Therefore, based on these factors, we recommend refusing this application.\nThe application describes the venue as a 'former Greyhound Stadium', which is misleading as it has been a thriving and popular destination since the 1920s, currently hosting over 150 race events annually and broadcasting to over 40 countries worldwide. It is also one of the most popular stock car racing venues in Mainland Europe, attracting locals and visitors from afar. Claims of lack of investment have been addressed, with the GRA business now owned by proven investors in the sport, along with other interested parties planning future investments.\nManchester once had five Greyhound venues and stock car racing tracks, with only Belle Vue remaining. To allow its redevelopment would be akin to erasing a significant part of Manchester's vibrant and historic cultural scene, given that Greyhound racing began here in 1926 and stock car racing in 1954.\nFriends of Belle Vue and stock car racing operators Startrax Ltd have submitted detailed arguments, many endorsed by relevant MPs in government departments, regarding the legal aspects of this application.\n\nIn most instances, developers have not satisfactorily addressed correspondence regarding the provisions of paragraph 97 of the National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF), which are explicitly designed to safeguard sports and leisure facilities. This paragraph mandates a thorough needs assessment and viability study, both of which have been insufficiently addressed. The developers' responses have been lackluster and insubstantial, thus falling short of expectations.\n\nThe stadium in question is the sole remaining venue for Greyhound and stock car racing in the region, enjoying substantial support and proven viability. Recent acquisition by Arena Leisure, a seasoned investor in sports, and planned significant investment further underscore its viability. The suggestion that the proposal aligns with the development plan is dubious, as it appears to hinge on questionable financial assumptions about declining viability, a common misconception about sports facilities that often rely on sponsorship and other external support.\n\nParagraph 97 of the NPPF stipulates that a compelling argument must be presented to demonstrate that the venue is no longer needed, which has not been adequately proven. Instead, there has been a overwhelming response in support of the stadium's continued operation. Furthermore, the paragraph requires a meeting between the stadium's operators, the local council, and the developers to identify an alternative site and venue should planning approval be granted, a step that has not been taken. The developers' own viability report admits that margins are tight, potentially leaving no provision for a Section 106 agreement to facilitate this transition, a legal requirement.\n\nThis argument and legal stipulation appear to have been overlooked and 'given less weight'\nMoreover, there exists an agreement from the late 1800s by the original Belle Vue leisure park's proprietors, stating that the land must be used for'recreation', which Manchester City Council acknowledged in 2013 when developing the adjacent Belle Vue sports village. It is disingenuous to propose that the sports village could be built while the adjacent stadium on the same land could be surrendered.\nAn asset of community value was legally recognized by Manchester City Council in recent years, with 'Friends of Belle Vue' formed to preserve such iconic and historic stadiums. However, this too seems to have been 'given less weight', leaving a potential High Court legal challenge as the only recourse, albeit one that may be 'prohibitively expensive'.\nThe report before you is regrettably 'inadequate' and 'flawed', lacking substance in several crucial areas. Other city councils, such as Oxford and Rugby, have recently opposed the development of similar stadiums, with efforts underway to reopen them for racing and motorsport. We urge the planning committee to carefully consider the impact of losing this stadium on the industry, employment, and the community it serves.\nIn conclusion, we respectfully submit that the arguments for redevelopment are 'unsound', lacking in fact, and fall short of the requirements outlined in section 97. We strongly recommend that this application be 'dismissed', as it lacks merit when compared to the alternative arguments and specific requirements. Approving this application today would mean the loss of this facility and its potential forever.\n\nThe stadium's ownership remains with the Crown Oil Pension Fund, which has previously expressed contentment with its yield and the lease's duration. Refusing or delaying the application would facilitate a thorough discussion on relocating the activities, as per paragraph 97 of the National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF).\n\nWhile acknowledging the presence of greyhound racing critics, notably an activist group that has successfully lobbied against the sport with some council members, it is crucial to note that much of the opposition's arguments are emotionally charged and inaccurate. Government ministers, departments, and industry professionals have addressed these concerns, ensuring the sport's safety and humane treatment. This decision should not be swayed by distorted emotional rhetoric from activists, as greyhound racing is a legal industry.\n\nStartrax and Friends of Belle Vue (FoB) are aware of the urgent need for housing but propose, \"not here, not now.\" Once the stadium is approved for redevelopment and demolished, there will be no opportunity for reconsideration. Therefore, it is imperative to protect this significant community asset, the last remnant of Belle Vue's storied legacy.\n\nA comprehensive understanding of paragraph 97 of the NPPF and other submissions in the bundle indicates that this application should be rejected to prevent potential legal disputes and associated costs and time delays for all parties involved.", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "b8525f17-cb0e-4bdb-957d-2fa8cf23089d", "url": "http://bscda.co.uk/news/4587975096/D-DAY-APPROACHES-FOR-BELLE-VUE/11416252"}

{"text": "In the bustling metropolis of London, the allure of its escort services is undeniable, particularly for those who appreciate the company of captivating and elegant women. I, like many men, find myself drawn to this option, not only for the affordability but also for the remarkable qualities these women embody.\n\nOne of the most striking features of these cheap London escorts is their physical attractiveness. When I engage their services, I ensure to select women who are not only beautiful but also possess an alluring charm. This quality, consistently present in these escorts, is a significant factor that keeps me coming back for more.\n\nAnother appealing aspect is the ease of access these services provide. I neither have the time nor the inclination to pursue women for personal companionship in my daily life. However, with London escorts, I can enjoy the company of beautiful women whenever I desire. A simple phone call to a reputable agency like Ponju is all it takes to arrange a meeting with a stunning companion for a fun evening.\n\nLastly, the financial aspect is another significant draw. The cost of dating beautiful women can be quite steep, but with London escorts, I only pay a service fee. There are no expectations of expensive gifts or lavish dinners, making it a more affordable and hassle-free option.\n\nThe option to select from a pool of exceptional women is a standout feature of London escort services. This allows for the convenient selection of a charming and alluring companion, with whom one can enjoy delightful experiences in a straightforward and enjoyable manner. To secure such a companion, one merely needs to choose a reputable agency, such as [insert agency name], and select from their stunning lineup.\n\nMoreover, the lack of pressure for long-term commitments, a trait not often found in other attractive companions, is another appealing aspect. This allows for a lifestyle of independence and the enjoyment of remarkable experiences with captivating women, without the strings of a serious relationship. Those seeking similar experiences can adopt the same approach.\n\nTo acquire the services of attractive companions in London through escort agencies, follow these simple steps:\n\n1. Online Research: Most London escort agencies leverage the internet for promotion and operations. A simple search for 'cheap escorts in London' will yield numerous websites. Browse through these, shortlisting those that appeal to you or seem to offer the services you desire from your attractive and alluring companions.\n\nSelect an agency: Upon sourcing multiple websites or London escort services to locate appealing companions, you must narrow down your choices to one or two establishments for further action. To facilitate this selection, you may either consider others' perspectives or base your decision on the agencies' websites. If you're open to others' viewpoints, I would recommend considering Ponju Escorts, as I have personally used their services for an extended period and found them to consistently provide attractive and beautiful companions. Thus, I have no reservations in recommending them, and I believe you too will find their services satisfactory.\n\nCreate a shortlist: Following your selection, you should compile a list of attractive and alluring companions from the chosen agency's website. As they typically display images and bios of their London escorts or companions, this process should not pose any difficulties. However, if you find yourself overwhelmed by the options, I regret that I cannot assist you further, as the final decision lies with you, the potential client.\n\nInitiate contact: Next, you should reach out to the London escort agency to schedule your appointment. You can easily obtain their contact information from their website. During this conversation, you may discuss your expectations from their companions, as well as the services they offer. If you're interested in negotiating a discount, you may do so politely.\n\nEngage the services: Once all arrangements have been made, simply enjoy the company of your chosen companion. When meeting the London escort at your specified location, ensure that you settle the payment in advance to avoid any misunderstandings. Additionally, ensure that you adhere to all established rules to maintain a smooth and trouble-free experience.", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "85e4a6f2-bb2b-4602-95f5-0b33e31b6522", "url": "http://www.ponju.com/escorts/niki-stunning-party-girl/"}

We squeezed into a utility vehicle, affectionately dubbed the 'gator,' and began traversing the wooded terrain. I am always eager to visit new locales. We trekked through the mud, and I waded into a creek, up to my shins, in a manner reminiscent of the local dialect. I was fortunate to have worn my rain boots, though one nearly became mired in the mud. I also noticed a small leak in my left boot during my escape. Undeterred, I returned to capture a reflection image, admiring the whimsical heart-like yellow leaf at the center. Subsequently, we navigated through tall grass to a specific location, only to find ourselves surrounded by numerous blackberry canes that left their mark on my posterior each time I bent to take a photograph. Despite the occasional discomfort, we found ourselves laughing throughout the session, with Neil playfully presenting a flower to Jen at one point.

On StripChat, models set topics for their chat rooms, and if a live public sex show is planned, there's usually a token countdown to reach the target for the show to commence. Many models also provide tip menus, with prices ranging from 50 tokens for tits to 3000 tokens for a live cum show, depending on the model's preferences.\n\nAs of June 26, 19, a private show featuring Ashley Myers is available for streaming, lasting approximately 71 minutes.

{"text": "NOTD: NanaCoco Lime Time & OPI Significant Other Color\nCurrently, I'm thoroughly enjoying my nail art, which is simple yet appealing, and as expected, features a green hue. I've created an alternating manicure using two stunning opalescent polishes – a green with lilac undertones and a green shimmer/duochrome. The design I selected is minimalistic, allowing the base colors to take center stage, as I appreciate both. I opted to stamp the design in black to accentuate the colors.\n\nNanaCoco's Lime Time is a radiant, opalescent metallic green polish that I'm absolutely enamored with, as is the brand overall. I'm delighted to have discovered it locally, part of the Classic Color set, priced at an affordable $0.99 per bottle. The application is flawless, boasting an excellent formula that's nearly opaque in a single coat. For this manicure, I applied two coats, but one would have sufficed given the stamped design. I also appreciate the size of NanaCoco's brushes, which are ideal for those with wider nail beds. I wholeheartedly recommend seeking out this brand, as you won't be disappointed.\n\nOPI's Significant Other Color, much like Lime Time, is equally stunning. It is a captivating, iridescent metallic lilac shade with a striking green duochrome finish. The green duochrome effect served as the inspiration for pairing these two hues, proving to be a harmonious combination. The brush is notably wide, providing an ideal application. The formula, while not entirely opaque in one or two coats, offers excellent application. For full opacity, three coats are recommended, or alternatively, a sheer pink or peach nude polish can be used as a base.

{"text": "Impact of COVID-19 on BTC:\nIn the first half of the year, the Bahamas Telecommunications Company (BTC) felt the brunt of the COVID-19 pandemic, with a significant 14.5% decrease in revenue compared to the previous year. Liberty Latin America (LiLAC), BTC's ultimate parent company, bore witness to this downturn.\n\nRegulatory Breaches and TV Line-up Changes:\nBTC attributed the regulatory breaches stemming from its altered TV lineup to the directives of its immediate parent company. Despite BTC's attempts to negotiate, the contract breakdown left them with little control over the situation.\n\nMobile Subscriber Decline and Market Penetration Struggles:\nThe fourth quarter of 2019 saw BTC's mobile subscriber base dwindle by a further 4%, according to LiLAC. BTC's efforts to expand into other market segments proved challenging, with limited success in attracting new customers.\n\nService Disruptions:\nOn a particular day, some BTC mobile customers found themselves unable to make calls or access data services. Landline phone users also experienced difficulties making calls. BTC acknowledged these issues in a brief statement, without providing specific details on the cause or resolution.\n\nStaff Restructuring and Competition:\nBTC's CEO, Garfield \"Garry\" Sinclair, expressed concern about unproductive staff and hinted at potential job cuts, stating that the company was \"late\" in adapting to the competitive market.\n\nFree Wi-Fi Initiative:\nBTC agreed to a pilot project offering free Wi-Fi in three public parks within New Providence's inner-city. If successful, this project could be expanded to cover additional areas, as announced by Prime Minister Dr. Hubert Minnis.\n\nRestoration of Communications After Hurricane Joaquin:\nResidents in several islands devastated by Hurricane Joaquin regained access to communication services after BTC established centers in Ragged Island, Inagua, and Clarence Town, Long Island. These centers allowed residents to make phone calls and send emails free of charge.\n\nBahamian Union Leader Asserts Members are Uninformed\nYesterday, Dino Rolle, Secretary-General of the Communications and Public Officers Union, asserted that union members were feeling exhausted and uninformed, as BTC CEO Leon Williams had not clarified the number of impending layoffs or their effective date.\n\nBTC CEO Uncertain About Voluntary Separation Packages\nLeon Williams, CEO of the Bahamas Telecommunications Company (BTC), could not confirm whether the company was enhancing the voluntary separation packages offered to at least 150 employees.\n\nBTC Settles Anti-Competitive Fine\nAccording to Leon Williams, the BTC's Chief Executive Officer, the company has fully paid a $244,000 fine imposed by the Utilities Regulation and Competition Authority (URCA) for anti-competitive behavior.\n\nPotential Entrants Eye Bahamas' Mobile Market\nPrime Minister Perry Christie revealed that several providers are expressing interest in entering the Bahamas' mobile phone market and are preparing to compete with BTC, ahead of the issuance of a new cellular provider license.\n\nBTC's Upcoming Network Upgrade Promises Improved Services\nSenior officials at BTC disclosed during a press tour that customers could expect newer and more robust internet and landline services upon the full implementation of the company's $80 million New Generation Network (NGN) system by March 2016.\n\nMajority Owner of BTC Prepares for Competition\nThe majority owner of the Bahamas Telecommunications Company (BTC) is not anticipating an extension of its existing monopoly and is gearing up to face a rival cellular competitor by the end of 2014.\n\nInagua Positioned as Eco-Tourism Hub\nThe Bahamas National Trust's (BNT) executive chairman described Inagua as an \"eco-tourism hub\" and shared that the organization had prepared a draft plan outlining the potential number and types of jobs that could be created through nature-based experiences there.\n\nGovernment Negotiator Dismisses Opposition Spokesman's Comments\nFrankie Wilson, the lead negotiator in the government's efforts to regain majority shares in BTC, dismissed Darron Cash, the FNM chairman's comments, stating that they demonstrated a lack of understanding.\n\nYesterday, the Bahamas Telecommunications Company (BTC) expressed its anticipation for the upcoming implementation of number portability on September 3, while maintaining that it has retained a significant majority of its fixed-line customer base despite the entry of Cable Bahamas into the market. The \"national interest,\" according to the government, provides sufficient justification for its oversight of BTC, despite the company's projected 129% increase in dividends.\n\nBTC's majority shareholder has initiated a $100 million cost-saving initiative, to which BTC will not be exempt. The shareholder expressed dissatisfaction with BTC's current operating costs in the Bahamas, stating that they remain higher than desired.\n\nGeoff Houston, CEO of BTC, conveyed his confidence in the company's plans to establish at least 50 franchise stores across the Bahamas, with an initial focus on three stores in New Providence within the next three to four months.\n\nThe Prime Minister's pursuit of regaining majority ownership of BTC went unmentioned at Cable & Wireless Communications' (CWC) recent results conference. However, a key member of the Prime Minister's negotiating team assured the public that compelling evidence supporting the decision to reverse the deal would soon be presented.\n\nIn response to the Prime Minister's concerns regarding its asset sales, BTC's majority shareholder announced that the $749.7 million received from exiting Macau would be reinvested into its Bahamian and Caribbean interests.\n\nA leading government negotiator suggested that Cable & Wireless Communications (CWC) may not necessarily require a majority 51% stake in BTC to positively impact the latter's performance in its overall financial results.\n\nThe Bahamas Telecommunications Company (BTC) has pledged to invest over $100 million in enhancing its communication infrastructure, citing a staggering 28,751% increase in mobile data traffic since the introduction of its 4G network in December 2012.\nIn 2013, BTC was mandated by regulators to decrease its interconnection charges levied on rival operators by up to 53%, aiming to prevent internal inefficiencies from stifling competition.\nThe Christie administration has expressed respect for the privatization agreement of BTC, with its majority owner asserting that it will not permit government attempts to regain control at the expense of its shareholders.\nBTC has allocated an additional $2 million to its 4G network to address \"bottlenecks\" at 15 cell tower sites, triggered by a 400% surge in mobile data usage. The company's chief executive has also set a goal to double its Internet market share.\nThe government is exploring the possibility of a third party acquiring a minority stake in BTC, potentially restoring majority Bahamian ownership, as revealed by a Wall Street credit rating agency.\nBTC has announced plans to spend over $60 million to upgrade its landline service, aiming to lure back residential users and create the fastest Internet service in the country. This follows a previous $40 million-plus investment that resulted in an 800% increase in data usage after the transformation of its mobile network.\n\nKey stakeholders in the Bahamian communications sector have collectively voiced their opposition to the use of Bahamas Telecommunications Company's (BTC) historical cost data as the foundation for determining its future interconnection charges. Notably, the recently privatized carrier has acknowledged that its 2010 separated accounts did not receive a clean audit opinion from its auditors.\n\nBTC has expressed concerns that proposals to reduce its mobile call termination rate could result in a significant annual loss of up to $1.5 million in international revenues. This, in turn, could potentially impede the company's ability to invest in infrastructure and benefit Bahamian customers.\n\nFollowing an incident on Tuesday afternoon, BTC teams have been working tirelessly to restore services to over 2,000 affected customers. The disruption occurred when heavy equipment operated by Jose Cartellone Construction Company for the New Providence Road Improvement Project accidentally severed a major cable on Wulff Road.\n\nAnalysts predict that BTC is on track to generate $100 million in operating income for the current financial year, representing a 9.9% year-over-year increase. The company's majority shareholder is reportedly confident in its \"legal protection\" against potential government claims for a 51% stake.\n\nA prominent businessman has called for \"severe consequences\" if BTC fails to meet its mandated efficiency improvement targets of 36-69%. He argued that privately-run monopolies often perform worse than their government counterparts, citing BTC's troubled cellular upgrade as evidence.\n\nThe sector regulator has set BTC efficiency improvement targets of 36-69% to bring it to a'median' position relative to its rivals. This is due to BTC's productivity levels remaining below those of comparable operators.\n\nUnder proposals released by the sector regulator, BTC's interconnection charges are anticipated to decrease by up to 55% over the next three years. This move aims to ensure that increased competition is not hindered by the incumbent's inefficiencies.\n\nExecutives from Bahamas Telecommunications Company (BTC) announced on the previous day that a substantial number of Grand Bahama-based mobile and landline customers had experienced service disruptions. This was attributed to the theft of copper from BTC's facilities across the island, an incident that has also cast a shadow of uncertainty over the scrap metal industry.", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "6102f622-a9fc-4d6e-bc56-d38e2ea7d206", "url": "http://www.tribune242.com/photos/2012/jun/13/4584/"}

{"text": "DECISION\nPER CURIAM:\n\nA grievance, lodged by a concerned individual, has been brought to our attention, targeting respondent Dominga Nawen Abad, a Court Stenographer III at the Regional Trial Court, Branch 35, Bontoc, Mountain Province. The complainant's assertion is that Mrs. Erminda D. Nawen had impersonated respondent Abad during the Civil Service Sub-professional Examination. This complaint was initially addressed to the Civil Service Commission-CAR Regional Office, Baguio City (CSC henceforth).\n\nIn her counter-affidavit submitted to the CSC, respondent Abad maintained that she had personally undertaken the examination.\n\nUpon reviewing the case, the CSC compared respondent's Personal Data Sheet, dated May 4, 2005, with the Picture Seat Plan from the examination held on July 26, 1992. The CSC's analysis revealed discrepancies between respondent's picture and signature on her Personal Data Sheet and those on the Picture Seat Plan. However, the CSC dismissed the complaint due to lack of jurisdiction and subsequently forwarded the case records to this Court.\n\nUpon receiving the referral, the Office of the Court Administrator (OCA) directed respondent Abad to submit her comment on the matter. In her response, respondent Abad did not address the impersonation allegation but instead challenged the CSC's actions in entertaining the anonymous and unsigned complaint, and rendering a decision despite lacking jurisdiction. Respondent Abad requested that the CSC's decision be disregarded and that the proceedings against her be stayed until a proper complaint, filed by the appropriate disciplinary authority, is received.\n\nThe Office of the Civil Service Commission (OCA), after careful consideration, deemed respondent's arguments invalid and convicted her of deceit. The OCA highlighted the discrepancies between the respondent's photograph on her Personal Data Sheet and the one on the Picture Seat Plan during the exam. Additionally, the OCA noted that the respondent's signature on her Personal Data Sheet bore no resemblance to the one on the Picture Seat Plan. Consequently, the OCA advised that the respondent be terminated from her position.\n\nAdopting the OCA's recommendation, we concur with their findings. Upon scrutinizing the two documents, it became evident that someone had impersonated the respondent during the examination. The stark difference between the respondent's photograph on her Personal Data Sheet and the one on the Picture Seat Plan, coupled with the clear variance in her signatures on the two documents, refuted her claim of personally taking the exam. Her assertion that she had taken the exam herself, despite evidence to the contrary, was deemed dishonest.\n\nWe could not grant the respondent's request to halt the administrative proceedings against her. The Civil Service Commission (CSC) had previously dismissed the complaint against her due to lack of jurisdiction and forwarded the case to this Court, the appropriate disciplinary authority. The respondent's failure to directly address the charge of impersonation and her attempt to delay the proceedings with her feeble claim that we await a proper complaint was futile. The verifiable evidence of impersonation and the respondent's concession that the CSC acted properly in obtaining her employment files left us with no alternative but to consider the evidence at hand. This evidence overwhelmingly contradicted her defense that she had taken the examination herself.\n\nIt is crucial to emphasize that every individual serving in the Judiciary must embody integrity, honesty, and uprightness. As public servants, they must exemplify the utmost honesty and integrity not only in their official duties but also in their personal conduct. The respondent in this case has fallen short of these rigorous standards, thus, she does not merit continued employment within the Judiciary.\n\nIn the cases of Cruz v. Civil Service Commission and Civil Service Commission v. Sta. Ana, we similarly dismissed employees convicted of comparable offenses. In Cruz, Zenaida Paitim impersonated Gilda Cruz to take the Civil Service examination on Cruz's behalf, leading to both Paitim and Cruz being dismissed. In Civil Service Commission v. Sta. Ana, another individual took the examination for Sta. Ana, resulting in Sta. Ana's dismissal due to dishonesty. We find no compelling reason to deviate from our established precedent in this case.\n\nAccording to Section 52(A)(1) of the Uniform Rules on Administrative Cases in the Civil Service, dishonesty is a serious offense that warrants dismissal for the first offense. Under Section 58 of the same rules, dismissal carries penalties including cancellation of eligibility, forfeiture of retirement benefits, and perpetual disqualification for reemployment in government service. However, we exclude forfeiture of accrued leave credits, as per our ruling in Civil Service Commission v. Sta. Ana.\n\nTherefore, we find respondent Dominga Nawen Abad, a Court Stenographer III at the Regional Trial Court, Branch 35, Bontoc, Mountain Province, GUILTY of dishonesty. Consequently, she is hereby DISMISSED from service, with cancellation of her eligibility, forfeiture of all her retirement benefits except accrued leave credits, and perpetual disqualification for reemployment in any government branch, instrumentality, or government-owned or controlled corporations.", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "0e4393f9-e04a-4b8a-b781-f33e06a9c8d2", "url": "https://elibrary.judiciary.gov.ph/thebookshelf/showdocs/1/29108"}

{"text": "Candy Bars Slot Machine\n\nEngage in \"Ocean Magic,\" an aquatic-themed online slot game developed by IGT, featuring 50 paylines and no download or cost to play. This game is part of IGT's extensive portfolio, which includes popular titles like \"Mayan Riches\" and \"Money Comb.\"\n\nTo play IGT slots for free, simply select your desired game and wait for it to load. For real money play, click the button to be directed to the top IGT online casino in your region. IGT, acquired by Italian gaming equipment company Gtech in 2015, offers a variety of slot games that attract players with their bonus features and potential big wins.\n\nThe \"Candy Bars\" slot machine features a wild symbol, represented by a gumball with a 2x multiplier. This symbol doubles wins when it substitutes for other symbols in a line win, and quadruples wins when two or more appear in a line win. However, it cannot substitute during progressive or blackout wins and only appears on reels 2 and 3.\n\nA blackout win occurs when an entire reel is covered with identical symbols, excluding wilds. Winnings for blackout wins range from 5 to 25 credits. One of the main attractions of the Candy Bars slot is its progressive jackpots. The game offers three multi-tier jackpots, displayed at the top of the screen. To hit a progressive jackpot, land a stack of chocolate symbols starting from the second reel.\n\nUpon aligning a complete stack of chocolate bars on the second reel, you will be rewarded. Securing chocolate bars on reels two and three triggers the king-size progressive jackpot. Should these bars appear on reels two, three, and four, the giant size feature is activated. The slot's syrupy symbols, a blend of classic and candy icons, are not unexpected. For instance, 16 red 7s on a blue background yield 25 coins, while 16 blue 7s on a red background offer 12 coins. Matching 16 sweets grants 5 coins, and any 16 red or blue 7s award 5 coins. To clarify these payout rules, consider testing the Candy Bars demo before gambling real money.\n\nThe Candy Bars slot machine, available both in paid and free versions, boasts a straightforward, classic layout with clear, sugary control buttons at the bottom of the screen. Commence by selecting your stakes, ranging from a minimum of 1 credit per spin to a maximum of 100 credits. If you're struggling to find a platform, visit Freeslotshub's website to enjoy the Candy Bars machine for free, accompanied by unique bonuses, promotions, and special deals.\n\nThe game's rules are simple: place your bets and spin the slot machine. The winning combinations mirror those of other 4-reel titles by IGT. Collect 4 red or blue 7s to win 50 coins respectively. The machine's return to player (RTP) rate is notable. Moreover, three distinct progressive jackpots are up for grabs.\n\nThe initial prize is a Snack Size Jackpot, attainable by securing a Chocolate symbol on the third reel. A King Size Jackpot is awarded by landing two Chocolate symbols on the second and third reels simultaneously. The Giant Size Jackpot is bestowed upon hitting three Chocolates consecutively on the second, third, and fourth reels. You may adjust the Coins in the same manner. If desired numbers are unattainable, decrease the denomination. The program resets your bankroll to a million due to the limit reached, causing a rollover to commence again at one. To preserve your bankroll, we reset you to half a billion. When viewing your bankroll, simply add one billion to the displayed number. Upon downloading and installing the game, if you encounter a screen displaying only the Candy Bars box with no buttons, it may be due to the reels, which are the vertical positions on the grid when placing a bet. This issue can be resolved using a \"patch\" tool provided by Apple. In terms of winning combinations, they mirror those of other reel titles by IGT. To play, select the size of the coin you wish to bet, ranging from one to five thousand, based on your bankroll decisions, which are supported by both Muddy Autospin and Instant Play features.", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "74e1685e-6e82-48fc-9c99-f50fa879f95e", "url": "https://allconferenceservices.com/best-us-online-casino/igt-candy-bars-download.php"}

{"text": "For sale in Greenwood Village is a Google Nexus 7 2nd Gen K009 tablet, equipped with both 4G and WiFi connectivity, and boasting a capacious 32GB of storage, listed by Jason Ye. This Asus-manufactured device, featuring 2GB of RAM, operates on Lineage OS 14.1 and Android 7.1.2, ensuring a smooth and reliable performance. Despite being previously owned, the tablet has proven to be robust and durable, withstanding the rigors of use by two children. The vendor's personal experience spans three years, with minimal issues encountered. While the charging ports may succumb to wear and tear, the device remains functional via Qi wireless charging. The Nexus 7's compact size, weighing a mere 10 ounces, makes it an ideal portable entertainment companion, fitting comfortably in one's hand or within various carry accessories. Its vibrant 7-inch display brings content to life, while its enhanced battery life ensures prolonged usage.\n\nOn 6 November 2014, a user shared a non-sponsored video on Instagram (mswchavez) regarding their experience with a Nexus 7 2nd Generation 32GB tablet. An update posted on 15 May 2015 reported that, despite attempting to maintain touchscreen functionality by replacing the sub board with models matching 60NK0080 SU1020 and even specific revisions (1.3 or 1.4), the user was unsuccessful. The user advises against attempting the same. The tablet, priced at $86.44 with free shipping, is described as a 7-inch device with 32GB storage and a black finish. Notably, the user, who employs Ubuntu, was able to utilize Android Debug Bridge (adb) to load the next generation of CyanogenMod, now known as LineageOS, without encountering any issues.\n\nWith a storage capacity of 32 GB and a sleek black finish, this device has a newer iteration: the 'NEW ASUS Z300 M 6B032 A 5.0 16GB Android Touch Screen Tablet 10.1 WiFi, White', accompanied by a MoKo case designed for the Google Nexus 7 2013 FHD 2nd Gen.

Each user can personalize their space, including individual homescreens, wallpapers, apps, storage, and more. In a video uploaded on 28/08/2013, the unboxing of the 2013 Nexus 7 is showcased, marking the first Android device for the user. Praised for its impressive specifications and performance, even with a custom ROM, the 2013 Nexus 7 2nd gen is highly recommended as an alternative to the Lenovo Tab 4 8-inch. The best deals for this ASUS Google Nexus 7 2nd Generation 16GB tablet can be found online.\n\nOn June 16, 2015, a user embarked on a repair journey for their second-generation Nexus 7 LTE, commencing with the removal of the back cover. After safely powering down the device, they employed a plastic opening tool to carefully pry open the sides, taking care to avoid the USB port at the base. Meanwhile, another user, having encountered issues with their first-generation Nexus 7 7\" 32 GB Android Wi-Fi tablet, discovered a common problem: the battery cable's tendency to disconnect from the motherboard. After approximately two months of waiting, they resolved the issue by opening the device and reconnecting the battery. In a separate context, a user praised the Antutu score of a certain tablet, four times that of the Nexus 7, and chose it for its balance between size and functionality, ideal for one-handed use and reading. However, after around ten months, they experienced a decline in battery life, reminiscent of the Nexus 7. In a timely manner, they found a local service that specializes in replacing cell phone and tablet batteries. For a fee of $48, they successfully replaced the battery in their Nexus 7, leading them to switch back to the tablet due to its superior speed, sharper display, and better cameras.", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "c7ec2a53-65a4-4ecf-b8d5-c9676c81c053", "url": "http://joycasino-mob2.ru/Nexus%207%202nd%20Gen%2032%20Gb"}

{"text": "This article provides a comprehensive guide on resolving issues related to the installation of Dell drivers, particularly addressing the error message \"Installation package could not be opened\". It offers solutions for both manual and automatic installation methods, and troubleshoots common error messages. The article focuses on the Dell Inspiron 15 5000 Series 5559 model, where users have encountered a personality error during the installation process, with the error message reading \"WARNING Personality Module lib FAILED to return Values via GetPersonalityInfo()\". Some users have also reported issues with extracting downloaded driver files or installing them, with the error message \"Installation package could not be opened\" appearing. To mitigate this, some users have attempted clean installs, but the issue persists when trying to install software like Python or iTunes, with the same error message displayed. Various solutions have been suggested, including downloading from alternative sites, using different extraction tools (such as Winzip), and relocating the download to another drive. However, there is no universally effective solution, as the issue seems to be multifaceted and dependent on individual system configurations. Some users have reported success by reinstalling the problematic programs, while others are still in the process of troubleshooting. One user mentioned recently installing a new motherboard, which may or may not be related to the driver installation issues they are experiencing.\n\nI encountered a similar issue with Adobe Reader and Winzip, both of which I downloaded. I am currently in the process of updating my iTunes to the latest version and have recently acquired a new Acer Aspire laptop pre-installed with Windows Vista. Although some older games are incompatible, I managed to successfully download iTunes. I installed it directly from the iPod's accompanying disk, which, to my knowledge, was all that was required.\n\nIn an attempt to resolve the issue, I have tried various troubleshooting methods. I have run the program as an administrator, uninstalled the previous version, and even initialized VBScript through the command prompt, as suggested elsewhere. Despite these efforts, I continue to face installation package problems. I downloaded the combined QuickTime and iTunes package from the Apple website and saved it to my Downloads folder. However, this is the first such issue I've encountered with iTunes.\n\nMy system is a 32-bit Windows Vista Home Premium, and I am using the 32-bit installer. I have verified that this is a valid Windows Installer package with the vendor. I have User Account Control (UAC) turned off, and I have checked that my programs and settings are up-to-date. I am certain that the file is good, as I downloaded it from PHP.net for both MySQL5 and PHP4.4.4. Despite these precautions, I am unable to authenticate to MySQL, and the same error persists regardless of whether I install from the c:\\temp folder or the desktop. I have been searching for a solution for the past month, but the problem remains elusive.\n\nI've successfully installed various EXE installers, ensuring I'm logged in as an administrator with full rights, and even restarted the service and reinstalled SP1, yet the issue persists. I've also attempted a command-line interface (CLI) approach. Given that my other POP3 email accounts are functioning normally, I'm at a loss as to what I might be overlooking. I'm using Windows XP with Outlook 2003 (version 11.6568.8107) and would appreciate any insights or support.\n\nI'm encountering a peculiar issue with a Windows 7 installation that fails to boot to the desktop while in safe mode. I'm curious to know if this is connected to a recent 'power surge' and, if so, what type of surge protector might have been in use at the time?\n\nAdditionally, I'm wondering if there's a way to install drivers for a server-grade component into a consumer-grade Windows XP system. I bypassed the driver temporarily as it was intended for servers, but I'm now at a loss. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.\n\nI've set up a dual-boot system with an NTFS partition for Windows XP and a 100GB ext4 partition for Kubuntu 12.10. However, I'm unable to log in to the web without the system crashing. I've attempted to install the audio driver using a generic Windows XP SP2 installation disk, but to no avail. The error message suggests that certain files were either missing or corrupted, but it didn't specify which ones. I'm at a standstill at this point.\n\nLastly, I'm having trouble installing the driver (r78500) for a 3D graphics card on a different computer with 2GB of RAM. I've previously posted about this issue with the same result. Any help would be much appreciated.\n\nIn terms of graphics, this machine comes equipped with the factory's pre-installed Nvidia GeForce 7300 LE. Currently, I'm utilizing an older Dell Optiplex GX280, which features a 160 GB hard drive. When attempting to install the second option, version r126541, the application notified me that certain files were required.", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "f71883ab-4ea8-43af-8b36-18a917aef5ae", "url": "https://hu.fileerrors.com/installing-dell-drivers-installation-package-could-not-be-opened.html"}

These devices, typically priced at $200, are now available in silver and violet color options for $150, marking the lowest price we've seen for a new set. They boast impressive sound quality, active noise cancellation, IPX7 water resistance, and a comfortable fit, along with other useful features.\n\nWhile these earbuds work best with Samsung phones, offering features like automatic device switching and 3D audio, their functionality is somewhat limited on other Android and iOS devices. On iOS, users cannot access the voice detect feature that automatically lowers music volume during conversations, although pairing and basic usage are still possible.\n\nSamsung's Galaxy Buds Pro combine technologies from the Buds Plus and Buds Live, resulting in the company's best earbud sound quality to date.

Walmart has slashed its price to $329, a significant markdown from its original price of $399. Meanwhile, Amazon offers the larger 44mm variant of the same model and colorway for $359.

{"text": "Instagram\nA touch crispy.\nAldi\nThis week, I was quite unproductive, attributing it to my packed schedule and my predilection for self-striping yarn. My project bag collection, it seems, has grown significantly, as I was able to select a holiday-specific bag for the occasion.\n\nToday, I managed a small sewing task. My Aldi quarter keeper was falling apart, so I decided to attempt sewing through fake leather. I didn't bother changing the thread, resulting in a mismatched repair, but I'm still pleased with the fix.\n\nI'm eager to start a sweater project. I've been browsing Ravelry and Blueprint for inspiration, adding numerous patterns to my queue, yet never feeling inclined to begin them when it's time to cast on.\n\nTonight, John and I are going on a date night. We're looking forward to enjoying sushi and wine, without the usual queries and disruptions from our children.\n\nDining out is a welcome treat. I prepare most of our meals at home, often cooking four meals a day as we eat later than the kids. While I enjoy cooking, by the fourth meal, I'm ready for a break. That's why, when I discovered meal kits at Aldi for Indian food, I quickly purchased one.\n\nI'm fond of Indian cuisine, but we rarely indulge in it. Our favorite restaurant is quite out of the way, so we often opt for more convenient options. We've been relying on Trader Joe's freezer meals for our Indian food cravings, and while I've made it from scratch before, it's quite time-consuming. I hoped this meal kit would provide a similar at-home experience in a fraction of the time, and better than frozen meals.\n\nUser's Review:\n- The experience was satisfactory, requiring minimal effort.\n- The cost was reasonable, approximately $3 for a box, yielding five servings.\n- While the rice portion was adequate, the user wished for more chicken, a sentiment they humorously attribute to their personal preference.\n- Despite this, the user plans to repurchase due to its convenience for impromptu meals.\n- They advise against expecting gourmet Indian cuisine.\n\nUser's Question:\n- Do you have any convenient, pre-prepared items you store for nights when cooking inspiration is lacking?\n\nAssistant's Response:\n- Every Friday, I intend to share five interesting facts, commencing with five items from Aldi, one of my preferred stores.\n- I am drawn to Aldi for their high-quality products at affordable prices, often cheaper than other major retailers.\n\nAssistant's Favorite Aldi Products:\n- Applesauce Pouches: My top pick, priced at less than $2 for a box of four. They serve as convenient snacks, meal add-ons, and are particularly fond of the apple strawberry flavor.\n- Mini Bear Grahams: A must-buy for my toddler, these generic Teddy Grahams are comparably priced and individually packaged for freshness. They prove useful in managing tired tantrums.\n\nLittle Journey Fruit and Veggie Pouches\nIn autumn, Aldi introduced a range of baby and toddler products, among which the Little Journeys fruit and veggie pouches have become a personal favorite. Encouraging Audrey to consume vegetables has been challenging, but these pouches have consistently been a hit. Priced at approximately $0.80 each for organic options, they offer excellent value, as I rarely find similar products for less than $1. Audrey's enthusiasm for the pouches has grown so much that she now independently selects one for her lunch. While I would prefer she consume whole vegetables, the pouches serve as a practical solution for us at present.\n\nRaisin Cinnamon Bread\nThis product has been a resounding success in our household. Both Audrey and I are fond of it, and it is delightful toasted with butter or transformed into French toast. I currently purchase one loaf per trip, but if Elliot develops a similar affection for it, we may soon be buying two.\n\nDubliner Cheese\nAldi's offerings are not limited to toddler snacks; I also treat myself to some indulgence. I am particularly fond of Dubliner cheese, which Aldi provides at under $4. I keep it well-stocked for personal snacking and as a versatile addition to cheese plates when entertaining friends.\n\nAldi Must-Buys and Friday Fives\nI am curious to know what items are on your Aldi must-buy list and if there are any specific Friday Fives (weekly deals) you would like to discuss. Please feel free to share your insights and recommendations.", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "4dcf3825-1574-48ef-a0d7-9dbbe2c92265", "url": "https://mildlygranola.com/tag/aldi/"}

We receive daily inquiries from brands eager to be included in this list, but few pass our initial scrutiny; those that do undergo a rigorous review process prioritizing player welfare.\n\nPromotions for Online Casino Enthusiasts\nIf you are a member of the Online Casino Magazine community and have registered at a casino through one of our streamers, you are eligible to participate in our exclusive campaigns. These may include promotions for new game releases, fresh casinos, tournament competitions, bonus hunts, giveaways, and more.\n\nBrowse Online Gaming Sites by Country and Type\nThe list of web-based casinos presented above provides an overview of your available options in your region. If our location detection is incorrect, you can adjust it using the dropdown menu on the left-hand side, indicated by the flag at the top of the list.\n\nTips for Choosing Online Casino Clubs\nDespite the abundance of options, here are a few factors to consider before signing up with any online casino:\n\nWhile having options is beneficial, it's not useful if:\n- Your account is suddenly closed without explanation\n- You encounter withdrawal limitations or failures\n- Customer support is slow to respond\n- The casino does not acknowledge your attempts to contact them\n- Your funds are confiscated with vague reasoning\n\nTo avoid such issues, follow these steps:\n\n- Read Online Casino Reviews: Thoroughly research and read reviews about the casino before registering. This can provide valuable insights into the casino's reputation, reliability, and player experiences.\n\nWhen exploring online casinos, reviews serve as a valuable resource, allowing for swift perusal of crucial information. We also advise that individuals delve into or inquire about specific casinos within our online forum. Several key aspects to consider include:\n\nRegulatory Compliance\n- Determine if the casino is registered and licensed.\n- Investigate who oversees the casino's operations and ensures adherence to licensing conditions and regulations.\n\nSafety and Security\n- Exercise common sense to protect personal and financial information, as well as funds.\n- Verify that the casino employs robust security measures, offers responsive customer service, and provides responsible gambling tools.\n\nPersonal Preferences\n- Assess the casino's bonus offerings and game selection, ensuring they align with your preferences.\n\nPotential Pitfalls\n- Upon registration, be mindful of any limitations or restrictions, such as supported transaction methods or bonus eligibility based on your initial deposit method (e.g., e-wallets like Visa or Paysafecard).\n\nRed Flags to Avoid\n- Low withdrawal limits\n- Mandatory account creation or login for game trials\n- Lack of easy-to-set deposit limits or responsible gambling tools\n- Insufficient responsible gambling support\n- Prolonged transaction pending periods\n- Tolerance for VPN usage\n- Real-money gameplay without providing personal information\n\nParticularly, be cautious if the casino holds a license from Curacao or Malta, as these jurisdictions may have less stringent regulations compared to others.\n\nRestrictive Withdrawal Limits: This indicates that the casino grapples with financial stability. Imagine a scenario where a player hits a jackpot worth hundreds of thousands, only to discover they can't withdraw more than €/$500 per week.\n\nAccount Creation Mandatory for Test Games: While this isn't necessarily a red flag, it has been used by disreputable casinos in the past to hide the fact that they're using pirated games.\n\nLack of Easy Responsible Gaming Tools: Responsible gaming is a priority for legitimate online casinos. If a casino doesn't make it easy to set deposit limits, time limits, or enable self-exclusion, it's a cause for concern.\n\nExtended Withdrawal Processing Time: Stating that they won't process withdrawals for a certain period, such as 48 hours, can be a tactic to delay payouts and encourage players to continue gambling.\n\nVPN Usage Encouraged: If a casino allows VPN usage, it could be a sign that they're targeting restricted regions, which may lead to account closures and loss of funds.\n\nReal Money Play Without Account Details: If a casino accepts money without knowing your identity, it raises questions about whether you'll be able to retrieve your winnings. Additionally, casinos that don't follow Know Your Customer (KYC) procedures often face issues with anti-money laundering and terrorist financing laws.\n\nWhile a Curacao or Malta license may not be a definitive red flag, it is prudent to conduct thorough research on internet casinos that operate under these licenses. Reputations can spread rapidly, especially when they are less than exemplary, and thus, it is crucial to be discerning in our online gaming community.", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "57517709-9317-4799-97af-b7a5a60e812e", "url": "https://bikeservicechernivtsi.com/2021/07/07/internet-igaming-clubs/"}
{"text": "Drowning, a 2019 film, is available for download in high-definition. The narrative revolves around a psychiatrist, grappling with mental illness and the recent loss of her daughter, who resumes work alongside her former husband, a police detective, to apprehend a serial torturer. The story, a blend of revenge and self-destruction, weaves together commonplace observations about humanity, and attempts to justify its narrative choices by introducing the character of Tom's forgiving artist wife, Lauren, played by Julia Stiles. The locations of drowning incidents vary with age, with private swimming pools and bathtubs being the most common sites for young victims. 'The Drowning Pool', a drama starring Paul Newman, is available for streaming on certain platforms. Although Tom provides psychological testimony at the trial, he takes the opportunity to assist further. In 'The Hottest August', a New York City taxi driver is offered a substantial sum to drive a passenger cross-country to the desert, initiating a passionate, tumultuous affair. This list presents the most relevant, recent, and highly-rated films related to drowning. Explicit underwater porn videos featuring drowning can be found on Thumbzilla. 'Drowning Love', based on George Asakura's manga series, captures the raw, alternating ecstasy and frustration of young love.\n\nAn admirer of both Josh Charles and Julia Stiles, I remain astounded by the conclusion of 'The Drowning', the fourth cinematic work from Bette Gordon, adapted from Pat Barker's acclaimed novel. This psychological thriller narrates the tale of a forensic psychologist haunted by his past. While not flawless, I believe it offers valuable insight into the film's poignant narrative. The protagonist hails from a wealthy, respected family. 'The Drowning', released in 2016, stars Josh Charles, Julia Stiles, and Avan Jogia, and is a joint American-Hong Kong production. In 'The Drowning', a New Orleans oil heiress engages private investigator Lew Harper to investigate a blackmail plot. Meanwhile, in 'Teenage Kicks', a gay-themed film, a young man's sexual awakening is explored. Child psychologist Tom Seymour's testimony was instrumental in convicting a boy of murder. If one streaming server is unavailable, others can be switched to.

In contrast, games like roulette offer straightforward gameplay with no special knowledge or strategy required.\n\nCasino Games' Profitability and House Edge\nOnline casinos can be profitable, as evidenced by established platforms like El Royale Casino. However, the profitability of individual games varies greatly. The house edge, the casino's advantage over players, ranges from as low as 0.5% in games like blackjack to higher percentages in other games.\n\nPopular Games and Variations\nThe Three Card Poker game, based on the classic poker game, is a relative newcomer to the casino scene but has gained significant popularity. Poker, in its various forms (Texas Hold'em, Omaha, and Seven Card Stud), is a staple in both online and offline casinos.\n\nGames with the Best Odds\nFor games with the best odds and no need for special knowledge or strategy, roulette is an excellent choice. While the frequency of hitting jackpots in video poker varies, understanding the pay tables can help maximize your winnings.\n\nTo calculate other, more favorable probabilities, one can employ the COMBIN function in Excel or Lotus, with n representing the total number of items, and r the number to choose. In each round, players decide whether to'stand pat' (keep their current hand), 'hit' (receive additional cards),'split' (if allowed, divide their hand into two), 'double down' (double their initial bet), or'surrender' (forfeit half their bet). In non-competitive games like poker, the casino typically generates revenue through a 'rake' or commission.\n\nIn the case of Blackjack, the house edge can be as low as 1%.

Meeting wagering requirements is crucial when claiming any welcome offer.\n\nFanDuel Sportsbook Process\nThe registration process for the FanDuel sportsbook may differ slightly from that of fantasy sports, and it may involve the use of a FanDuel Sportsbook promo code. In some states, where one product is regulated but another is not, users can directly access the 'Sports' section on the FanDuel website and initiate registration. For instance, this applies to New York online sportsbooks and New York online casinos.\n\nInitial Account Creation and Exploration\n\nIf your decision to join the brand is already firm, commencing the registration process from the primary webpage is the most efficient course of action. Conversely, for those considering the FanDuel online sportsbook, an initial exploration of its content is recommended before committing to an account. The FanDuel daily fantasy sports (DFS) section follows a similar protocol; users can either register immediately or first delve into the DFS section to familiarize themselves with the platform, promotions, gameplay instructions, and user reviews.\n\nRegistration: Sportsbook vs. DFS\n\nThe registration process for both the sportsbook and DFS sections shares a similar format. However, it is crucial to note that the FanDuel Sportsbook promo code may not be applicable during DFS registration.

To acquire the FanDuel Sportsbook app, users can download the APK directly from the operator's website, ensuring they allow 'Downloads/Installs from unknown sources'. The process mirrors that for the FanDuel DFS app, also available for download from the official website. U.S. players can access the free FanDuel app on both iOS and Android devices. Alternatively, users can opt for browser-based access via any mobile web browser, as FanDuel offers a mobile-optimized website that facilitates bonuses and promo code usage.\n\nFanDuel Promotions FAQs\n\nGiven the extensive reach of FanDuel's platform and services, we address some frequently asked questions:\n\nIs the FanDuel promo code authentic?\nNot all FanDuel promo codes are functional.

{"text": "As of 31 July 2021, Ferguson plc, a company incorporated in the Channel Islands, Jersey, and headquartered at 1020 Eskdale Road, Winnersh Triangle, Wokingham, Berkshire, RG41 5TS, United Kingdom, had the following key details:\n\n- Executive Contact: Kevin Murphy, Group Chief Executive, can be reached at the aforementioned address, via telephone at +44 (0) 118927 3800, or by email at investor@fergusonplc.com.\n- Securities Registration: Ferguson plc has registered its ordinary shares of 10 pence, trading under the symbol 'FERG', on both the London Stock Exchange and the New York Stock Exchange.\n- Outstanding Shares: As of the reporting period's close, there were 222,308,366 ordinary shares outstanding.\n- Securities Act Status: The company is not a well-known seasoned issuer, as defined in Rule 405 of the Securities Act, and it has no securities registered or required to be registered under Section 12(g) of the Act, nor any securities for which there is a reporting obligation under Section 15(d) of the Act.\n\nUnless otherwise stated or the context implies differently, 'the Company' refers to Ferguson plc, with 'Ferguson', 'Group', 'we', 'us', 'our', and similar terms encompassing Ferguson plc and its subsidiaries.\n\nFORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\nThis annual report contains forward-looking information, as defined by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, which carries risks, assumptions, and uncertainties that could significantly diverge from actual outcomes. Forward-looking statements encompass all non-historical data, including but not limited to, projections about our future financial status, operational results and growth, anticipated U.S. investor interest and ownership of our shares, plans and objectives for future capabilities, potential impacts of global and regional economic, market, and political changes, our capacity to navigate supply chain challenges and product price fluctuations, financial condition and liquidity, including our ability to repay debt and secure future financing for capital expenditures and other corporate activities, legal or regulatory developments, and statements regarding the success of our business and strategies.\n\nProspective statements, which provide insights into our company's future prospects, can be distinguished by the use of forward-looking language. This includes terms such as \"believes,\" \"estimates,\" \"anticipates,\" \"expects,\" \"forecasts,\" \"intends,\" \"continues,\" \"plans,\" \"projects,\" \"goal,\" \"target,\" \"aim,\" \"may,\" \"will,\" \"would,\" \"could\" or \"should,\" or their respective negatives or variations, and similar references to future periods. These statements reflect our current beliefs, expectations, and assumptions about our business's future trajectory, strategic plans, and market conditions. However, it is essential to note that these statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to uncertainties and risks.\n\nAs such, we advise against placing undue reliance on these prospective statements. While we have grounds to believe that our assumptions are reasonable, we acknowledge that numerous factors could cause our actual financial results or operational outcomes to differ significantly from those projected in these statements. These factors include, but are not limited to:\n\n- Economic downturns, market fluctuations, uncertainties, and other external conditions in the markets where we operate, which are beyond our control.\n- Adverse impacts stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic or related variants.\n- Declining demand for our products due to intense industry competition and the impact of decreasing repair, maintenance, and improvement (RMI) markets, as well as the new construction market.\n- Our inability to swiftly identify or effectively respond to evolving consumer preferences, expectations, or trends.\n- Failure of critical information technology systems or processes, as well as exposure to fraud or theft due to payment-related risks.\n- Ineffective execution of our operational strategies.\n- Our inability to attract, retain, and motivate key associates.\n- Disruptions or inefficiencies in our international supply chain or fulfillment network, including inventory delays, increased delivery costs, or stock shortages.\n\n•Intrinsic hazards linked to acquisitions, alliances, joint ventures, and other corporate mergers, divestments, or strategic transactions;\n•Regulatory, product liability, and brand reputation risks, exacerbated by suppliers' or manufacturers' errors or inefficiencies leading to subpar product quality;\n•Legal disputes and non-compliance with domestic and international laws, coupled with unexpected developments like litigation;\n•Fluctuations in, interpretations of, or adherence to tax laws in the U.S., U.K., Switzerland, or Canada;\n•Data privacy and security breaches, including incidents due to data corruption, cyberattacks, or network vulnerabilities;\n•Exposure of associates, contractors, clients, suppliers, and others to health and safety risks;\n•Pension funding risks tied to defined benefit plans;\n•Lease renewal challenges and obligations under applicable lease agreements;\n•Ineffective management and protection of facilities and inventory;\n•Debt-related risks and changes in credit ratings and outlooks;\n•Volatility in share price and shareholder base due to the planned relocation of primary listing to the U.S.; and\n•Other risks and uncertainties detailed under the \"Risk Factors\" section of this annual report.\n\nMoreover, this annual report includes further details that investors should scrutinize before purchasing our common shares. The risks and uncertainties outlined below are not exhaustive; unanticipated or currently deemed insignificant risks could also negatively impact our business, financial status, and operational results. Should any of the potential events enumerated below transpire, our business, financial health, and operational outcomes could suffer significantly, potentially leading to a decline in our share price and partial or total loss of investment.\n\nThis report also presents forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may vary materially from those projected in these statements due to various factors, including the risks detailed below and elsewhere in this report.\n\nBusiness-related Risks\nEconomic downturns, market trends, uncertainty, and other prevailing conditions in our operating markets, especially in the United States, may adversely affect the profitability and financial stability of our customers, which could subsequently hinder our sales growth and operational results.\n\nOur fiscal success is heavily influenced by trends within our industry and broader economic conditions, encompassing the status of residential, commercial, civil/infrastructure, and industrial markets, as well as shifts in gross domestic product (GDP) in regions where we operate, notably the United States, which accounted for 94% of our revenue from continuing operations in fiscal 2021. We cater to multiple end markets where demand for our products is sensitive to construction activity, capital expenditure, and our customers' product demand. Many of these customers operate in cyclical markets subject to fluctuations due to market uncertainty, cost of goods sold, currency exchange rates, foreign competition, offshoring of production, oil and natural gas prices, geopolitical developments, wage inflation, and other external factors.\n\nAdverse conditions or uncertainty in our operating markets, the economy, or political climate could negatively impact our end market customers' confidence or financial health, leading them to delay purchases, alter construction plans, or struggle to pay for products. Beyond these, factors such as unemployment, mortgage delinquency and foreclosure rates, inventory loss due to theft, interest rate and foreign currency fluctuations, labor and healthcare costs, financing availability, changes in real estate industry tax laws, supply chain or fulfillment network disruptions, weather events, cybersecurity incidents, natural disasters, terrorism, global pandemics like COVID-19, international trade tensions, and geopolitical uncertainties could significantly harm our business, financial health, and operational results.\n\nSeveral events, such as economic downturns or market fluctuations, could hinder our customers' ability to make full, on-time payments or decrease their purchases from us. This could, in turn, intensify pressure on our prices and sales terms, potentially impacting revenue growth and operational results. Furthermore, we may need to shut down underperforming branches or showrooms due to unfavorable economic conditions or weak market performance, which could significantly harm our business, financial status, and operational results.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic, which began in Wuhan, China, in December 2019 and was declared a global pandemic by the World Health Organization in March 2020, has already negatively affected various economic sectors. If it persists or worsens, it could have a substantial and adverse impact on our business and operational results. Governments worldwide, including those in the United States, United Kingdom, and Canada, have implemented strict measures to combat COVID-19, such as travel restrictions, gathering limits, and workplace closures, while encouraging social distancing. Although some restrictions have been lifted, others remain in place, and due to the unpredictable nature of the pandemic, including the emergence of new variants, it is possible that these measures could be reinstated.\n\nIn 2020, due to government mandates and voluntary decisions, the Company temporarily shut down several U.S. showrooms, transitioning to virtual consultations and online/telephone orders with in-store pickup. By mid-June, showrooms reopened with safety measures in place. However, the pandemic's unpredictability may necessitate future closures, potentially impacting revenues. Staff shortages due to illness, legal requirements, or self-isolation could disrupt operations and negatively affect business, financial status, and operations. Revenue loss or inadequate response to the pandemic's evolving environment could have significant adverse effects. Supply chain disruptions and delays, exacerbated by trade policy changes, could also impact business, financial condition, and operations. The pandemic's economic impact on the U.S. and Canada, including government stimulus programs, remains uncertain, posing further risks to the Company's future.\n\nIn the early stages of the 2020 pandemic, our Company took swift measures to safeguard its liquidity and cash flow. This included temporarily halting merger and acquisition activities, rescinding the interim dividend slated for April 2020, and suspending the share buyback program. Subsequently, these programs were reinstated, but we remain prepared to modify them again if necessary.\n\nBeyond these measures, the COVID-19 pandemic presents additional risks. These include potential disruptions to our IT systems, increased cyber threats, heightened volatility in foreign exchange and inflation rates, and changes in relevant tax laws. There is a risk that we may not fully pass on cost increases due to sustained inflation to our customers. International travel restrictions may also impact our ability to maintain UK tax residency, potentially leading to taxes on unrealized gains and withholding taxes on dividends and interest from certain subsidiaries. Any of these factors could significantly affect our business, financial status, and operations, and exacerbate other risks.\n\nThe sectors we operate in are highly competitive, and changes in this landscape, including consolidation, could lead to decreased demand for our products and services, significantly impacting our sales and profitability.\n\nIn all sectors we serve, we encounter competition from various sources, including manufacturers who are also our suppliers, wholesalers, distributors, retailers, and online businesses that leverage price transparency. The emergence of low-cost, transactional business models and new technologies has disrupted other industries, posing a threat to our operations. Should prominent online marketplace companies, with larger customer bases, stronger brands, and greater resources, target our markets, it could significantly impact our business, financial status, and operational results. These competitors might employ aggressive pricing and marketing strategies, and invest heavily in website and system development, potentially leading to reduced revenue, lower margins, profitability, market share, and brand recognition. As e-commerce continues to grow globally, competition is expected to intensify.\n\nIndustry consolidation, driven by customers' focus on total fulfillment costs and consistent supply sources, could lead to increased competition as economies of scale are achieved. Moreover, our suppliers, now selling directly to customers, pose a competitive threat. They can often undercut our prices while maintaining higher gross margins, potentially impacting our sales, margins, profitability, market share, and brand recognition negatively.\n\nTo counter competitive pressures, we are employing technology as a key means to enhance customer service and develop time- and cost-saving tools for our clients. However, these investments may not yield anticipated benefits, and our initiatives may not succeed. Moreover, failure to effectively implement strategies, including the development or acquisition of new business models or technologies, or to anticipate future market trends, could significantly impact our revenue and profitability.\n\nWe may struggle to swiftly identify or adequately address consumer preferences, trends, or expectations, which could strain customer relationships, harm our reputation, decrease product demand, and erode our market share.\n\nOur business's success hinges on our ability to promptly recognize and respond to shifting demographic trends, customer preferences, and expectations, while maintaining appropriate inventory levels and delivering superior customer experiences. For instance, our customers currently grapple with a shortage of skilled trade professionals and a need for enhanced construction productivity. Predicting future customer needs and preferences is challenging, and each of our primary end markets has distinct and evolving needs and expectations.\n\nTo cater to these diverse needs, we offer localized product assortments. If we fail to adapt and differentiate our offerings to meet the specific needs and expectations of a particular end market, we risk losing market share.\n\nWe are bolstering our e-commerce and omni-channel capabilities, along with other technological solutions, including substantial upgrades to our enterprise-wide resource planning systems. These efforts aim to simplify our customer propositions, optimize our supply chain and branch network, and ultimately drive business efficiency.\n\nThe implementation of these strategic initiatives may, in the short term, introduce costs and challenges that could hinder the smooth operation of both our online and in-store services, potentially leading to stock shortages and customer dissatisfaction. Furthermore, the successful execution of these plans necessitates a substantial investment in additional IT personnel and other specialized professionals. Competition for such talent could be fierce, potentially hindering our recruitment efforts. Missteps in investment choices, implementation, or pacing could negatively impact customer relations, our reputation, product demand, and market share. Moreover, our branch and omni-channel expansion, supply chain improvements, and new IT systems might not yield the expected benefits, potentially leading to delays, cost overruns, or even failure, all of which could harm our competitive position and overall business performance.\n\nWe are susceptible to downturns in the residential and non-residential RMI markets, as well as the new construction sector. Our core markets, which focus on these sectors and generated approximately 60% of our total revenue in fiscal 2021, are influenced by broader macroeconomic trends. Economic instability, such as a housing market slowdown due to inflation, rising interest rates, or other market issues, could lead to unexpected shifts in customer preferences and purchasing behaviors, altering product demand and pricing, and ultimately impacting our operational performance.\n\nThe company's management keeps track of market activity by analyzing various metrics related to residential and commercial construction spending. In the residential sector, they use the Leading Indicator of Remodeling Activity (LIRA) to forecast short-term trends in home improvement spending in the U.S. LIRA projections indicate an increase from fiscal 2021 levels in 2022. For the commercial and infrastructure markets, management employs the American Institute of Architects Billings Index—Commercial/Industrial (AIA Billings Index) to gauge prospective construction spending. A score below 50 signifies a decline, while above 50 indicates growth. After a dip in 2020 and early 2021, the index has since risen, with the latest reading of 55.6 in August 2021.\n\nThe company's operations heavily depend on the reliability and security of its information technology systems and data. These systems handle critical business functions such as sales, customer data management, merchandise ordering, inventory replenishment, and order fulfillment. A significant disruption or failure of these systems and their backup mechanisms could result in substantial repair costs, critical data loss, and business interruptions.\n\nTo ensure optimal functioning, these IT systems and processes require periodic upkeep and updates by us or our service providers. Moreover, our systems and those of third parties we depend on are vulnerable to disruptions caused by various factors: power failures; hardware and communication breakdowns; malware; security breaches; cyber incidents, including ransomware attacks; natural disasters like fires, floods, or storms; pandemics; acts of war or terrorism; and human errors by our staff, contractors, or third-party providers. While we and these providers strive to maintain our systems effectively and mitigate risks to their integrity, security, and consistent operation, these efforts may not always succeed.\n\nOur business relies on third-party data centers and technologies to manage our cloud infrastructure and operate. If any of these services become unavailable or unable to meet our needs due to prolonged outages, closures, or unreasonable terms, expenses may rise, and our operations could be disrupted until suitable replacements are found, implemented, potentially leading to significant adverse effects on our business, financial status, and operations.\n\nIf we fail to safeguard our sensitive data and information systems against data corruption, cyber incidents, or network breaches, or if we cannot ensure adequate security in data transmission, it could significantly impact our business operations.\n\nOur world confronts a panoply of cybersecurity perils, ranging from disparate, individual forays to complex, targeted assaults, such as advanced persistent threats (APTs), directed at our organization and our ecosystem of customers, vendors, and suppliers. Cybersecurity incidents and network infiltrations encompass, but are not confined to, unauthorized access bids, malware, ransomware, denial-of-service attacks, and other digital security breaches. Cyber-attacks, orchestrated by hackers and cybercriminals, and other nefarious internet activities, are escalating, with our services, systems, and those of our outsourced providers remaining prime targets. These threats include DNS attacks, wireless network intrusions, viruses, worms, malicious software, ransomware, application-centric attacks, peer-to-peer attacks, phishing attempts, backdoor trojans, and distributed denial-of-service attacks. The tactics employed by cybercriminals to gain unauthorized data access or compromise systems evolve rapidly, often evading detection until an incident occurs.\n\nWhile we have implemented robust safeguards and engage reputable third-party providers, we have encountered and anticipate further attempts to compromise our information systems. Despite our best efforts, we may fail to protect sensitive data or maintain system integrity. Sophisticated third parties could exploit advanced methods to bypass firewalls, encryption, and other security measures. The rapid evolution of unauthorized access techniques often renders them undetectable until they are deployed against a target, making it challenging to anticipate and preempt these threats.\n\nConsequently, our operations or those of our service providers may encounter technical issues, service interruptions, delays, or complete service cessation, primarily within our information technology infrastructure. This could substantially disrupt our operations, requiring considerable time, resources, and expenditure to rectify, potentially leading to lost revenue or reduced profit margins. Moreover, if our critical information systems fail or become inaccessible, our order processing, inventory management, accounts receivable collection, and fund disbursement could be negatively impacted. Such interruptions could also incur additional costs. The loss of critical business information, including that of customers, suppliers, or associates, could disrupt operations, damage our reputation, and expose us to legal claims, potentially having a significant adverse effect on our business, financial status, and operational results.\n\nSince the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been a surge in cyber-attacks targeting businesses, with an increased frequency, scope, and potential severity. Cybercriminals are exploiting the pandemic for financial gain by employing various tactics such as ransomware and malware, including phishing schemes that use COVID-19 as bait, registering related domain names, and targeting newly established remote access and telework infrastructure. As remote work arrangements persist, our business continuity plans may be strained, introducing operational risks, including but not limited to, cybersecurity threats. As these tactics continue to evolve, we may struggle to effectively protect our operational and information technology systems and platforms, potentially incurring significant costs to modify or enhance protective measures or investigate and remediate any vulnerabilities. This could have a substantial adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operational results, and cash flows.\n\nDisruptions or inefficiencies in our domestic or international supply chains and product fulfillment networks, triggered by any cause, including shifts in trade policies, could significantly impact our business, financial status, and operational outcomes. We engage in global sourcing, distribution, and sales, with approximately 34,000 suppliers worldwide, making their reliable and efficient order fulfillment crucial to our success.\n\nVarious factors beyond our control, such as financial instability among key suppliers, political or labor unrest in source countries, fluctuations in supply chain costs (including fuel, labor, and currency exchange rates), port labor disputes, pandemics like COVID-19, weather events, natural disasters, work stoppages, shipping capacity constraints, changes in trade policies, retaliatory trade restrictions, tariffs, and transport availability and costs, could negatively affect our business if they seriously hinder product movement or increase costs.\n\nAs our fulfillment capabilities expand or shift, our network becomes more complex, making it increasingly challenging to operate. If our network malfunctions or suppliers fail to meet commitments, we may face inventory delays, increased delivery costs, or stockouts, all of which could lead to reduced revenue and decreased customer confidence, adversely impacting our operational results.\n\nMoreover, existing suppliers might choose to supply products directly to end-users who are our current or potential customers, which could hinder our ability to retain and acquire customers, maintain and win business, and thus have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operational outcomes.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has instigated travel and work restrictions, both domestically and internationally, leading to significant disruptions and delays in global supply chains. These obstacles, which could potentially intensify based on the pandemic's trajectory and the emergence of new variants, have notably impacted and may continue to affect our suppliers and manufacturers. This has made it challenging for our suppliers to procure materials, produce goods, and export products from affected regions. Consequently, we have experienced and may continue to face supply chain disruptions and delays, which could negatively impact our business and financial performance. Even if we manage to secure alternative sources, increased costs could adversely affect our profitability and financial status.\n\nThe successful execution of our operational strategies is crucial, and any failure could have a substantial adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operational results.\n\nThe development and adaptation of our operating model is vital for driving profitable growth. However, there is a risk that we may not be sufficiently agile in adjusting our operating model, leading to an inability to adapt to evolving customer preferences or flex our cost base when necessary. Failure to adequately address these risks could tarnish our reputation and have a significant adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and operational results.\n\nTo maintain competitiveness, we must successfully attract, retain, and motivate our key associates. Failure to do so could have an adverse effect on our business, operational results, and financial condition.\n\nWe rely on our executive officers and senior management to oversee our businesses. As we evolve new business models and ways of working, it is essential to develop appropriate skill sets within our organization. Furthermore, as we continue to implement strategic change programs, including corporate migrations, it is crucial to retain existing skill sets, talent, and culture. Failure to do so could delay the execution of strategic change programs, result in the loss of institutional knowledge, and reduce our supply of future management talent.\n\nThe Corporation routinely engages in negotiations for employment and non-competition agreements with pivotal personnel of acquired companies to preserve key client relationships and oversee the transition of the assimilated business. The departure of senior management and other critical personnel, or the inability to recruit and retain qualified replacements, generally and in the context of executing key business strategies, including corporate migrations, could have a detrimental impact on the Corporation's business, financial status, and operational results.\n\nMoreover, the Corporation's capacity to deliver high-quality products, advice, and services in a timely manner is heavily reliant on maintaining an adequate number of qualified associates, including those in managerial, technical, sales, marketing, and support roles. Consequently, the Corporation's ability to enhance productivity, profitability, and support growth strategies may be constrained by its capacity to hire, train, motivate, and retain skilled personnel. This capacity may be further hindered by present or future restructuring and cost-saving initiatives. In the current tight labor market, the Corporation faces intense competition in attracting and retaining skilled personnel, such as those with specialized skills and hourly workers, which may extend the recruitment cycle. While retention rates have remained largely unchanged, the Corporation has experienced, and may continue to experience, prolonged lead times in filling more transient roles. If the tight labor market persists, this could increase the costs associated with maintaining the workforce.\n\nThe workforce constitutes a substantial portion of the Corporation's cost base. Current wage inflation, along with potential changes in applicable laws and regulations or other factors, such as labor union activity, resulting in increased labor costs, could have a materially adverse effect on the Corporation's business, financial condition, and operational results.\n\nSeveral of our products incorporate substantial quantities of commodity-priced raw materials, principally plastic, copper, and steel, along with other components susceptible to price fluctuations in the commodities market. Additionally, shifts in fuel prices can influence transportation expenses, while capacity constraints in shipping and related variations in freight rates and space availability further impact product costs. The COVID-19 pandemic's global economic impact has contributed to these price increases. Our capacity to adjust prices promptly in response to these fluctuations is contingent upon market conditions, fixed costs, and other factors. Should circumstances necessitate adjustments to our product prices and operational strategies to reflect volatile prices (inflation/deflation), there is no guarantee of their effectiveness, which could significantly harm our business, financial status, and operational results. For instance, we augmented inventory levels this year to ensure product availability, and our inability to promptly pass on all or part of product price inflation to customers could decrease our profit margins. Furthermore, our efforts to monitor for signs of moderation or deflation may prove ineffective, potentially leading to inventory write-downs.\n\nBusiness combinations, such as acquisitions, partnerships, joint ventures, divestments, and other strategic transactions, inherently carry risks that could prevent the anticipated benefits from materializing and adversely affect our business, financial status, and operational results. Acquisitions, a key component of our growth strategy, often involve mergers, acquisitions, investments, and other expansion strategies. We regularly engage in these transactions, expecting them to yield increased sales, cost savings, synergies, and other benefits.\n\nOver the course of fiscal years 2021, 2020, and 2019, we finalized a total of 7, 6, and 15 acquisitions, respectively. However, the anticipated benefits from these transactions may not materialize, and we could face additional liabilities or litigation from the acquired businesses or joint ventures. Moreover, identifying suitable acquisition targets in the future may prove challenging. The success of our strategic transactions is contingent upon various uncertainties and risks, including accurate acquisition assumptions, successful integration of personnel, systems, and operations, and avoiding disruption to our ongoing business and management distraction. Effective internal controls are crucial for reliable financial reporting, but integrating businesses can complicate these systems and potentially lead to non-compliance with financial reporting obligations. Impairment of goodwill or other assets, or charges associated with strategic transactions, could significantly reduce our profitability. Post-integration, acquired businesses may not generate expected margins or cash flows. Shareholders, vendors, or customers may react negatively to substantial strategic transactions. Furthermore, financing these transactions through additional debt or equity could increase leverage or impact our future capital access.\n\nAs our brand's product portfolio grows organically and through strategic acquisitions, we face amplified risks due to our enhanced role in product design, marketing, and sales. These risks encompass increased regulatory compliance burdens, augmented product liability and recall exposure, and elevated reputational risks tied to responsible sourcing. To effectively distinguish our brand, we must also safeguard our intellectual property and adeptly navigate third-party proprietary rights. Moreover, increased sales of our brand's products could negatively impact our suppliers' sales, potentially straining our supplier relationships. Inadequately addressing these risks could impair our reputation and adversely affect our business, operational results, and financial standing.\n\nMaintaining a high standard of product quality is crucial, as any lapses due to suppliers' or manufacturers' errors or inefficiencies could tarnish our reputation and negatively impact our business, financial condition, and operational results.\n\nTo sustain success, we must continually enhance and leverage our brand's value in the market. Our brand's reputation, largely based on subjective perceptions, can be eroded by isolated high-profile incidents, such as product recalls, or the cumulative effect of seemingly minor incidents. Such occurrences, if accompanied by adverse publicity, government investigations, or litigation, could tarnish our brand and have detrimental effects on our business.\n\nOur product quality can be compromised due to the actions or inactions of our suppliers or manufacturers, which could erode customer trust in our brands and products. Since we lack direct oversight of their manufacturing processes, we face risks associated with product quality. If our products fail to meet safety standards or customer expectations, or are suspected of causing harm, we may face decreased revenue, higher costs, and legal, financial, and reputational risks, as well as government interventions. Product safety concerns, real or perceived, could also lead to expensive recalls.\n\nWe strive to sign contracts with suppliers that indemnify us against costs related to defective products. However, there's no guarantee these contractual rights will be enforceable or sufficient, or that we'll successfully assert related claims.\n\nIf we fail to secure supplier rebates or maintain existing arrangements, our operational results could significantly worsen. Many of our products are procured under rebate agreements that offer discounts based on specified purchases. Some agreements require minimum purchase quantities, offering higher rebates for larger purchases. These rebates effectively lower our product costs, and we manage our business to capitalize on these programs. However, these agreements are subject to periodic renegotiation, and supplier consolidation may lead to the reduction or elimination of rebate programs. If we fail to qualify for these rebates, or if suppliers significantly reduce or stop offering them, our costs could substantially increase, negatively impacting our gross margins and income.\n\nGeopolitical trade obstacles, either regionally or globally, could hike our product prices, potentially undermining their competitiveness and negatively affecting our financial performance. Tensions between the U.S. and China, escalating since 2018, have seen both nations impose tariffs on each other's goods, with U.S. rates ranging from 10% to 25% and Chinese rates from 5% to 10%. A 'Phase One' deal was struck in December 2019, but most tariffs persist. The current U.S. administration has hinted at using tariffs to combat unfair trade practices, leaving the future of international trade agreements uncertain.\n\nOur operations and financial health may be influenced by shifts in trade policies, including tariffs and international commerce regulations. The potential reduction or removal of certain trade barriers and their deflationary consequences could impact our business, financial status, and operational results. The existing U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods, coupled with geopolitical tensions between the U.S. and China (a crucial market for our product sourcing) and the U.S. and the European Union, have led to increased product costs, potentially undermining our competitiveness and affecting our business, financial health, operational results, and cash flow. The long-term impact of the current U.S. administration on a comprehensive U.S.-China tariff agreement or U.S.-EU trade tensions remains uncertain.\n\nOur business is exposed to various risks due to its local and global nature, including domestic and foreign laws, regulations, and standards. Non-compliance with these or unexpected events like litigation could adversely affect our operations.\n\nOur enterprise functions across the United States, Canada, and various global regions, such as China, Taiwan, India, Thailand, Vietnam, and Italy, exposing us to unique operational risks and regulatory landscapes. We comply with a broad spectrum of domestic and international legal frameworks, including advertising and marketing guidelines, anti-bribery and anti-money laundering laws, competition regulations, data protection standards (including PCI-DSS), cybersecurity mandates, environmental laws, foreign exchange controls, government contracting rules, import/export stipulations, intellectual property laws, labor regulations, product compliance requirements, supplier regulations, tax and zoning laws, unclaimed property laws, and other commercial standards. Notably, occupational health and safety, or consumer product safety regulations, may necessitate corrective actions, such as product recalls, which can incur substantial expenses and consume significant management and personnel time. Furthermore, we routinely undergo audits and investigations conducted by government agencies as part of our standard business operations.\n\nNon-adherence to the specified laws, regulations, and standards may incur civil or criminal liabilities, financial penalties, and non-financial repercussions, potentially tarnishing the Company's image. Alterations in these legal frameworks or their interpretations could escalate operational costs, necessitating additional investments in technology and process development. Although we have established compliance policies and procedures, there is no guarantee that employees, contractors, or agents will not contravene these rules or our internal guidelines. A product recall or other corrective measures could undermine customer trust in the relevant Group member's products and the Group as a whole, regardless of their successful implementation. Any such non-compliance or violation could individually or collectively have a significant adverse impact on our business, financial status, operational results, and cash flow.\n\nChanges in, or interpretations of, U.S., U.K., Swiss, or Canadian tax laws could likewise have a materially adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operational results, and cash flow. As a multinational corporation, we are subject to taxation in these jurisdictions, and increases in U.S. federal income tax rates or tax rates in other countries of operation, or changes to the global tax system, could negatively impact our business, financial status, and operational results. Tax laws, regulations, and administrative practices in various jurisdictions can undergo substantial changes, with or without prior notice, due to economic, political, or other factors, requiring significant judgment in assessing and estimating our provisions and accruals for these taxes.\n\nOur effective tax rates may be influenced by a multitude of factors, such as alterations in tax legislation, regulatory frameworks, administrative practices, principles, and interpretations. Proposed changes to corporate tax rules, including an elevated corporate income tax rate, a minimum tax on book income, and modifications that could generally increase the tax rates applicable to a U.S. corporation's international income, could significantly impact our tax liabilities and effective tax rate. Furthermore, an impending higher UK tax rate in 2023, proposed increases in U.S. federal tax rates, and the OECD's global minimum tax initiative could lead to a short-term increase in the Group's consolidated effective tax rate. The unpredictability of tax law changes makes it challenging to forecast their potential material adverse effects on our business, financial status, operations, and cash flows.\n\nThe interpretation and application of tax law are subject to discretion and may be scrutinized by tax authorities. Administrative guidance may be incomplete or diverge from legislative intent, rendering the application of tax law uncertain. While we maintain that our reported positions align with relevant tax laws and regulations, tax authorities may interpret our application differently, potentially leading to previously unrecorded tax expenses, higher future tax expenses, or the assessment of interest and penalties.\n\nWe are obligated to uphold the privacy and security of personal information in accordance with global privacy and data protection regulations. Failure to comply could jeopardize our business and damage our reputation with customers, suppliers, and associates.\n\nOur organization's operations heavily depend on IT infrastructure, networks, and services, some of which are outsourced to third-party providers, safeguarding our sensitive information. The escalating information security threats and evolving threat actors pose substantial risks to our information security strategies. Moreover, we handle, store, and process personal data of our customers, suppliers, and associates, which is increasingly governed by a myriad of U.S. and international laws and regulations. These include the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in the EU and UK, Canada's Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA), the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), Virginia's Consumer Data Protection Act, and other emerging global and state-specific privacy and cybersecurity laws, each carrying potential penalties for non-adherence.\n\nIllustratively, the CCPA, enacted in the U.S. in January 2020, has empowered California consumers with more control over their personal data, granting them new privacy rights and imposing data protection obligations on businesses. Non-compliance by businesses like ours could result in class action lawsuits and per-incident fines. These data privacy and protection laws primarily aim to safeguard personal data within their respective jurisdictions, often extending to cross-border transactions and intercompany data transfers. While we have and continue to dedicate significant resources to comply with these regulations, many are novel, intricate, and open to interpretation. Non-compliance could lead to adverse publicity, reputational damage, penalties, or substantial legal liabilities. We could also be impacted if legislations or regulations expand, or if jurisdictions interpret or implement them unfavorably towards our business practices.\n\nCorporate accountability, particularly in the realms of environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors, can entail extra expenses and present novel risks. The expectation for public ESG and sustainability reporting is growing among investors, shareholders, and other stakeholders. Organizations specializing in corporate governance and risk information are developing, or may in the future, scores and ratings to assess companies and investment funds based on ESG or sustainability metrics. Many investment funds prioritize positive ESG business practices and high sustainability scores when making investment decisions, considering these as reputational or other significant factors. Moreover, investors, especially institutional ones, use these scores to compare companies with their peers. If a company is perceived as underperforming, these investors may engage with the company to enhance ESG disclosure or performance, and may also influence voting decisions or take other actions to hold corporations and their boards accountable. Board diversity, an ESG topic, is gaining particular attention from investors, shareholders, lawmakers, and listing exchanges. Failure to meet the ESG standards set by these constituencies, or to achieve an acceptable ESG or sustainability rating, could result in reputational damage. A low rating could also lead to the exclusion of our ordinary shares from consideration by certain investors who might choose to invest with our competitors instead. The ongoing focus on corporate responsibility matters by investors and other parties may thus impose additional costs or expose us to new risks. Furthermore, our operations may expose our associates, contractors, customers, suppliers, and other individuals to health and safety risks, potentially leading to property, casualty, or other losses not covered by our insurance policies.\n\nOur business activities may subject our employees, vendors, clients, suppliers, and other individuals to various health and safety hazards, including possible exposure to COVID-19 and its variants, which could result in fatalities, severe injuries, or illnesses. These risks also encompass potential legal action from third parties. Notably, in the United States, the likelihood of litigation is typically elevated compared to other regions of our operations, particularly in areas such as workers' compensation, general liability, and environmental and asbestos-related lawsuits.\n\nOur past business operations have exposed us to asbestos-related claims, primarily via indemnification suits, for which we've set aside $64 million in environmental and legal provisions on our balance sheet as of July 31, 2021. Future periods may bring cash outlays or earnings charges if these litigations conclude unfavorably, or if our accounting estimates prove inaccurate. Several factors could alter actual outcomes, such as:\n\n(i) Upticks in asbestos claims against our subsidiaries, or unfavorable trends in their filings;\n(ii) Rising resolution costs due to adverse trends in settlement expenses, dismissal rates, legal fees, or judgment sizes;\n(iii) Reduced insurance coverage due to policy reinterpretations or insurer insolvency;\n(iv) New trends or legal theories expanding the potential claimant pool, or novel procedural mechanisms facilitating their claims;\n(v) Bankruptcies of other companies imposing shared liability on our subsidiaries;\n(vi) Unpredictable aspects of the litigation process;\n(vii) Shifts in the mix of asbestos-related diseases subject to claims against our subsidiaries;\n(viii) Potential legislative changes; and\n(ix) Changes in the discount rate used for liability determination.\n\nWhile we maintain what we believe to be sufficient insurance for various risks, including product liability, operational health and safety, and vehicle/driver-related claims across jurisdictions, there's no guarantee this coverage will be adequate. Insufficient contractual indemnification or insurance could significantly impact our business, financial condition, and operational results.\n\nOur business, like many, is subject to ongoing and potential future legal disputes, which, due to their inherent unpredictability, could unfavorably influence our operations, financial status, earnings, and cash flow. These cases, ranging from consumer to employment litigation, may necessitate specific actions or inactions, potentially leading to substantial verdicts or expenses, and could divert management's focus and harm our reputation.\n\nMoreover, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, notably the U.S. dollar against the Canadian dollar and British Pound, stemming from routine business transactions, could negatively impact our reported operational results. The increased volatility in these currencies, partly due to the COVID-19 pandemic, further amplifies this risk.\n\nLastly, our defined benefit pension plans pose funding risks, which could potentially impact our financial health.\n\nThe organization manages a range of pension plans, encompassing both funded and unfunded defined benefit schemes in Canada and the United Kingdom. The pension trustees and plan sponsors strive to align the liabilities with a portfolio of assets, which consists of equity and debt securities, along with diversified growth assets, and additional investments designed to mitigate the underlying interest and inflation risk associated with the liabilities. The United Kingdom Plan, the organization's largest defined benefit plan, has been closed to future service accrual and is secured by a buy-in insurance policy that covers a substantial portion of the existing pensioner population. The market value of these assets can fluctuate over time, thereby influencing the funding position of the plan.\n\nAccounting-wise, the Group's pension plans' liabilities are valued using discount rates tied to corporate bond yields, which can fluctuate notably between reporting periods. As of July 31, 2021, our balance sheet showed a net pension asset of $108 million for the UK Plan, a stark contrast to the $27 million net pension liability recorded the previous year. Meanwhile, our Canadian defined benefit plans reported net pension liabilities of $12 million and $34 million, respectively, as of July 31, 2021 and 2020. In compliance with UK pensions regulations, the UK Plan underwent its triennial actuarial valuation in 2019, leading to a deficit reduction plan agreed upon with the trustees in 2020. Consequently, the Group contributed £30 million (£10 million in 2020 and £20 million in 2021) to address the deficit. Post the disposal of its shares in Wolseley UK Limited on January 29, 2021, the Group retained responsibility for the UK Plan's ongoing liabilities, as they were not transferred to the new owner.\n\nIn the wake of divesting its Nordic operations in March 2018, the Group injected a one-off sum of $94 million into the United Kingdom Plan. Similarly, upon the disposal of its UK business in January 2021, the Group opted to contribute an additional one-off amount of $26 million to the same plan. No further deficit reduction contributions are currently anticipated, but a new plan may be established post the upcoming triennial actuarial assessment in April 2022, should it be deemed necessary. Potential future payments, triggered by factors like economic downturns or shifts in actuarial assumptions, could negatively impact our financial status. Furthermore, interventions by the Pensions Regulator, pension plan trustees, or significant changes in pension legislation could mandate immediate or short-term additional costs, which could likewise negatively affect our financial condition. Changes in our credit ratings and outlook may potentially limit access to capital and escalate borrowing costs.\n\nThe Company's creditworthiness assessments, conducted by external agencies, are influenced by several factors, both intrinsic (such as our financial robustness) and extrinsic (like industry-wide conditions or changes in rating practices). The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic presents a potential threat to our credit ratings, which could, in turn, negatively impact our access to capital and increase our borrowing costs. We cannot guarantee that our current ratings will persist or that they won't be downgraded, suspended, or withdrawn entirely. Such actions by rating agencies could lead to a decrease in the market price or liquidity of our securities. Increased leverage due to higher shareholder payouts, larger acquisitions, or a deterioration in creditworthiness metrics could also exert pressure on our ratings. Changes in ratings could hinder our ability to secure capital on favorable terms, obtain adequate financing, and increase our future financing costs.\n\nOur operations are largely housed in short-term, non-cancelable leased facilities. We may struggle to renew these leases on favorable terms or at all, and closing a facility might not absolve us of our lease obligations.\n\nMost of our branches are situated in leased premises, with many current leases being non-cancelable and spanning approximately five years, often with renewal options. There's no assurance that we'll be able to renew our current or future leases on favorable terms or at all, which could hinder our business operations and impact our financial results. Furthermore, if we close or cease using a facility, we generally remain obligated to fulfill our lease commitments, including base rent payments for the remaining lease term.\n\nWe face risks associated with the management and protection of our facilities and inventory.\n\nOur global footprint encompasses offices, showrooms, counters, warehouses, and distribution centers, each potentially vulnerable to criminal activities that could adversely affect our operations, financial standing, or public image. While our security and audit measures strive for comprehensiveness, they cannot guarantee absolute prevention of incidents such as break-ins, theft, property damage, or workplace violence. The current geopolitical instability and social unrest heighten the risk of significant facility damage, inventory loss, or personal injury to our stakeholders in the event of a security breach. Inventory controls and facility security may falter, leading to inventory shrinkage or loss due to inadequate tracking or misconduct by associates, customers, vendors, or other external parties. Furthermore, our dispersed inventory across various facilities and branches may result in inaccuracies in recording inventory existence and condition. Security incidents, inventory loss, or inaccurate record-keeping could collectively impact our business, financial health, operational results, or reputation negatively. Payment-related risks expose us to increased operating costs, fraud or theft, potential liabilities, and business disruptions.\n\nOur company accommodates a multitude of payment methods, encompassing trade credit, cash, checks, credit and debit cards, PayPal, and gift cards, with the possibility of introducing new options in the future. Utilizing these payment channels exposes us to a spectrum of regulations, contractual obligations, and compliance requirements, such as payment network rules, data security standards, and electronic funds transfer regulations. These guidelines are subject to change or reinterpretation, potentially increasing the complexity and cost of adherence. For certain payment types, notably credit and debit cards, we incur interchange and other fees, which may escalate over time, thereby elevating our operational costs. We depend on third-party providers for payment processing services, including credit and debit card processing, and any disruption in their services or system compromises could potentially impact our business operations.\n\nThe payment methods we offer also expose us to potential fraud and theft perpetrated by increasingly sophisticated criminals seeking to exploit vulnerabilities in payment systems. Non-compliance with applicable rules or requirements, or a breach in payment-related data, may result in financial liabilities, fines, higher transaction fees, or impairment of our ability to process certain payments. Such incidents could erode customer confidence in specific payment types, leading to shifts towards alternative payment methods or modifications to our payment systems that may incur higher costs. Consequently, our business, financial status, and operational results could be negatively affected.\n\nMoreover, some of the Company's clients, vendors, or other external parties might attempt to procure goods deceitfully from, or submit false invoices to, any entity within the Group. The Company has endeavored to expand best practices by implementing several processes and controls to mitigate opportunities for fraud. Should the Company fail to detect fraudulent activities, it may incur direct losses and/or erode the trust of its customers and/or suppliers, potentially having a substantial adverse impact on the Company's operations, financial status, and operational results.\n\nAccounting standards, encompassing both International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) for fiscal 2021 and preceding years, and U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) for periods commencing August 1, 2021 onwards, along with related accounting guidelines and interpretations, present intricate challenges due to their relevance to the Company's business, such as revenue recognition, asset impairment, goodwill and intangible asset impairment, inventory management, lease obligations, self-insurance, tax matters, pensions, and litigation. These standards involve numerous subjective assumptions, estimates, and judgments. Alterations in accounting standards or their interpretation, or changes in underlying assumptions and estimates, could significantly influence the Company's reported or anticipated financial performance or financial condition.\n\nAs of 31 July 2021, our total debt stood at $2.7 billion. We anticipate incurring significant additional debt in the future, particularly in relation to potential acquisitions, which remain a key part of our growth strategy. Some of these debts may be secured against our assets. Our debt levels could negatively impact our strategy by:\n\n- Redirecting cash flow towards debt repayments, reducing funds available for reinvestment in the business.\n- Limiting our ability to secure financing for potential acquisitions.\n- Constraining our flexibility in planning and reacting to changes in our business and industry.\n- Putting us at a competitive disadvantage compared to rivals with lower debt levels.\n\nUpon maturity, we may need to refinance some or all of our debt, potentially under less favorable terms or unfavorable market conditions, which could also adversely affect our strategy.\n\nRisks Associated with Our Status as a U.S.-Listed Company and Ownership of Our Ordinary Shares\n\nWe anticipate seeking shareholder approval to relocate our primary listing to the United States, which could cause volatility in our share price and shareholder base. Currently, we maintain a premium listing on the London Stock Exchange (LSE) and are a member of the FTSE 100 index, with an additional listing on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). As previously announced, we aim to seek shareholder approval to relocate our primary listing to the United States. If we fail to achieve the required shareholder approval, this could also result in share price volatility.\n\nConversely, if we secure the necessary shareholder endorsement and proceed with a primary listing on a U.S. exchange and a standard listing on the LSE, our status as a constituent of the FTSE 100 will cease. Furthermore, upon transitioning to a primary listing on the NYSE, immediate eligibility for inclusion in certain U.S. indices is not guaranteed, as specific trading volume thresholds must first be met. Even upon meeting these criteria, inclusion in any U.S. index is not assured.\n\nConsequently, if we successfully relocate our primary listing to the United States and transition to the NYSE, certain institutional investors currently holding our ordinary shares may be compelled to divest due to changes in their investment mandates (e.g., requiring FTSE 100 status or LSE premium listing status). Similarly, certain U.S. investors may initially face restrictions on investing in our ordinary shares due to our absence from U.S.-centric indices. Such imbalances between supply and demand could lead to increased volatility in the price of our ordinary shares and potentially impact our eligibility for U.S. indices.\n\nWe will shift our financial reporting standards from International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) to U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (U.S. GAAP) for periods commencing on or after August 1, 2021. As a result, some of our financial data may not be directly comparable to our historical financial results.\n\nSubsequently, we will shift our accounting standards from International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) to U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (U.S. GAAP), commencing with fiscal periods starting August 1, 2021. In preparation, we have dedicated substantial resources and time to convert our historical IFRS-based financial statements into U.S. GAAP-compliant ones. This transition has entailed, and may continue to incur, significant legal, accounting, and other related expenses, potentially impacting our operational results negatively. Consequently, once we begin reporting under U.S. GAAP, direct comparison with our historical IFRS-based financial statements may not be feasible. The stringent demands of U.S. public company obligations, coupled with evolving laws, regulations, and standards, are introducing uncertainty for U.S. public companies, requiring substantial resources and management focus.\n\nHaving recently floated our ordinary shares on the U.S. market, we are now grappling with additional expenses, particularly in legal and accounting services, which were previously not applicable. As a public entity, we are now bound by the regulatory frameworks of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the \"Exchange Act\"), the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (\"Sarbanes-Oxley Act\"), and the listing requirements of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), among other securities rules. The Exchange Act mandates the submission of annual and other reports detailing our business, financial status, and operational results. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act necessitates the implementation and upkeep of effective internal controls and procedures for financial reporting. The demands of establishing and maintaining a U.S. public company infrastructure may, in certain instances, distract management from our growth strategy, potentially hindering our business, financial, and operational improvements. We have implemented and will continue to implement changes to our internal controls, financial reporting procedures, and accounting systems to meet our new reporting obligations. However, these measures may not fully satisfy these requirements. Moreover, compliance with these regulations has escalated our legal and financial compliance costs, making certain activities more time-consuming and expensive. These additional burdens may significantly impact our business, financial status, operational results, and cash flow.\n\nMoreover, evolving legal and regulatory landscapes surrounding corporate governance, ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) factors, and public disclosure are introducing uncertainty for U.S. public companies. These changes are escalating legal and financial compliance costs, prompting some companies to allocate resources to adhere to shifting laws, regulations, and standards. This could lead to increased operational expenses and management's diversion from revenue-generating tasks to compliance-related activities. Misinterpretations or ambiguities in applying these changes could result in regulatory actions, potentially impacting our business, financial status, operations, and cash flow adversely.\n\nOur assessment of internal controls over financial reporting, as mandated by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, remains incomplete. We are obligated to comply with Section 404's internal control evaluation and certification requirements by the close of our 2022 fiscal year. We have yet to determine if our current internal controls align with Section 404 standards. Non-compliance may necessitate implementing new internal control procedures and re-evaluating our financial reporting. This process could incur higher-than-expected operational expenses, potentially requiring additional qualified personnel. Inefficient or ineffective implementation could harm our reputation, operations, financial reporting, or financial results, leading to a conclusion that our internal controls over financial reporting are ineffective.\n\nDuring the process of drafting our fiscal 2020 consolidated financial statements, we, in conjunction with our independent auditors, discovered two significant flaws in our internal controls over financial reporting. The absence of effective internal controls could lead to inaccuracies or delays in meeting our reporting obligations, which may erode investor confidence in our company and consequently, the value of our ordinary shares. These material weaknesses were attributed to: (i) a lack of separation of duties, as an employee with administrative access to our consolidation system also possessed the ability to prepare and post manual journal entries without independent oversight, coupled with imprecision and insufficient documentation in the review of consolidation and related journal entries, and (ii) the presentation of deferred tax assets and liabilities.\n\nTo address these issues, we have implemented the following remedies: (a) revoked the administrative access from the employee in question, (b) bolstered our review of manual journal entries, ensuring a thorough and well-documented examination by an independent reviewer who lacks the ability to prepare and post such entries, and (c) strengthened our review process for the presentation of deferred taxes within our consolidated financial statements.\n\nWe have established a robust control environment to address and rectify previously identified material weaknesses in our internal controls. Although we are confident in our remediation efforts, we acknowledge that maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting may be challenging. If we fail to uphold these controls, the accuracy and timeliness of our financial reporting could be compromised, potentially impacting investor confidence and the value of our ordinary shares.\n\nMoreover, we cannot guarantee that our current and future measures will entirely prevent the recurrence of material weaknesses. If we are unable to affirm the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, or if our independent auditors cannot express an opinion on its effectiveness, investor trust in us may be eroded, potentially leading to a decline in the value of our ordinary shares.\n\nOur ordinary shares are susceptible to market price volatility, which may not always align with our operating performance. Market developments unrelated to our business could also disproportionately impact our share price.\n\nThe market price of our ordinary shares has historically been and may continue to be volatile, influenced by a multitude of factors. These include general economic conditions, variations in operating results, changes in revenue or profit estimates, market sentiment towards our industry, competitor actions, regulatory changes, and broader market volatility. Any of these factors could cause significant fluctuations in our share price, potentially resulting in investors receiving less than they invested or even a total loss.\n\nThe rights of our shareholders are governed by Jersey law, and not all shareholder rights available under U.S. law will apply to holders of our ordinary shares.\n\nThe legal rights of holders of our ordinary shares are subject to Jersey law, our founding document (the \"Memorandum\"), and our internal rules (the \"Articles\"). These may not offer the same legal clarity and transparency as incorporation in a United States state. The Company's existence is grounded in Jersey, a British crown dependency located off the coast of Normandy, France, and not part of the European Union. Jersey's company laws are primarily based on English corporate law principles, but there's no guarantee that future legal changes won't impact investors' rights adversely, especially when compared to the protections offered under U.S. corporate law.\n\nShareholders' rights under Jersey law differ from those in typical U.S. companies. Notably, Jersey law currently restricts the circumstances in which shareholders can file derivative actions, which are lawsuits brought by a shareholder on behalf of the company against a third party. Typically, only the Company itself can initiate such proceedings, and individual shareholders or groups lack this right. However, there are judicial exceptions, such as \"fraud on the minority,\" where there's a strong case of equitable fraud by the defendant, and the wrongdoers controlled the company, preventing it from pursuing legal action.\n\nAccording to the Jersey Companies Law 1991, as amended, specifically Article 141, a shareholder may seek judicial intervention if they believe that the company's actions, including proposed or executed decisions, are unfairly prejudicing their interests or those of other shareholders. The Jersey court, under Article 143, can issue orders to regulate the company's affairs, prevent harmful actions, authorize legal proceedings, or facilitate share buybacks. Notably, Jersey law does not provide appraisal rights to dissenting shareholders as is common in the United States. However, shareholders can still allege violations of U.S. federal securities laws.\n\nAs a foreign private issuer, we are not bound by U.S. proxy rules but are subject to Exchange Act reporting obligations, which are generally less stringent and less frequent than those imposed on U.S. issuers.\n\nCurrently, we comply with the Exchange Act as a non-US entity, designated as a 'foreign private issuer' per Rule 3b-4. This status exempts us from specific Exchange Act provisions applicable to US public companies, including:\n\n- Regulations governing proxy solicitations for securities registered under the Exchange Act.\n- Mandatory insider stock ownership and trading activity disclosures, along with profit recoupment rules for short-term trades.\n- Quarterly filing requirements with the SEC, such as unaudited financial reports on Form 10-Q or event-driven reports on Form 8-K.\n\nForeign private issuers are obligated to submit their annual report on Form 20-F within 120 days post-fiscal year end, while non-accelerated US filers submit Form 10-K within 90 days. Additionally, we are exempt from Regulation Fair Disclosure, which prevents selective material information disclosure.\n\nAs a foreign private issuer, we may adhere to home country corporate governance practices instead of US issuer requirements, potentially providing less protection to our ordinary shareholders.\n\nAs a non-U.S. company listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), we are allowed to adhere to certain corporate governance practices from our home country, instead of some NYSE mandates. For details on these exemptions, refer to \"Item 16G. Corporate Governance\" in our filings. A foreign issuer, like ourselves, incorporated in Jersey and listed on the London Stock Exchange's main market, can follow our home country's practices regarding NYSE rules that necessitate shareholder approval for equity compensation plans and significant changes to them. Unlike the NYSE, Jersey and UK corporate governance norms typically do not require such shareholder approval, except in specific, limited scenarios. These home country practices might provide less protection to our ordinary shareholders compared to U.S. corporate shareholders. If we lose our foreign private issuer status in the future, we may face additional costs and expenses. Currently, as a foreign private issuer, we are not subject to the same frequent disclosure and current reporting requirements under the Exchange Act that apply to U.S. domestic issuers. Our foreign private issuer status is reassessed annually on the last business day of our second fiscal quarter, with the next review scheduled for January 31, 2022.\n\nIn forthcoming years, our status as a foreign private issuer could be rescinded if, for instance, a majority of our voting power is held by U.S. citizens or residents, and we fail to fulfill supplementary criteria to retain this status. As a U.S. domestic issuer, our regulatory and compliance expenses may escalate. If we no longer qualify as a foreign private issuer, we will be mandated to submit periodic reports and registration statements using U.S. domestic issuer forms to the SEC, which are more comprehensive than those available to foreign private issuers. We will also be obligated to adhere to U.S. federal proxy requirements, and our officers, directors, and controlling shareholders will fall under the short-swing profit disclosure and recovery provisions of Section 16 of the Exchange Act. We may also need to adjust certain policies to align with good governance practices expected of U.S. domestic issuers, incurring additional costs in the process. Furthermore, we may forfeit our ability to rely on exemptions from specific corporate governance requirements on U.S. stock exchanges that are typically available to foreign private issuers. Our capacity to distribute dividends or implement other capital returns in the future is contingent, among other factors, on our financial performance.\n\nThe historical performance of our company does not assure future results, especially given the competitive nature of our industry. Consequently, our revenues, profits, and cash flow may not meet market expectations. If cash flow falls short, our capacity to pay dividends or return capital (such as share repurchases) could be negatively affected. The Board will decide on dividend payments and capital returns, considering applicable laws, regulations, financing restrictions, our financial position, working capital needs, finance costs, economic conditions, and other significant factors.\n\nIssuing additional ordinary shares for future acquisitions, share incentive plans, or other purposes may dilute the holdings of existing shareholders.\n\nTo fund future acquisitions and growth opportunities, we may seek financing by issuing additional equity or convertible securities. This could dilute shareholders' percentage ownership or negatively impact the market price of our ordinary shares.\n\nAs a holding company with no independent operations, we rely on our subsidiaries for cash flow, including dividend payments. Our ability to pay dividends depends on the earnings and distributions from our subsidiaries, general economic conditions, and other significant factors. Our distributable reserves can be impacted by reduced profitability, asset impairments, and severe market volatility.\n\nThe Wolseley Group's inception traces back to 1887 when Frederick York Wolseley established the Wolseley Sheep Shearing Machine Company. In 1979, a strategic shift occurred as the Group divested its manufacturing entities to concentrate solely on distribution. From 1980 onwards, the Group's expansion spanned North America and Europe, facilitated by both organic growth and strategic acquisitions, including the 1982 takeover of Ferguson Enterprises, LLC. The Group's initial public offering (IPO) took place on April 14, 1986, concurrent with the ultimate holding company adopting the name Wolseley plc.\n\nThroughout the 1990s and mid-2000s, Wolseley plc continued its expansionist trajectory, entering markets such as the Netherlands, Switzerland, Ireland, Belgium, and the Nordic region, as well as further consolidating its presence in the United States and Canada. The 2009 financial crisis necessitated a comprehensive restructuring, leading to the closure of underperforming branches and the divestment of several Group businesses. The Group's focus subsequently narrowed to its core plumbing and heating markets, prioritizing shareholder returns.\n\nOn July 31, 2017, Wolseley plc rebranded as Ferguson plc to better align with its largest US subsidiary. In March 2018, the Group sold its Nordic business, Stark Group, due to a lack of synergies with its core activities. The proceeds from this sale were predominantly distributed to shareholders, leveraging the Group's robust financial position. The Group's divestment of its last remaining Central European business, Wasco (its Netherlands B2B entity), took place on January 30, 2019.\n\nOn May 10, 2019, following shareholder endorsement, the Group finalized a corporate reorganization, relocating its headquarters and the tax residence of its parent company from Switzerland to the United Kingdom. This move aimed to streamline the Group's corporate structure. Consequently, the Company became the Group's ultimate parent, and all ordinary shares of the former parent company were exchanged on a one-for-one basis for ordinary shares of the Company.\n\nOn January 29, 2021, the Group divested its UK business, allowing Ferguson to focus solely on serving customers in North America. As part of this transaction, the Group retained future responsibility for the United Kingdom's defined benefit pension plan, the Group's primary defined benefit plan in the UK.\n\nThe disposal did not necessitate significant management relocation, as most of the Company's senior management team, including its CEO and CFO, are based in the United States. Certain personnel, such as the Company Secretary, remained in the United Kingdom.\n\nOn March 8, 2021, the Company's additional U.S. listing of ordinary shares became effective, and trading commenced on the NYSE. Consequently, the Company's American Depository Receipt (ADR) program was terminated. The Group maintains its premium listing on the London Stock Exchange and is included in the FTSE 100 index. Investors can trade on both exchanges under the ticker symbol: FERG.\n\nOn May 11, 2021, the Group distributed substantially all of the net cash proceeds from the sale of the UK business to shareholders through a special dividend.\n\nThe entity's official name is Ferguson plc. It maintains tax residency in the United Kingdom. The Company's incorporation and registration occurred in Jersey on March 8, 2019, under the Jersey Companies Law, initially as a private limited company named Alpha JCo Limited, with the company number 128484. On March 26, 2019, the Company transitioned to a public limited company and changed its name to Ferguson Newco plc. The final name change to Ferguson plc took place on May 10, 2019. The Company's primary operational legislation is the Jersey Companies Law and its subsequent regulations. Although not subject to the UK Companies Act 2006 (CA 2006) due to its Jersey incorporation, the Company upholds CA 2006's governance and corporate responsibility standards and adheres to the UK Corporate Governance Code.\n\nIn the United States, the Company's operations predominantly occur under the Ferguson brand. In Canada, the Wolseley brand is predominantly used. For detailed information about the Company's principal business segments in various geographic markets, refer to \"Item 4. Information on the Company—B. Business Overview\".\n\nFor a description of the Company's capital expenditures, refer to \"Item 5. Operating and Financial Review and Prospects—B. Liquidity and Capital Resources—Debt Facilities—Capital expenditure\".\n\nAs per the informational requirements of the Exchange Act, the Company files reports and other information with the SEC. The SEC maintains an online platform at  where reports, proxy statements, and other information regarding registrants, including the Company, are accessible. Additionally, the Company's website hosts these reports and other information it files or furnishes with the SEC.\n\nWe function as a value-added distributor, specializing in plumbing and heating products and solutions. Our distribution channels include dedicated sales associates, showroom consultants, and e-commerce platforms. Primarily serving North America, our client base is predominantly within the Repair, Maintenance, and Installation (RMI) sector, as well as new residential construction. The Group's operations are divided into two key segments: the United States and Canada.\n\nThe United States segment accounted for 94%, 95%, and 93% of the total consolidated revenue from continuing operations in fiscal years 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. Operating under the Ferguson brand, this segment offers a wide array of plumbing and heating products and solutions, delivered through a network of distribution centers, branches, specialist sales associates, counter services, showroom consultants, and e-commerce platforms. It serves the residential, commercial, civil/infrastructure, and industrial markets on a national scale.\n\nThe residential market, representing 56%, 54%, and 52% of the total United States segment revenue in fiscal years 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively, caters to both new construction and RMI across single and multifamily homes. Sales are typically made to trade contractors, builders, and remodeling contractors, with our product portfolio including plumbing supplies, water heaters, pipe, valves, and fittings, kitchen and bathroom fixtures, appliances, HVAC units and supplies. Our services encompass consultation, advice, project management, online tools, and pick-up and delivery services.\n\nThe commercial market segment, contributing significantly to U.S. revenues (31%, 32%, and 33% in fiscal 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively), primarily serves new construction and renovation projects across diverse non-residential sectors like education, healthcare, government facilities, warehousing, data centers, lodging, and offices. This segment's offerings encompass plumbing parts and supplies, piping components, fire sprinkler systems, and associated hardware, complemented by services such as quotation assistance, on-site delivery, project management, and fabrication.\n\nThe civil/infrastructure market segment, accounting for 7% of total U.S. revenues in the past three fiscal years, caters to public and private water authorities, utility contractors, public works/line contractors, and heavy highway contractors. Its product portfolio includes piping components, water meters and automation systems, irrigation and drainage solutions, geosynthetics, and stormwater management products, alongside services such as digitally enhanced estimation, project management and design, on-site delivery, logistics, and advanced metering infrastructure.\n\nThe industrial market segment, representing 6%, 7%, and 8% of total U.S. revenues in fiscal 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively, focuses on new construction, repairs, and maintenance across sectors like chemical, energy, food and beverage, mining, and pulp and paper. This segment provides pipe, fittings, and flanges, general industrial maintenance repair and operations products, high-density polyethylene products, and fabrication services, along with supply chain services, equipment rental, and valves and automation services.\n\nAcross all our market sectors, we provide online access to products such as plumbing supplies, piping components, kitchen and bathroom fixtures, appliances, HVAC equipment, hangers, fasteners, and water heaters. In the United States, e-commerce accounted for 21% and 19% of total segment revenue in fiscal 2021 and 2020, respectively.\n\nOur U.S. operations, with 1,470 branches and approximately 28,000 associates as of July 31, 2021, serve all 50 states. These branches are supported by 10 distribution centers, offering same-day and next-day product availability, which we consider a key competitive advantage. Additionally, we are establishing market distribution centers (MDCs) in major metropolitan areas for efficient final-mile delivery, with our first MDC opened in Denver, Colorado, in late fiscal 2021.\n\nIn Canada, the segment contributed 6%, 5%, and 7% of total consolidated revenue from continuing operations in fiscal 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. This segment primarily serves trade customers in residential, commercial, and industrial sectors, operating 209 branches, one distribution center, and employing approximately 3,000 associates as of July 31, 2021. Operating under the Wolseley brand, it supplies plumbing, heating, ventilation, air conditioning, and refrigeration products, as well as specialist water and wastewater treatment products, and PVF solutions to various customer segments.\n\nWe are confident in our ability to attract new clients and generate appealing returns. Our dominant positions in the residential and commercial sectors, measured by revenue relative to overall market size, are testament to this. The markets we operate in are highly decentralized, with few major competitors and a larger number of mid-sized regional distributors, as well as numerous small and local ones. While organic growth is a viable path to expand our market share, acquisitions remain a pivotal part of our growth strategy. We aim to acquire businesses that can be integrated into our existing branch network and those that enhance our customer service capabilities. We foresee substantial growth and consolidation opportunities in these large, fragmented markets. Our customers often require a wide range of products and services, which we leverage our organizational scale and expertise to provide. Our extensive network of suppliers, associates, branches, and distribution centers gives us a competitive edge, as many of our rivals operate only locally. These factors contribute to our revenue and cash flow growth, ultimately benefiting our shareholders. Additionally, we reap significant synergies that help reduce operating costs and improve margins. Our decision to operate in these markets is driven by our belief in the potential for strong growth, robust gross and net margins, and attractive returns on capital. In essence, our role as a value-added distributor is to be a reliable supplier and partner to our customers, offering innovative products and solutions to enhance their projects. The COVID-19 pandemic has underscored the critical nature of our customers' reliance on us for delivering essential infrastructure across various sectors. As we look ahead, we remain committed to supporting our customers in keeping millions of homes and businesses operational, while helping them run their businesses more efficiently.\n\nClient Base, Contractual Ties, and Seasonality\nOur client portfolio is diverse, with no single customer holding significant sway. We are not beholden to any substantial licenses, industrial, commercial, or financial contracts, or novel manufacturing methods. Our operations are not heavily influenced by seasonal trends.\n\nIntellectual Property\nWe safeguard our proprietary assets and brand through a blend of intellectual property laws, confidentiality protocols, and contractual clauses. We have secured or applied for trademarks, service marks, copyrights, and internet domain names, both domestically and internationally.\n\nRaw Materials and Commodities\nWe procure, distribute, and sell products from both domestic and international suppliers, with over 34,000 vendors. In the U.S., over 95% of products sold are sourced locally. Our raw materials are generally accessible from multiple sources and not typically constrained in normal market conditions. Around 12% of U.S. revenues come from basic products with significant commodity-priced materials, primarily plastic, copper, and steel, which can experience volatile price fluctuations. Fuel price fluctuations can also indirectly impact transportation costs. Generally, price increases in these materials elevate our operating costs and reduce operating profits if these increases cannot be passed on to customers. Conversely, if we can maintain prices despite falling raw material costs, profitability may increase.\n\nRegulatory Environment\nOur operations are subject to various statutes, regulations, and standards in the countries and markets we serve, including the U.S. and Canada. The extent of regulation and penalties for non-compliance can vary. While not in a highly regulated industry, we are subject to general business laws, including those governing competition, product safety, timber sourcing, data protection, and labor practices.\n\nKey Business Areas\nThe company's operations span across various critical domains, including:\n- Accounting and tax standards, adhering to international norms\n- International trade, facilitating global business transactions\n- Fraud prevention and detection, maintaining ethical business practices\n- Anti-bribery and corruption measures, upholding integrity\n- Land use management, balancing development and conservation\n- Environmental sustainability, promoting eco-friendly practices\n- Health and safety protocols, ensuring a secure work environment\n- Transportation infrastructure, supporting efficient logistics\n- Payment terms and conditions, fair and transparent business dealings\n\nOrganizational Structure\nThe Group's structure is headed by the ultimate holding company, with a network of significant subsidiaries as of July 31, 2021, detailed below:\n\n| Company Name | Principal Activity | Country of Incorporation | Ownership Interest |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| Ferguson Enterprises, LLC(1) | Operating company | United States | 100% |\n| Ferguson Finance (Switzerland) AG | Financing company | Switzerland | 100% |\n| Ferguson Group Holdco Limited | Investment company | England and Wales | 100% |\n| Ferguson Holdings Limited | Holding company | Jersey | 100% |\n| Ferguson Holdings (Switzerland) AG | Investment company | Switzerland | 100% |\n| Ferguson Swiss Holdings Limited | Investment company | England and Wales | 100% |\n| Ferguson Overseas Limited | Investment company | England and Wales | 100% |\n| Ferguson UK Holdings Limited(2) | Investment company | England and Wales | 100% |\n| Ferguson U.S. Holdings, Inc.(3) | Investment company | United States | 100% |\n\n(1) Ownership held in membership interests.\n(2) Ownership held in ordinary shares and ordinary A shares.\n(3) Ownership held in common stock.\n\nUnless otherwise stated, the listed subsidiaries primarily consist of ordinary shares, held directly or indirectly by the parent company, with ownership interest proportional to voting rights.\n\nAs of July 31, 2021, our network comprised 1,679 branches, with 1,470 situated in the United States and 209 in Canada. Of these, approximately 18% of U.S. branches and 24% of Canadian branches were owned by us, with the rest being leased. The following tables detail our distribution centers in both countries as of the same date:\n\nUnited States:\n| Location | Square Feet | Leased/Owned |\n|---|---|---|\n| Fort Payne, AL | 643,000 | Owned |\n| Stockton, CA (land) | - | Leased |\n| Stockton, CA (building) | 648,200 | Owned |\n| Perris, CA | 1,039,898 | Owned |\n| Frostproof, FL | 521,122 | Owned |\n| Waterloo, IA | 608,800 | Owned |\n| Celina, OH | 676,320 | Owned |\n| Coxsackie, NY | 465,000 | Owned |\n| McGregor, TX | 542,000 | Owned |\n| Front Royal, VA | 753,880 | Leased |\n| Richland, WA | 643,477 | Owned |\n\nCanada:\n| Location | Square Feet | Leased/Owned |\n|---|---|---|\n| Milton, ON | 292,395 | Leased |\n\nItem 4A. Unresolved Staff Comments\nNot applicable.\n\nItem 5. Operating and Financial Review and Prospects\nManagement Overview\n\nThe subsequent analysis of our financial status and operational outcomes is designed to reflect management's viewpoint on our operational and financial performance, as per IFRS standards. This disclosure aims to aid readers in comprehending and interpreting the audited consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in this annual report. Please consider this section in conjunction with the aforementioned audited financial statements.\n\nThis discussion also incorporates trend data and forward-looking statements. Please note that actual results may vary significantly from those discussed, influenced by factors such as those outlined below and elsewhere in this annual report, particularly under \"Forward-Looking Statements\" and \"Item 3. Key Information—D. Risk Factors.\"\n\nSegments\n\nOn January 29, 2021, the Group divested its UK business, which is now presented as a discontinued operation in the Group's financial statements, in accordance with IFRS 5. For further details, refer to \"Item 4. Information on the Company—A. History and Development.\"\n\nPost the sale of the UK business, the Group operates two reportable segments as of July 31, 2021: the United States and Canada. These segments are based on distinct operating businesses, each overseen by a separate divisional management team responsible for their performance. These businesses are managed geographically and regularly reviewed by the Group Chief Executive and the Group Chief Financial Officer, who decide resource allocation and assess performance. All reportable segments generate revenue solely from the distribution of plumbing and heating products, with revenue attribution based on the location of the Group company reporting it.\n\nOperating Results\n\nKey Factors Influencing Operational Outcomes\n\nOur operational results have been impacted by, and are expected to continue being affected by, the following principal factors related to our business.\n\nThe fiscal year 2021 commenced as economies began to reopen following the COVID-19 pandemic lockdowns, which persisted until the spring and early summer of 2021. Our first half of the year demonstrated robust performance, with a marked acceleration in recovery from February onwards. However, this recovery presented unique challenges, including scarcity of products, disrupted supply chains, and escalating prices. Additionally, the broader macroeconomic landscape resulted in a tightening labor market and increased labor costs.\n\nThroughout the COVID-19 pandemic, our business management strategy has centered on three key priorities: safeguarding the health and well-being of our associates, continuing to serve our customers in their time of need, and ensuring the long-term strength of our business. In response to the COVID-19 operational environment, we bolstered our inventory levels to maintain product availability for our customers. We anticipate navigating through ongoing challenges related to supply chains, product availability, and other issues, while closely monitoring for potential business disruptions due to a resurgence of COVID-19 or other macroeconomic developments.\n\nThe uncertain global economic situation could also impact the Group's future tax rate. Government responses to the COVID-119 pandemic have created political and regulatory uncertainty, leading to changes in prevailing tax regimes and increased international cooperation on tax affairs. Following announcements of higher tax rates in the UK and proposed increases in the U.S. federal tax rate, along with international cooperation on global minimum taxation, there is a possibility that the Group's consolidated effective tax rate could temporarily increase.\n\nFor a detailed breakdown of the financial performance and market conditions within the Group's segments, please refer to the \"Segment Results of Operations for Fiscal 2021 and Fiscal 2020\" section.\n\nRegarding acquisitions and disposals, [insert relevant information].\n\nThe company has traditionally fostered growth through organic means and strategic acquisitions. In the fiscal years 2021, 2020, and 2019, it concluded 7, 6, and 15 acquisitions, respectively, investing $335 million, $351 million, and $657 million, including funds allocated for acquisitions in the preceding year. Additionally, the company divested several of its businesses, including the sale of its UK operations on January 29, 2021, to concentrate on its North American presence. The net cash proceeds from these disposals in 2021, 2020, and 2019 were $380 million, $7 million, and $201 million, respectively.\n\nFor a detailed breakdown of these acquisitions and disposals, refer to notes 25 and 26 in the company's audited consolidated financial statements.\n\nIn terms of operational results, the following analysis provides insights into the company's performance on a continuing operations basis for fiscal years 2021, 2020, and 2019. This discussion aims to help readers understand the company's financial statements, the year-over-year changes in key figures, and the primary factors driving these changes. It is important to note that the UK business, which was disposed of on January 29, 2021, has been reclassified as discontinued operations, and the prior year's results have been restated accordingly.\n\nLastly, for an in-depth discussion of new accounting standards and changes, please refer to note 1 in the company's audited consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe following table encapsulates our income statement for the specified periods and is intended to be examined in conjunction with, and is entirely subject to the qualifications of, the audited consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2021, which are included in this annual report.\n\n|  | Year ended July 31, 2021 | Year ended July 31, 2020 |\n|---|---|---|\n| Revenue | $22,792 million | $19,940 million |\n| Cost of sales | $(15,812) million | $(13,957) million |\n| Gross profit | $6,980 million | $5,983 million |\n| Operating costs | $(4,946) million | $(4,534) million |\n| Operating profit | $2,034 million | $1,449 million |\n| Finance costs | $(145) million | $(147) million |\n| Finance income | $1 million | $7 million |\n| Share of profit/(loss) after tax of associate | $1 million | $(2) million |\n| Gain on disposal of interests in associates and other investments | — | $7 million |\n| Impairment of interests in associates | — | $(22) million |\n| Profit before tax | $1,891 million | $1,292 million |\n| Tax | $(241) million | $(317) million |\n| Profit from continuing operations | $1,650 million | $975 million |\n| Loss from discontinued operations | $(142) million | $(14) million |\n| Profit for the year | $1,508 million | $961 million |\n\nIn fiscal 2021, the company's earnings reached $22.8 billion, marking a $2.9 billion or 14.3% increase from the previous year. This surge was primarily driven by a $2.6 billion boost from higher sales volume and price inflation. The robust growth in residential markets, acquisitions worth $290 million, and a $60 million gain from foreign currency translation contributed significantly to this increase. However, a $92 million impact due to one less trading day in 2021 partially offset these gains, with price inflation accounting for approximately 3% of the total.\n\nThe cost of sales in fiscal 2021 amounted to $15.8 billion, a $1.9 billion or 13.3% increase from the prior year, largely due to the increase in sales.\n\nGross profit for fiscal 2021 stood at $7.0 billion, a $1.0 billion or 16.7% increase from the previous year. This improvement was primarily due to effective management of price inflation, reflecting the strength and efficiency of the company's supply chain. Consequently, the gross profit margin rose by 60 basis points to 30.6%.\n\nOperating costs for fiscal 2021 totaled $4.9 billion, a $412 million or 9.1% increase from the prior year. This increase was primarily driven by higher sales volumes, leading to higher overall variable labor and other costs compared to fiscal 2020. Despite incurring higher variable costs, the company demonstrated strong operating cost leverage, with operating cost growth of 9.1% falling below revenue growth of 14.3%.\n\nFinance costs remained relatively stable at $145 million for fiscal 2021, comparable to the levels in fiscal 2020.\n\nIn fiscal 2021, no impairments were noted in relation to associates, marking a stark contrast to the $22 million recorded in the preceding year. The tax expense for fiscal 2021 stood at $241 million, a significant decrease of $76 million (24.0%) compared to fiscal 2020. The Company's effective tax rate for continuing operations was 12.7% in fiscal 2021, a substantial drop from the 24.5% recorded in the previous year. This decrease was primarily attributed to the release of provisions for uncertain tax positions following the conclusion of tax authority audits and the expiration of statute of limitations periods. However, this positive impact was partially offset by the tax effect of the increase in pre-tax earnings.\n\nThe profit from continuing operations for fiscal 2021 was a robust $1.7 billion, an impressive increase of $675 million (69.2%) compared to the prior year. This significant growth was primarily driven by revenue expansion and gross margin improvement, while also demonstrating improved operating cost leverage.\n\nIn fiscal 2021, losses from discontinued operations amounted to $142 million, largely due to the sale of the UK business during the first half of the fiscal year. For further details, please refer to note 6 in the consolidated financial statements.\n\nFor fiscal 2021 and 2020, the segment results of operations for the United States were as follows:\n- Revenue: $21.478 billion in 2021, up from $18.857 billion in 2020\n- Underlying trading profit: $2.073 billion in 2021, up from $1.587 billion in 2020\n\nIn fiscal 2021, the United States segment generated $21.5 billion in revenue, marking a $2.6 billion, or 13.9%, increase from the previous year. This growth can be attributed to a $2.4 billion boost stemming from both higher sales volume and price inflation, primarily driven by robust residential market growth compared to fiscal 2020. Additionally, revenue from acquisitions contributed an extra $290 million. However, these gains were partially mitigated by a $81 million impact due to one fewer trading day in 2021 compared to 2020. The overall impact of price inflation in fiscal 2021 was approximately 3%.\n\nThe following table details the revenue growth by end market for the United States segment in fiscal 2021:\n\n| End Market | % of United States Segment Revenue | United States Segment Revenue Growth (%) |\n|---|---|---|\n| Residential | ~56 | 19 |\n| Commercial | ~31 | 9 |\n| Civil/Infrastructure | ~7 | 15 |\n| Industrial | ~6 | (1) |\n| Total | 13.9 |  |\n\nIn the fiscal year 2021, the residential market segment witnessed a 19% surge in revenue compared to the previous year, fueled by an uptick in residential new housing starts, permits, and particularly, residential repair and maintenance (RMI) growth, especially during the second half of the fiscal year. This growth can be attributed to the increased activity of project-oriented consumers and light decorative professionals, driving e-commerce revenue. Within the non-residential markets, commercial and civil/infrastructure-related revenue grew by 9% and 15%, respectively, compared to fiscal 2020. This growth was primarily driven by increased project-related work during the second half of fiscal 2021, as more U.S. markets reopened following the COVID-19 pandemic's impacts in the prior year. Conversely, industrial revenue declined by 1% compared to fiscal 2020, primarily due to a more pronounced impact in the first half of fiscal 2021 of decreases in project-related work due to the COVID-19 pandemic, although this was partially offset by modest growth during the second half of the fiscal year.\n\nThe underlying trading profit for the United States segment in fiscal 2021 was $2.1 billion, marking a $486 million or 30.6% increase from the prior year. This significant increase was primarily driven by revenue growth in residential markets and overall gross margin expansion, while also demonstrating improved operating cost leverage.\n\nIn fiscal 2021, the Canadian segment generated revenues totaling $1.3 billion, marking a $231 million, or 21.3%, uptick from the previous year. This surge was primarily driven by a $182 million boost in sales volume and price inflation, largely attributed to robust residential market sales, and a $60 million foreign exchange translation effect. These gains were partially tempered by a $11 million loss due to one fewer trading day. The average price inflation rate for the fiscal year was approximately 4%.\n\nThe underlying trading profit for the Canadian segment in fiscal 2021 stood at $76 million, a $33 million, or 76.7%, increase from the prior year. This significant improvement was primarily due to revenue growth in residential markets and an overall expansion in gross margins, while maintaining operational cost efficiency.\n\nFor fiscal 2020, the United States segment reported revenues of $18.9 billion, a $499 million, or 2.7%, increase from the previous year. This growth was largely due to $355 million from acquisitions, $76 million from an additional trading day in fiscal 2020, and to a lesser extent, sales volume growth within the residential and civil/infrastructure end markets. The breakdown of revenue growth by end market is as follows: residential, approximately 54% of the United States segment revenue, grew by 5%.\n\nIn fiscal 2020, the company's revenue breakdown by market segment was as follows: residential (~32%), commercial (~7%), civil/infrastructure (~7%), and industrial (~7%), totaling 2.7%. Revenue growth was observed in the residential (+5%) and commercial (+1%) markets, primarily due to increased sales of core plumbing, HVAC, and own-brand products. The civil/infrastructure market grew by 9%, driven by increased sales of water management products and services, while the industrial market declined by 10% due to reduced sales across all major product categories.\n\nThe United States segment's underlying trading profit for fiscal 2020 was $1.6 billion, a 5.2% increase of $79 million from the previous year. This growth was primarily driven by sales volume increases in the residential and civil/infrastructure markets, with acquisitions and an additional trading day in fiscal 2020 contributing to the remainder of the growth.\n\nFor the Canada segment, revenue decreased by $288 million, or 21.0%, to $1.1 billion in fiscal 2020 compared to the prior year. This decline was primarily attributed to lower sales volume of $123 million due to reduced residential sales, in part due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The disposal of Wasco, a Dutch plumbing and heating business, also reduced revenue by $175 million, with the remainder of the decrease resulting from foreign currency translation.\n\nIn fiscal 2020, the Canada segment's underlying trading profit plummeted to $43 million, a stark $33 million drop (43.4%) from the preceding year, primarily due to sales volume decline, exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n\nThe Group's operations hinge on consistent access to funding to fulfill its operational obligations, support organic growth, and facilitate acquisitions. Its funding sources encompass operational cash flows and borrowings from financial institutions. As of July 31, 2021, the Company's borrowings (excluding bank overdrafts) stood at $2.5 billion, with $3.4 billion in available liquidity, comprising $1.2 billion in readily available cash and $2.2 billion in undrawn facilities. The Group projects it will meet its debt obligations as they fall due.\n\nIn terms of capital resources, the Group aims to strike a balance between funding certainty and a flexible, cost-effective borrowing structure. It maintains a policy of ensuring sufficient borrowing headroom to finance all planned investments and anticipated bolt-on acquisitions for the following financial year, with an additional safety margin. As of July 31, 2021 and 2020, the Group's total borrowings comprised:\n\nThis section provides an overview of key terms from several debt agreements that were unused as of July 31, 2021. Please note that this summary is not exhaustive and is subject to the full terms of the governing documents.\n\nMulticurrency Revolving Credit Facility\nThis facility, established under the Multicurrency Revolving Credit Facility Agreement dated March 10, 2020, involves the Company, Ferguson UK Holdings Limited (formerly Wolseley Limited), lenders, arrangers, and an agent. It offers an unsecured, multicurrency revolving loan of up to $1.1 billion, set to expire in March 2026. The Company and Ferguson UK Holdings Limited can request a one-year extension to the maturity date on the first and second anniversaries of the facility's signing. Interest rates are tied to LIBOR (or CDOR for Canadian dollars) plus a margin based on the Company's credit ratings. Quarterly commitment and utilization fees may apply.\n\nUnder the Multicurrency Revolving Credit Facility, borrowers enjoy the flexibility to prepay and redraw funds at their discretion, either partially or entirely, at any given time. The Company and Ferguson UK Holdings Limited (formerly Wolseley Limited) stand as unconditional guarantors for all obligations under this facility, except when they are the borrowers themselves. In specific scenarios, the facility mandates the prepayment of drawn amounts by the borrowers. The facility also incorporates standard affirmative and negative covenants, which, subject to certain exceptions, limit the Company and its subsidiaries' ability to incur debts, create liens, sell assets, or engage in acquisitions, mergers, or consolidations. Events of default and cross-default provisions are also outlined in the facility. As of July 31, 2021, no outstanding borrowings existed under this facility.\n\nIn March 2020, the Company and Ferguson UK Holdings Limited (formerly Wolseley Limited) initiated a $500 million bilateral loan agreement with Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation (SMBC), set to expire in March 2022. This agreement, akin to the Multicurrency Revolving Credit Facility, allows the Company to request a one-year extension at SMBC's discretion. As of July 31, 2021, no outstanding borrowings were recorded under this agreement.\n\nThe Trade Receivables Securitization Facility operates under two key agreements: (i) a Receivables Purchase Agreement, initiated on July 31, 2013, and subsequently amended, supplemented, and restated, involving Ferguson Enterprises, LLC as the servicer, Ferguson Receivables, LLC (a bankruptcy-remote, special purpose entity wholly owned by Ferguson) as the seller, lenders as conduit and committed purchasers, letters of credit banks, facility agents, and the administrative agent; and (ii) a Purchase and Contribution Agreement, also dated July 31, 2013, and similarly amended, involving Ferguson Enterprises and its subsidiaries as originators and Ferguson Receivables as the purchaser.\n\nThis facility, with a funding capacity of up to $600 million and a termination date of May 2024, includes an accordion feature that, subject to lender approval, allows the commitment to be increased to $800 million. It facilitates the purchase of undivided ownership interests in a revolving pool of certain trade receivables and related securities generated by the originators, which are then transferred to the seller and securitized against lending advances made by the conduit and committed purchasers. At all times, borrowings under this facility are recorded on the Group's balance sheet.\n\nFees under this facility are calculated at a rate equal to the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) or the commercial paper rates of the conduit purchasers, plus an applicable margin. The Company also pays customary fees for unused amounts to maintain the availability of the facility.\n\nThe Trade Receivables Securitization Facility incorporates standard positive covenants, along with standard negative covenants that, subject to specific exceptions, limit the Company and its subsidiaries involved from accruing debt, granting additional liens on receivables, and selling assets or engaging in acquisitions, mergers, or consolidations. This facility also includes customary default and cross-default provisions.\n\nMoreover, the facility mandates that the Company's performance in relation to trade receivables remains at prescribed levels, specifically concerning timely debt collections from customers and the amount of debt written off as uncollectible. It also necessitates the generation and availability of a certain level of trade receivables to support the borrowings under the arrangement. As of July 31, 2021, no borrowings were outstanding under the Trade Receivables Securitization Facility.\n\nIn a separate context, the Private Placement Notes were issued through a private placement, a method of selling securities to a select group of investors, rather than on a stock exchange.\n\nIn the month of November 2017, Wolseley Capital, Inc., under the moniker \"Wolseley Capital,\" facilitated a private placement of securities amounting to $450 million in aggregate principal. This transaction involved the issuance of private placement notes, which were guaranteed by the company itself, as per a note and guarantee agreement dated November 30, 2017. The 2017 Private Placement Notes comprised several series, including:\n\n- $55 million of 3.30% Series L Guaranteed Senior Notes, due on November 30, 2023\n- $150 million of 3.44% Series M Guaranteed Senior Notes, due on November 30, 2024\n- $150 million of 3.51% Series N Guaranteed Senior Notes, due on November 30, 2026\n\nAdditionally, there were $95 million of Floating Rate Series O Guaranteed Senior Notes, also due on November 30, 2023. In a subsequent development, in June 2021, Wolseley Capital Inc. redeemed the Floating Rate 2017 Private Placement Notes at their face value, ahead of their original maturity date of November 30, 2023.\n\nIn June 2015, Wolseley Capital facilitated a private placement of notes totaling $800 million, with the company acting as guarantor. This transaction, finalized on June 25, 2015, comprised three distinct series of notes:\n\n- $250 million in 3.43% Series I Guaranteed Senior Notes, maturing on September 1, 2022,\n- $400 million in 3.73% Series J Guaranteed Senior Notes, maturing on September 1, 2025,\n- $150 million in 3.83% Series K Guaranteed Senior Notes, maturing on September 1, 2027.\n\nIn November 2005, Wolseley Capital conducted another private placement, this time amounting to $281 million in 5.32% Series F Guaranteed Senior Notes. These notes, guaranteed by the company and dated November 16, 2005, matured on November 16, 2020.\n\nThe interest payment schedules for these notes varied:\n\n- The 2017 Fixed Rate Private Placement Notes accrued interest semi-annually on May 30 and November 30,\n- The 2017 Floating Rate Private Placement Notes accrued interest quarterly on February 28, May 30, August 30, and November 30,\n- The 2015 Private Placement Notes accrued interest semi-annually on March 1 and September 1,\n- The 2005 Private Placement Notes accrued interest semi-annually on May 15 and November 15.\n\nWolseley Capital's commitments under the note and guarantee agreements are fully and unconditionally backed by the Company and Ferguson UK Holdings Limited. Wolseley Capital retains the option to redeem the Private Placement Notes, in whole or in part, at any juncture, at a price equivalent to 100% of the principal amount being prepaid, along with a \"make-whole\" prepayment premium. Furthermore, Wolseley Capital is obligated to consult with noteholders in the event of a change of control and any subsequent proposed alterations to the terms of the outstanding Private Placement Notes. If no consensus is reached, Wolseley Capital must offer to repurchase the notes at a price equal to 100% of their principal amount plus accrued interest.\n\nThe note purchase agreements incorporate standard affirmative and negative covenants. Among other provisions, these covenants restrict, with certain exceptions, the Company's non-guarantor subsidiaries' capacity to incur debt and the Group's ability to engage in affiliate transactions, grant liens on its assets, sell assets, or undertake acquisitions, mergers, or consolidations. Additionally, subject to certain exceptions, the note purchase agreements mandate the maintenance of a specified leverage ratio.\n\nThe outstanding Private Placement Notes carry standard events of default. Upon such an event and the acceleration of the Private Placement Notes, the Company is required to repay the outstanding Private Placement Notes, along with a make-whole premium and accrued and unpaid interest.\n\nIn the month of October 2018, Ferguson Finance plc, hereafter referred to as \"Ferguson Finance\", issued $750 million in bonds, known as the \"2018 4.5% Notes\", which mature on October 24, 2028. These notes were fully and unconditionally guaranteed by both the Company and Ferguson UK Holdings Limited (formerly known as Wolseley Limited), on a senior, unsubordinated, and unsecured basis. The interest on these notes, at a rate of 4.5%, is payable semi-annually, on April 24 and October 24, until their maturity. Ferguson Finance retains the option to redeem these notes, in whole or in part, under certain conditions. Firstly, it can do so at 100% of the principal amount, plus a \"make-whole\" prepayment premium, at any time before three months preceding the October 24, 2028 maturity date. Secondly, in the event of a default and failure to cure it or secure a waiver, Ferguson Finance must repay the notes plus any accrued and unpaid interest.\n\nIn June 2020, Ferguson Finance issued $600 million in bonds, known as the \"2020 3.25% Notes,\" which mature in 2030. These bonds, along with the \"2018 4.5% Notes,\" are collectively referred to as \"144A Bonds.\" They are fully guaranteed by the Company and Ferguson UK Holdings Limited (formerly Wolseley Limited). Interest on these notes is paid semi-annually on June 2 and December 2, until they mature on June 2, 2030. Ferguson Finance has the option to redeem these notes, either at 100% of their principal amount plus a \"make-whole\" prepayment premium at any time before three months of the maturity date, or upon default and failure to cure it, by repaying the notes plus any accrued and unpaid interest.\n\nAs of July 31, 2021, the Group's borrowings were categorized as follows:\n- Current: Bank overdrafts totaling $183 million.\n- Non-current: Senior unsecured loan notes amounting to $2,528 million.\n- Total borrowings: $2,711 million.\n\nAs of July 31, 2021, the aggregate of bank overdrafts amounted to $183 million, with $36 million being part of the Group's cash pooling arrangements, which are offset by an equal and opposite balance within cash and cash equivalents. These figures are subject to a master netting agreement.\n\nThe non-current loan balance of $2.5 billion, as of the same date, includes a fair value adjustment of $23 million. For more details, please refer to note 19 in the consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe non-current loans, as of July 31, 2021, are scheduled for repayment as follows:\n- Due in one to two years: $250 million\n- Due in two to three years: $55 million\n- Due in three to four years: $150 million\n- Due in four to five years: $400 million\n- Due in over five years: $1,673 million\n\nThe Group's policies on accounting for, valuing, and managing the risk of financial instruments have not undergone any significant changes during the year.\n\nCapital expenditure, which supports the Group's strategy of investing in business model development, totaled $581 million, $653 million, and $1.1 billion in fiscal years 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. These investments were primarily allocated to acquisitions and strategic projects, such as new distribution centers, distribution hubs, technology, processes, and network infrastructure.\n\nYear Ended July 31,\n2021 2020 2019\nCapital Expenditure\n$ million\nAcquisition of businesses (net of cash acquired) 335 351 657\nPurchases of property, plant and equipment 174\n\nFinancial Statements:\n- Intangible Assets & Contractual Obligations: The Group's intangible asset purchases amounted to $215 million and $382 million in 2021 and 2020, respectively. Contractual obligations totaled $72 million and $87 million in the same years. Additionally, $36 million was recorded as 'Total' for these categories.\n- Cash Outflows: The Group's anticipated cash outflows, excluding interest income and derivatives, for trade and other payables, and bank borrowings, were $1,075 million and $653 million at the beginning and end of 2021, respectively.\n\nCash & Cash Equivalents:\n- Year-End Balances: The Group's cash, cash equivalents, and bank overdrafts at the start and end of 2021 were $1,867 million and $1,152 million, and $1,086 million and $1,867 million, respectively.\n\nCash Flows from Operating Activities:\n- Fiscal 2021 vs. 2020: Net cash generated from operating activities decreased by $327 million (17.5%) in 2021 compared to 2020, primarily due to increased investment in working capital, particularly inventory, to maintain product availability during industry supply chain disruptions. This decrease was partially offset by a $1.0 billion increase in trade payables.\n- Fiscal 2020 vs. 2019: Net cash generated from operating activities increased by $578 million (44.8%) in 2020 compared to 2019, primarily due to changes in rental cost presentation under IFRS 16, which increased cash generated from operating activities by $348 million.\n\nIn fiscal 2021, the company's net cash outflow from investing activities significantly decreased by 71.6% to $172 million, down from $606 million in the previous year. This substantial reduction was primarily attributed to two key factors: the company realized $373 million in cash from the disposal of its UK business, and it also reduced its spending on purchases of property, plant, and equipment by $41 million due to the timing of projects. This resulted in a total decrease of $434 million in cash outflow from investing activities compared to fiscal 2020.\n\nLooking back further, the company's net cash outflow from investing activities had previously decreased by 22.6% to $606 million in fiscal 2020, down from $783 million in fiscal 2019. This decrease was primarily driven by fewer acquisitions, a reduction in cash used of $306 million, and a decrease in spending on purchases of property, plant, and equipment, amounting to a reduction in cash used of $167 million. These factors fully offset a reduction in cash generated from the disposals of businesses of $194 million.\n\nShifting focus to financing activities, the company's net cash outflow increased significantly to $2.1 billion in fiscal 2021, up from $485 million in fiscal 2020, marking a $1.6 billion increase. This increase was primarily driven by higher dividends paid in fiscal 2021, which included a catch-up payment following the suspension of interim dividends in fiscal 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as a special dividend paid in connection with the sale of the UK business. Additionally, the company had $1.2 billion in lower net proceeds from borrowings in 2021, and it also conducted $400 million in share repurchases.\n\nIn fiscal 2020, the company's cash flow from financing activities shifted from a net inflow of $131 million in 2019 to a net outflow of $485 million, a change of $616 million. This was predominantly due to a $301 million increase in Treasury share purchases and a $295 million adjustment in lease liability capital payments, stemming from the implementation of IFRS 16. In September 2021, the company's board approved a $1 billion share repurchase program, aiming to complete it within a year.\n\nAs for fund transfers, there are no legal or economic restrictions preventing subsidiaries from remitting cash to the parent company via dividends, loans, or advances. This applies to agreements governing the Multicurrency Revolving Credit Facility, Trade Receivables Securitization Arrangements, outstanding Private Placement Notes, Bilateral Loan, 2018 4.5% Notes, and 2020 3.25% Notes.\n\nThe Group's financial risk management policies, consistently applied over the past three fiscal years, address foreign currency risk, interest rate risk, liquidity risk, and counterparty exposures. These risks arise from the Group's international operations and the financial instruments funding them. The Group's operating businesses manage trade credit and commodity price exposures, which have remained unchanged since the previous year. For detailed information on key policies, please refer to note 20 in the audited consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe entity maintains short-term cash deposits with financial institutions and engages in agreements like interest rate swaps, which promise future cash inflows from these institutions. These transactions expose the entity to credit risk, with a maximum potential exposure of $1.2 billion. This risk is mitigated by establishing credit and settlement limits for approved counterparties, which are approved by the treasury committee and regularly reviewed.\n\nIn applying the entity's accounting policies, certain transactions and balances are valued using estimates or assumptions. If these prove inaccurate, they could impact the following year's financial statements. However, management believes that the applied estimates and assumptions pose no significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the next fiscal year.\n\nManagement has carefully considered the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the financial statements. They assessed relevant areas, such as expected credit losses, inventory impairment, goodwill, and asset impairment, as well as deferred tax asset recognition. They concluded that there was no material negative impact in these areas and no new sources of estimation uncertainty.\n\nThe entity's most significant accounting policies, including revenue recognition and inventories, are detailed in note 1 to the audited consolidated financial statements. Some of these policies require complex, subjective, or difficult judgments and estimates. The most critical accounting estimates include:\n\n- Leases: determining whether extension and termination options are likely to be exercised.\n- Pensions and other post-retirement benefits: selecting the bonds to include when determining the discount rate.\n\nResearch and Development, Patents, and Licenses are not applicable in this context.\n\nFor trend information, refer to \"A.

{"text": "If you seek Jessica Biel's authentic contact details, including her phone number, email address, and fanmail information, you've come to the right place. We are pleased to provide you with Jessica Biel's contact information, including her phone number, email address, and fanmail details.\n\nJessica Biel, a prominent American model and actress, began her career in the modeling industry at a young age and continues to flourish today. After securing a scholarship at a conference, she honed her acting skills at the prestigious Young Actor's Space in New York City. Biel first gained public recognition for her role as Mary Camden in the WB series '7th Heaven.' While this role brought her significant fame, she felt that the wholesome image of Mary Camden might limit her acting versatility. To challenge this perception, Biel posed semi-nude for the cover of 'Gear' magazine, a decision that sparked controversy among her fans.\n\nFollowing her departure from '7th Heaven' after its sixth season, Biel's portrayal of Casey Jackson in 'Ulee's Gold' earned her critical acclaim and an Independent Spirit Award nomination for Best Debut Performance. Her exceptional talent was further showcased in the comedy 'Summer Catch' and, despite mixed reviews, her performance in 'The Rules of Attraction' demonstrated her range as an actress. Biel's role in the horror film 'The Texas Chain Saw Massacre' brought her to the attention of a wider audience, and her subsequent appearances in thrillers like 'The Sinner' and 'Cruel' have solidified her status as a serious and versatile performer.\n\nJessica Biel's parents, Jonathan Biel, an entrepreneur and business consultant, and Kimberley Biel, a spiritual healer and homemaker, welcomed her into the world in Ely, Minnesota. Growing up, Jessica had a younger sibling who resided with her, and the family traversed six different U.S. states during her youth. Her introduction to the performing arts began at a young age, with dance lessons and concurrent voice coaching.\n\nIn 1994, Biel secured representation with a Denver talent agency and embarked on a modeling career, concurrently participating in the International Modeling & Talent Association conference. Her involvement led to a scholarship at the Young Actor's Space in Los Angeles, where she immersed herself in acting courses for three years, graduating with honors while balancing school academics and auditions.\n\nIn 1996, Biel landed the role of Mary Camden in the WB family drama series '7th Heaven,' which achieved both critical and commercial success. The following year, she co-starred with Jonathan Taylor Thomas in the comedy film 'I'll Be Home for Christmas,' and her image graced the cover of 'People' magazine's '50 Most Beautiful People' issue in 1999. However, her half-clad photograph on the cover of 'Gear' magazine in 2000 sparked considerable controversy.\n\nBiel graduated from Tufts University in Massachusetts in 2000, concurrently appearing in the television series '7th Heaven.' After the show's sixth season, she decided to depart from the role.\n\nFollowing the completion of her initial collegiate year, Biel elected to focus on her burgeoning acting career, subsequently relocating to Los Angeles with aspirations of securing roles in feature films. Born on March 3, 1982, in Ely, Minnesota, Biel, now 39, holds American citizenship and is a Pisces. As an accomplished actress, model, producer, and singer, Biel's professional prowess is complemented by her contact information, +1-(310) 477-4442.\n\nHer cinematic journey commenced with a 2001 comedy, 'Summer Catch,' wherein she co-starred alongside Freddie Prinze Jr. The subsequent year saw her portrayal of the outspoken Lara Halleran in 'The Rules of Attraction,' although the film's box office performance fell short of expectations. Biel's directorial debut came in 2003 with 'The Texas Chainsaw Massacre,' in which she played Erin, a role that proved financially successful.\n\nIn 2004, Biel's notable performance in 'Cellular' alongside Chris Evans garnered critical acclaim. Her 2005 filmography includes 'Stealth,' where she starred as a fighter pilot alongside Jamie Foxx and Josh Lucas, and 'London,' her second collaboration with Chris Evans. That same year, her role as a young office worker in 'Elizabethtown' opposite Orlando Bloom solidified her status as a leading lady in Hollywood.\n\nBiel's portrayal of a discharged soldier grappling with single motherhood in 'Home of the Brave' further exemplifies her versatility as an actress.\n\nIn the subsequent year, Biel made an appearance in the comedic film 'I Now Pronounce You Chuck and Larry', where she shared the spotlight with Nicolas Cage. This was not their first collaboration, having previously co-starred in 'Next'. The film was met with overwhelming audience approval.\n\nOne of Biel's most notable appearances was on an episode of 'Saturday Night Live', where she embodied the character of Jessica Rabbit, a cartoon figure. In 2009, she delivered a standout performance as Larita, an American woman married to a British man, in the film 'Easy Virtue'. Critics lauded her performance in this role.\n\nBiel portrayed a publicist in the 2010 film 'Valentine's Day', exploring her relationship with a reporter. That same year, she took on the role of an army captain in 'The A-Team', earning an Academy Award nomination for her portrayal.\n\nIn 2011, Biel played a young woman in the romantic comedy 'New Year's Eve', a departure from her usual roles.

Recognized as one of the Best Places to Raise a Family by Wiley Publishing in 2007, Carnot-Moon has a population of 11,372, as per the 2010 United States Census. The town has witnessed growth, with the number of housing units available trending upward since the 1970s.\n\nCarnot-Moon's expansion is partly due to its strategic location as a transportation hub. Parkway West serves as a commuter route to Pittsburgh, while Interstates 376 and 79 channel further traffic through the area. The proximity of Pittsburgh International Airport, established in 1951, also contributes to this growth. Although the relocation of the landside terminal to Findlay Township in 1991 initially posed a threat to development, the community adapted by transforming into the airport's cargo port site.\n\nResiding in Carnot-Moon, Pennsylvania, one encounters three distinct neighborhoods, each with its unique character. The University Boulevard corridor is dominated by Robert Morris University, bringing a vibrant college atmosphere. For those who enjoy an active outdoor lifestyle, Coraopolis Heights to the south is an attractive option, with easy access to Robin Hill Park and the recently refurbished Moon Park to the west. The central West Hills neighborhood serves as the community's commercial and retail hub, housing many of its best dining and shopping options.\n\nThe ease of finding a residence in Carnot-Moon largely depends on the chosen neighborhood. The University Boulevard area predominantly features rental apartments, while the other parts of town offer more single-family homes. Fortunately, the town maintains a low vacancy rate of around 10 percent, ensuring a steady supply of available homes and apartments.\n\nThe availability of rentals inclusive of all utility bills can be scarce, depending on one's specific requirements. Each rental scenario, naturally, presents its unique circumstances. When seeking apartments for lease in Carnot-Moon, it is advisable to carry a record of your rental history, the most recent two bank statements or pay stubs, your checkbook to cover the initial and final month's rent, and any other relevant documents necessary for finalizing a lease agreement. A criminal background check and an up-to-date credit history can also be beneficial, demonstrating to potential landlords your serious intent.\n\nIn terms of crime statistics, Carnot-Moon's overall crime rate is lower than the national average. Specifically, the incidence of violent crime in the area is notably low when compared to the national violent crime rate. While property crime in Carnot-Moon is also below average, it is slightly higher than the violent crime rate in the area.", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "5824d384-0265-4eab-bbfa-72da4bc1e174", "url": "https://www.apartmentlist.com/pa/carnot-moon"}

{"text": "While the personal connections between models and their audience may not always be cultivated, the viewing experience on these platforms is undeniably engaging. If your priority is to ensure that the majority of your funds go directly to the models, then Cherry.tv is an excellent choice. We have meticulously evaluated various cam sites to determine their strengths and advantages, ensuring that by following our guidance, you will enjoy an optimal cam experience. The standard rate for a private show is 24 tokens per minute, with a ceiling of 120 tokens per minute for popular models.\n\nThe platforms offer round-the-clock access to shows, setting them apart. Notably, models can earn commissions of up to 60% and up to 25% from new customer referrals. Robust security measures, including privacy protection, are in place to safeguard sensitive user data. Moreover, these sites do not mandate the use of one's real name, providing an additional layer of anonymity for users. Viewers can enjoy free shows and even add models they find intriguing to their favorites list.\n\nModels have the flexibility to sell individual photo sets, videos, or content packages at prices they determine. Indeed, a top adult performer may provide a more satisfying experience than even the most advanced VR porn technology. Given these factors, it is worth considering signing up for these 'free to use' cam sites. Our advice is to create an account, participate in group classes, and explore the platforms firsthand to make an informed decision.\n\nIn contrast to conventional pornographic films, adult webcam services have the potential to significantly enhance and fulfill one's sexual fantasies and desires. Webcam models, unbound by genre constraints, can cater to individual preferences at any time and on demand. However, it is crucial to respect the models' boundaries, as excessive requests may result in refusal. With numerous models available across various platforms, locating a high-quality match can be likened to finding a gem amidst a vast array of options. Opting for a site with fewer models, but of higher quality and enthusiasm, may yield more satisfying results.\n\nWhile there are no strict limitations, showing generosity can lead to a better experience and reputation. Adult webcam sites also offer privacy features, such as blocking viewers from specific regions, to help maintain discretion. However, the pricing structure on platforms like Camsoda can be complex, with many popular sites clearly stating tipping requirements before entering private shows.\n\nEngaging in a private cam session with LivePrivate's models promises an unforgettable experience. As part of the LiveJasmin family, LivePrivates offers a premium camming experience, devoid of the chaotic chat rooms often found on free sites. LiveJasmin's reputation as the world's top adult webcam site is well-earned. One-on-one sessions with these skilled models are available, albeit at a high cost. While some viewers may overlook minor details, many appreciate the comprehensive aspects of live performances. The adult webcam industry has witnessed significant growth in both new models and viewers over recent years.\n\nTeenieCamGirls, a unique platform for sultry cam shows, invites you to indulge in an unparalleled experience. While men and couples typically earn around half of what women and trans performers do, with earnings potentially reaching over $30 per hour, the disparity can be attributed to biological factors such as refractory periods. Trans performers, predominantly male-to-female, follow closely in earnings. The site caters to a diverse audience, including everyday individuals seeking authentic connections.\n\nFor budget-conscious users, Cams Com stands out as a premier destination for exclusive shows. Unlike many US and European adult webcam sites that claim to be free but harbor hidden costs, this platform offers genuine free shows. MyFreeCams, for instance, provides free shows, but they are often concealed behind a paywall.\n\nThe site offers a variety of shows, including Private, Spy, Group, and 'True Private', each with its own token-based pricing structure. Moreover, models can integrate their accounts with interactive sex toys, allowing users to control toy vibrations through tips. As a relatively new site, its economy is still evolving, making it a smart choice for users. While Stripchat is a growing platform, it offers some of the most explicit live content for free, second only to Chaturbate.\n\nIn 2022, the 18 best cam girl sites for both viewers and models include TeenieCamGirls, Cams Com, and Stripchat, each offering unique features and experiences.\n\nLuckyCrush, a contemporary Cam2Cam adult webcam platform, randomly pairs users with captivating women, drawing in tens of millions of monthly visitors. Comparisons have been drawn between LuckyCrush and a hybrid of traditional cam sites and random chat services like Chatroulette, presenting a modern take on the latter's original concept. For those unfamiliar with cam sites, LuckyCrush serves as an ideal introduction.\n\nFor those seeking mainstream porn stars, Camsoda is the recommended platform. The site's interface allows users to filter women based on various parameters, such as video quality, audio, and mobile compatibility, with 'Best Match' updates upon filter selection. Alternatively, users can manually browse sex cams, organized by popularity, to discover high-quality live models broadcasting from their personal spaces.\n\nTrannyCam, an alternative adult webcam site, caters to users with unique preferences, offering live performances by individuals who may not conform to traditional gender norms.\n\nIn the event of a paid session where the woman is absent, it is essential to understand that the experience, while intimate, is not actual physical intercourse. However, it may serve as a viable alternative. For a comprehensive understanding of the adult cam site Cam Soda, a review is recommended to explore its offerings for an immersive online XXX experience.\n\nFor those considering a career as a camgirl on Chaturbate without compromising nudity, it is possible, albeit with potential challenges in earnings. A former camgirl with nearly a decade of experience advises starting on a private cam site, as the workload is generally less intense compared to token-based sites, making it an ideal starting point for 2020.\n\nUnlike numerous adult webcam platforms, Stripchat offers a plethora of explicit live content, much of it accessible at no cost. Graphic displays, including BDSM scenes, are prevalent and operate round the clock, outside of private shows. With thousands of live cam sites available, we present Stripchat as a notable option to explore one's preferences. The listed evaluations are independent and do not guarantee inclusion in future 'best cam sites' rankings. It is prudent to remember that some performers may exploit unsuspecting viewers, especially in the absence of real-life interaction. In the realm of adult entertainment, there exists a diverse audience appreciative of various body types. Success often hinges on personality, self-presentation, use of technology, and the ability to engage viewers. A couple with average bodies can indeed earn well, as exemplified by a Chaturbate broadcaster who, after six months, attracts 4000 viewers nightly and generates a three-figure income in just a few hours. Stripchat, currently in its beta phase, features cis-women and trans-women performers. However, the platform aims to expand its inclusivity in future updates. While tipping is not mandatory to watch shows, it is a common practice.\n\nEstablished two decades ago, this platform pioneered the adult cam site industry. ImLive, a trailblazer in this realm, specializes in live streaming videos featuring solo models or couples engaged in real-time performances. Its enduring appeal lies in the exceptional shows put on by performers for their viewers. The platform's diversity is evident in its live streaming feeds, offering a plethora of shows and models available at all hours. ImLive's relationship with Camster has been somewhat unique.", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "2921d2b8-0b81-4b58-9f47-8c930bb673bb", "url": "https://madeiraflyers.com/2022/10/11/best-cam-sites-right-now-updated-every-day-2/"}

The ice cream's consistency was unusually soft, leading to rapid melting. Despite its compact size, which should have facilitated easy maintenance, the facility was less than pristine. The most unsettling aspect, however, was observing a female employee handling food with extremely long artificial fingernails, a practice known to harbor bacteria underneath. This is a preventable issue that could have been easily addressed.\n\nConsidering a visit to Top of the Rock? Why not venture downstairs to the Rockefeller Center branch of Ben and Jerry's for a delightful ice cream experience? This popular outlet boasts an extensive selection of classic and innovative flavors, with fan favorites including Cherry Garcia and Chunky Monkey. On multiple occasions, I've found the flavor I craved, such as their light and creamy new yogurt ice cream. The atmosphere is inviting, and the staff consistently demonstrates a friendly and welcoming demeanor, a testament to the brand's commitment to customer satisfaction. The walls adorned with cow paintings serve as a playful reminder of Ben and Jerry's dedication to using high-quality ingredients. When you find yourself at Rockefeller Center, indulge in a cone or cup of Ben and Jerry's ice cream; it's sure to elevate your day. As for recommendations, Nana and Epiphanie were exceptional in their knowledge and suggestions. One customer praised the chocolate almond blueberry flavor, while another enjoyed the smooth and fruity 'rainbow' variety. Despite its name, the'small' size is reportedly quite generous.

The store's convenient location and swift, friendly service make it a popular choice, though its size may limit seating options, with all orders being take-out. While the variety of flavors is extensive, some customers may find their preferred choices unavailable. Hours of operation extend late into the night, providing a sweet treat for those with a late-night craving. However, customer service may vary, with some patrons reporting unsatisfactory experiences.

The cost of the ice cream was high, yet its taste was deemed delightful. However, the service was marred by racial insensitivity and unkindness, leaving the reviewer astonished by the poor treatment. Another customer praised the ice cream's quality, while a third lauded its mythical size and taste. A satisfied patron heaped accolades on the generous portions, wonderful cone, and complementary ingredients, awarding it more than five stars. Conversely, a disappointed customer enjoyed the original flavor but found the waitress lacking in enthusiasm and helpfulness. A cookie dough enthusiast declared it the best, with the cone receiving equal praise. A chocolate cake brownie purchaser raved about its rich, non-greasy, and non-stickiness-inducing taste. Some customers found the price-performance ratio acceptable, while others deemed it outrageously expensive, with a small ice cream costing over 7 USD. A personal preference review found the ice cream to have synthetic flavors.", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "c25f024d-0bc8-41c3-aa10-04f7d1469580", "url": "https://usa-stores.worldorgs.com/catalog/new-york/candy-store/ben-jerrys"}

{"text": "LuckyDino Casino's Inviting Welcome Bonus\nFeeling fortunate? LuckyDino's welcome bonus is designed to acquaint you with the casino's offerings, led by its amicable dinosaur mascot. This bonus serves as a gateway to the site's top games and demonstrates how to capitalize on complimentary funds by simply initiating your first deposit.\n\nThe LuckyDino welcome bonus is set to propel your casino journey, guiding you through the site's diverse gaming portfolio. While an initial deposit is required, the potential rewards far outweigh the initial investment. Transforming a modest deposit into substantial winnings is a distinct possibility – an opportunity not to be missed!\n\nNevertheless, as with any casino bonus, LuckyDino's welcome bonus presents both advantages and drawbacks. To assist your decision-making, we've compiled a comprehensive overview of the LuckyDino casino welcome bonus.\n\nWhere to Allocate the LuckyDino Welcome Bonus\nThe welcome bonus funds at LuckyDino can be utilized on most slot games, excluding those specified in the article's Terms and Conditions. Free spins are allocated as follows:\n- 50 Free Spins on the first deposit for 'Book of Dead'\n- 50 Free Spins on the second deposit for 'Legacy of Dead'\nAll free spins obtained through this offer are wager-free, meaning only the bonus cash carries wagering requirements.\n\nSecuring the LuckyDino Welcome Bonus\nObtaining the LuckyDino welcome bonus is a straightforward process. Upon making your initial deposit, the bonus funds will be credited to your account. However, opening a new account at LuckyDino also makes you eligible for additional perks. Here's a step-by-step guide:\n1. Establish a new account at LuckyDino\n2. Verify your account\n3. Make your first deposit\n4. Receive the first deposit bonus\n5. Fulfill the bonus's terms and conditions\n6. Repeat the process with the second offer!\n\nThe LuckyDino casino extends a straightforward welcome bonus, designed to introduce users to its platform. This bonus, comprising favorable conditions, minimizes the time users spend meeting wagering requirements. The LuckyDino welcome bonus, in total, offers €400 and 100 free spins, with the free spins being genuinely free, devoid of wagering requirements, allowing users to withdraw winnings immediately upon spending the cash. However, certain conditions must be met before cashing out.\n\nThe LuckyDino welcome bonus comprises free spins and match deposit cash, awarded upon the first and second deposits. The first deposit triggers a 100% match deposit bonus, while the second deposit activates a 50% match deposit bonus, capped at €200. To fully claim the €400 bonus, deposits totaling over €500 are required. Nevertheless, the LuckyDino casino's conditions make this offer highly attractive.\n\nWhile the free spins have no wagering requirements, users should still be aware of the LuckyDino welcome bonus's terms and conditions. Although these terms are more lenient than those found in other casinos, understanding them is crucial before accepting this offer.\n\nUpon registering at LuckyDino Casino, users are greeted with a welcome bonus, the usage of which is governed by specific terms and conditions, as is the case with all deposit bonuses offered by the casino. Notably, the free spins awarded upon registration are subject to distinct terms, including higher wagering requirements and a €500 withdrawal cap.\n\nBonus Protocols\nCrucially, the welcome bonus functions by intertwining the bonus funds and the user's deposited cash. Both types of funds are used simultaneously for betting, but withdrawals can only be made once the bonus funds have been exhausted. This principle applies not only to the welcome bonus but to all other bonuses, unless explicitly stated otherwise by LuckyDino staff.\n\nWithdrawals are prohibited before the bonus funds have been transformed into real cash, a process that occurs upon fulfillment of the bonus's wagering requirements. Attempting to withdraw funds prematurely results in the permanent forfeiture of the bonus. However, once a bet has been placed using bonus cash, the bonus cannot be forfeited, thereby creating a permanent link between the user's account and the LuckyDino bonus.\n\nWagering Requirements & Limitations\nThe welcome bonus funds must be wagered a total of 60 times before they can be withdrawn. This rule applies universally, with the exception of free spins, which are not subject to wagering requirements.\n\nTo avoid relinquishing accrued winnings and the remaining bonus, users must fulfill LuckyDino's 60-times wagering requirement within seven days of receiving the welcome bonus. This rule is inflexible and applies exclusively to the welcome bonus, unlike other casino offers that may have exceptions. Most video slots contribute to this requirement, excluding titles such as Blood Suckers, Kings of Chicago, Simsalabim, Pure Platinum, and Zombies. However, live and table games do not contribute at all.\n\nDuring the wagering period, bets must not exceed €5 to prevent bonus removal. Only bonus cash, not free spins, should be used to meet the wagering requirement. Although free spins may generate additional funds, these do not count towards the wagering requirement. If a user plays with free spin winnings during the promotion, an extra 60-times wagering requirement will be imposed on those funds.\n\nThe LuckyDino welcome bonus presents an enticing proposition that few can ignore. Upon your initial deposit, your funds will be temporarily interlinked with the bonus amount until the specified terms are fulfilled. Upon meeting these conditions, you will have unrestricted access to withdraw your bonus funds as if they were your own earnings.\n\nWhile such a generous offer is accompanied by standard casino stipulations, LuckyDino's terms are notably fair and customer-oriented, ranking among the most consistent and user-friendly on the web. Should you wish to partake, you will likely find it a rewarding experience. To commence, simply visit the LuckyDino website and establish your account.", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "0c625aec-ebb9-4235-bbee-96fa0ee9bbd2", "url": "https://thecasinowizard.com/bonuses/luckydino-casino-welcome-bonus-100-up-to-e400-100-free-spins/"}

The visuals accompanying the song on the old Captain Kangaroo show, with its sweet and innocent narrative, are still etched in my memory.

{"text": "In the course of events, my RBS Advanta/MINT credit card defaults commenced in mid-2005 following my dismissal from employment. The subsequent billing included now-prohibited charges and Payment Protection Insurance (PPI), which I was informed was inapplicable due to my job loss. I cannot recall if I had requested PPI. The debt was subsequently transferred among various debt collection agencies, including Triton, Newman, and Fredrickson, before ultimately being assigned to Bryan Carter. Bryan Carter secured a County Court Judgment (CCJ) for 10% of the debt, which I diligently paid off over eight months through the prescribed installments.\n\nSubsequently, I received a letter from Bryan Carter stating that the CCJ had been satisfied, but a balance remained, with no clarification on whether the payment should be directed to them or RBS, nor the method or schedule for repayment. After six weeks of silence, I received another letter from Bryan Carter announcing that they had initiated litigation proceedings for the outstanding balance, with the claim form expected to arrive within 48 hours.\n\nIn retrospect, I acknowledge a poor decision in admitting the full debt on the response form, providing detailed personal information and financial circumstances. At the time, I was receiving approximately £350 per month in carer's allowance and income support, with no other income, and was already paying £200 per month towards other debts. I offered £50 per month as a repayment plan, which was the amount I had previously been paying.\n\nThe following correspondence was a CCJ acceptance, instructing me to commence payments of £50 per month starting on the specified date in November 2007, which I faithfully adhered to. The final letter from Bryan Carter, dated January 2008, advised that their client had accepted my offer and to make my first installment by the specified date in February 2008, raising questions about the potential misappropriation of the preceding three months' payments.\n\nGiven these circumstances, I posit that I may have grounds to request that the second CCJ be set aside, considering the potential inclusion of illegal charges and mis-sold PPI, and the apparent contravention of County Court Rules by Bryan Carter in splitting the claim.\n\nAll scanned correspondence and documents are prepared for dispatch, should it be necessary. Suggestions and insights are welcome. Morph. [Link to post] Share across platforms. Bryan Carter has once again engaged in unlawful activities. The second County Court Judgment (CCJ) should be easily set aside, and with the first CCJ, you cannot be pursued for the remaining amount, regardless of past payments or admissions.

Follow the advice of Toulose LeDebt in Post #8 of the other thread; getting the second CCJ set aside appears to be the most viable strategy, given Bryan Carter's unlawful actions.

{"text": "One must commend DOB's journalistic prowess; he meticulously analyzes statistical data, identifies trends, and concurrently, produces insightful game reports and secures compelling quotes. His work eclipses that of his peers, including Jason Bowman, in my estimation. However, his blog exhibits a certain volatility, akin to a ballplayer's heated exchange with a heckler. Yet, his content is not to be missed, as exemplified by Morgan Ensberg's blog.\n\nStu astutely points out an unusual application of Major League Baseball's substance abuse policy. Edinson Volquez, a Cincinnati Reds pitcher, has been suspended for 50 games after testing positive for a banned substance. However, this suspension will not affect his return to the mound, as he is already on the 60-day disabled list following Tommy John surgery. His recovery is not expected to be complete until after the All-Star break. This situation is both peculiar and advantageous for fantasy league participants, as jorgbacca aptly notes.\n\nLast night, I witnessed Minor's pitching for the M-Braves. His performance was commendable, with his fastball displaying notable velocity. He maintained a speed of approximately 92 mph for the initial innings, which then dropped to around 88-89 mph in the subsequent two. Minor demonstrated proficiency in keeping the ball low in the strike zone, allowing no hard hits against him. While he might have benefited from some favorable strike calls on lower pitches, overall, his performance was impressive.\n\nIn a separate discussion, the definition of'semi-big' was debated, with 'one-time all-star not in a major market' being proposed. This is a fair interpretation, as 'big', 'not big', and'semi-big' could be used to describe Volquez's status.\n\nIn another comment, the cost of pay versus playing time (PT) was discussed, with the opinion that teams can prioritize one without compromising the other, which is acceptable to other team owners.\n\nLastly, a prediction was made that the outcome of the current series could significantly influence the rest of the season, with the winner potentially clinching the pennant and the loser securing the Wild Card spot.\n\nMark Bowman's proclivity for convoluted sentence structures and elongated thoughts, which could baffle even the seasoned diplomat John Kerry, often results in writing that is challenging to comprehend. Dave O'Brien of the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, a professional with a superior command of language, has remarked, \"It's as if Bowman is single-handedly waging war on the English language.\" O'Brien, who shares similar journalistic responsibilities with Bowman, also noted Bowman's substantial weight, stating, \"He's morbidly obese.\"\n\njjschiller, in a separate comment, expressed disapproval of Bowman's writing style, comparing it to an unprofessional argument between a manager and a customer at a fast-food restaurant. In a subsequent exchange, O'Brien made a typographical error, stating that Jason Heyward had 15 home runs instead of 15 runs batted in. A user, OptimisticInTexas, corrected this mistake, leading to a humorous response from O'Brien, who acknowledged the typo and playfully defended his accuracy. Another user, spike, agreed with the initial criticism of Bowman's writing.\n\nTennessee Paul's initial enthusiasm, which may have been excessive, has proven justified as the young player, after 12 games, has maintained an impressive batting average of.441, with an on-base percentage of.441, a slugging percentage of.971, and an OPS of 1.412, accompanied by five home runs and 12 runs batted in. This remarkable performance, surpassing even the lofty expectations, suggests a promising future. While it is important to consider various contextual factors, the early results are indeed encouraging and bode well for the player's career. The humor in the situation lies in the fact that, at this stage, the player's on-base percentage was equal to his batting average. Some users, however, question the necessity of responding to minor errors, such as typographical mistakes, in online forums, suggesting that such corrections should be made discreetly without drawing attention.\n\nNevertheless, in response to point #7, I briefly reviewed today's DOB forum and, I must admit, \"Keep up the good fight, DOB.\" I, too, have a comparable role and concur that excessive interaction with irrational or trivial individuals is unproductive, but witnessing another author engage in such a manner elicits a subtle sense of satisfaction, reminiscent of the Jersey Shore's celebratory fist-pump. Subsequently, I find myself feeling somewhat less informed. Stu, April 20, 2010, 4:34 PM. DOB's intolerance of criticism, even when merited, is evident. Indeed, jjschiller, April 20, 2010, 4:36 PM. Perhaps my irritation stems from solely scanning comments for DOB's updates, with his responses to detractors being notably acerbic. Furthermore, engaging with such individuals only serves to validate their behavior, exacerbating the situation. spike (back in the USA), April 20, 2010, 4:48 PM. A substantial rain shower is currently underway near the stadium, but it should subside by game time. spike (back in the USA), April 20, 2010, 4:55 PM. DOB clarifies that Adenolith is not his true middle name – \"In fact, his middle name is Alias, pronounced 'Uh-li-as,' similar to the Elias Sports Bureau. I inquired about the origin of Adenolith approximately 15 minutes ago. He was unaware of its source, as his middle name is not listed in the media guide. He was not upset, simply stating that Adenolith was not his middle name and providing his actual middle name.\"\n\nIn my inquiry about Alias' moniker, he elucidated that it was biblical in origin, symbolizing \"strength, courage, and perseverance.\" He clarified that it was not a familial appellation, stating, \"It's just my name.\" When I suggested including his full name in the media guide to prevent confusion, he responded, \"Why? I don't go by that.\" Thus, the revelation: Alias is indeed his middle name, pronounced \"Uh-li-as.\" I, for one, am left disheartened by this revelation, bidding farewell to the moniker 'Death Lion.'\n\nOur revenue streams are multifaceted, encompassing advertising, broadcasting rights, Major League Baseball's intellectual property, ticket sales, and various other sources. It's important to note that while I may not currently recall every source, it's not due to any lack of intelligence. One significant aspect is that advertising, particularly television commercials, constitutes a substantial portion of our income. If the broadcasters allot 2 minutes and 5 seconds for advertisements, we adhere to that duration.\n\nI must emphasize that I do not consider the average fan to be uninformed. While there may be exceptions, such as the individual who spat on me at Wrigley Field, I believe most fans possess a reasonable understanding. If I were to explain the necessity of these breaks, I doubt they would react with violence. Instead, I imagine they would express understanding, perhaps even stating, \"I don't enjoy the wait, but I comprehend the reason behind the 2 minutes and 5 seconds between innings. I would likely make the same decision if I were in your position. Perhaps I'll go get another hot dog in the meantime.\"\n\nI suggest, Morgan, that you simply inform the fans that the pace of the game is influenced by financial considerations. This honesty will not portray you as a greedy commissioner, but rather as a straightforward individual who appreciates their understanding. Fans can then empathize with your position, recognizing that, like them, we play for financial reasons.\n\nRandy's enthusiastic endorsement of a song, followed by a comparative assessment of musical talents, adds a lighthearted touch to the conversation.\n\nThe television series \"Alias\" featured Jennifer Garner in the lead role, who is married to actor Ben Affleck. Affleck's long-standing friendship, or \"bromance,\" is with fellow actor Matt Damon. Damon himself starred in \"The Legend of Bagger Vance,\" directed by Robert Redford, who also helmed \"Lions for Lambs.\" Notably, Damon appeared in \"The Departed,\" a film that could be metaphorically linked to the phrase \"dead lions,\" or even \"death lion,\" given the narrative's themes.\n\nIn an unrelated discussion, a user, Weldon, questioned whether Chip had ever produced a film as poorly received as \"Groovy Kind of Love.\" Another user, spike, humorously interjected with a fictional pornographic film title, \"The Legend Of Teabagger Vance.\"\n\nMeanwhile, a biblical scholar pointed out that while \"Alias\" does not appear in the Bible, \"Aliah,\" a variant that could be translated to \"Alias\" in Greek, does, albeit only once, as a mistranslation for \"Alvah,\" a ruler of Edom. The correct Greek translation for \"Elijah\" is \"Elias.\"\n\nIn a separate conversation, a user, drew, pondered if there was a city less deserving of a quality sports team than Philadelphia. Another user, jjschiller, responded pragmatically, stating that scoring a run was already a necessity, regardless of the team's location.\n\nOne must commend the Phillies for their tenacious performance; they exhibit remarkable resilience at the plate, rarely succumbing to strikeouts. However, Hanson's pitching, while formidable, is proving inefficient, having already thrown 90 pitches in just four innings. This is concerning, regardless of the opposition's batting prowess. The game thus far has been quite frustrating to watch, with Hanson's pitch count continuing to rise, reaching 88 after four innings, suggesting a reliance on the bullpen for the later innings. The experience of stepping on a venomous copperhead during a run at a nature sanctuary was an alarming, slow-motion 'oh shit' moment, but thankfully, the individual is recovering well and recommends avoiding such encounters.\n\nIn a fortunate turn of events, my partner, who has an intense fear of snakes stemming from what she believes was a close brush with death, has been showering me with tender loving care. She has prepared a meal for me and is currently tidying my residence and attending to my laundry while I enjoy a baseball game. The swelling is expected to subside within a few days, so I am making the most of this situation. I do, however, wish that the Braves would perform more to my liking.\n\nMeanwhile, I must concur with the sentiments expressed by another user regarding Hanson's pitch count. It is indeed unreasonable for him to have thrown 90 pitches in just four innings, regardless of the opposing team's batting prowess. He needs to improve his pitch efficiency.\n\nIn other news, Kendrick has thrown 33 pitches in three innings, a feat that seems scarcely believable. How such a scenario could unfold is a mystery.\n\nI must admit, my patience with Glaus is wearing thin. While he has been somewhat unlucky, his defensive miscues and failures to deliver with runners on base have begun to irritate me greatly. Other users have expressed similar sentiments.\n\nHistory has led me to expect a sudden four-run surge from the Phillies at this juncture. However, I find myself hoping for better performance from Freeman.\n\nWhile typically composed, I find myself joining the chorus advocating for a change in the current situation involving Troy Glaus. Though I remain hopeful that he could still turn his performance around, it is evident that an improvement is needed following the departure of McCann. Two left-handed hitters back-to-back may not be ideal, but perhaps moving Heyward to the fifth spot in the lineup could mitigate this. Alternatively, swapping Yunel and Glaus could also be a viable solution.\n\nIn a hypothetical scenario where Glaus had a vested interest in the Phillies' success, one might argue that he would have exerted more effort to improve his performance in the game. However, his defensive abilities have been called into question, with some comparing him unfavorably to former players like Rico Brogna and Scott Thorman. Despite these criticisms, at least Brogna was praised for his defensive contributions.\n\nAs the game progressed, Tommy Hanson's pitching was a source of disappointment, lasting only 4.2 innings. The decision to remove him was likely made to protect his arm, a strategic move by manager Bobby Cox. Ultimately, the question remained: could Troy Glaus be held accountable for the loss?\n\nIt's challenging to instruct Tommy to cease attempting to blow the ball past infielders when the first baseman misdirects it to right field, and the left fielder takes a leisurely lunch break in Marietta while a single is being fielded. Predictable? Hardly. Swinging at a 92 mph fastball on a 2-0 count and then hitting the next pitch into the dirt for a double play is not a strategy for success. Nevertheless, Bobby, Hinske's performance is commendable...\nI've lost the recording on my DVR, but is there a reason I can't start watching now?\nChief Nocahoma\nApril 20, 2010, 8:15 PM\nAs I've repeatedly stated, until the Braves' offense is bolstered, their pitching will only allow them to be a.500 team. While Heyward is an upgrade, the other outfielders are AAAA players, Glaus is effectively an independent league player at this point, and Chipper's health is a concern.\njjschiller\nApril 20, 2010, 8:27 PM\nChipper's extra-base hit tonight is our only bright spot...\nThat's some impressive hitting, indeed.\nHanan\nApril 20, 2010, 8:30 PM\nStarting to hit some line drives against Kendrick, but Victorino is channeling his inner Garry Maddox out there. I never cared for Maddox, and Victorino is even less appealing.\nIncidents like this occur when there are sure outs in the 1, 5, 7, and 8 spots in the lineup tonight.\njjschiller\nApril 20, 2010, 8:55 PM\nJon K,\nIf you can't contribute humor, then be original, or it's just annoying. You're not invited to this commiseration session.\nstupup74\nApril 20, 2010, 9:00 PM\n\nThe 'Acosta' role in the bullpen, often a source of amusement, is a significant asset, providing a dedicated figure to manage that position and alleviate pressure on the pitching staff. The bullpen has been performing commendably, but the team's inability to score runs in half of their games is a pressing concern that must be addressed. As the season progresses, it is inevitable that Chavez will assume a high-leverage role, marking a substantial improvement. Last year, I witnessed Kendrick struggle against our Triple-A team, with Phillies fans expressing their displeasure as he left the field each half inning. McCann's on-base presence could spell trouble, as Glaus looms as a formidable threat. Despite this, our relief corps, led by Wagner, Saito, and Venters, provides a strong foundation, with a reliable Triple-A starter available to pitch long innings if necessary.\n\nWith unerring precision, this player can send any pitch soaring over the fence, or drive it to the deepest corners of the field.

Meanwhile, horses like Haddex, Obeaux, and Nube Jackpot for today, while capable, must elevate their game significantly to compete in this contest.\n\nIn the postponed Fighting Fifth Hurdle at Newcastle, the exceptional Constitution Hill, trained by Nicky Henderson, makes his belated debut over hurdles.

If you missed last week's gathering, you can find it here. Let's commence by exploring my recent activities:\n\nOn Monday, I shared simple yet elegant ideas for Valentine's Day displays as part of the 'Vintage Valentine's Day Blog Hop'. This event featured 25 creative bloggers, and I've compiled links to their posts at the end of mine.\n\nYesterday, as part of my 'Pin Away Wednesday' series, I showcased inspiring images from my 'Dark Woodwork and Stained Trim' Pinterest board. I find the beauty and warmth of unpainted woodwork, moldings, and trims truly captivating.\n\nTomorrow, I'll be joining a group of skilled bloggers for a Valentine's Day tablescape blog hop, hosted by the talented Chloe of 'Celebrate and Decorate'. The hop began on Monday, so you can start exploring the beautiful Valentine's Day table settings anytime.\n\nGood morning, Amber!

Wishing you peace from the enchanting, icy, frosted woods where I'm typing this.\n\n\"Greetings on this Tablescape Thursday, Barb, and I must express my admiration for your Valentine's day posts – they're simply delightful! I plan to spend the weekend exploring Pinterest for inspiration, as I often do. Today, I've contributed three ideas to our shared collection: (#79) a serene tablescape for two, (#82) a budget-friendly thrift shop find for under $10, and (#83) a tutorial on creating your own Valentine's linens, which I've also shared on Bev's Eclectic Red Barn. I must confess, I got a bit carried away and posted them all at once – my apologies for the lack of spacing! The beauty of these tablescapes is truly inspiring. I've ensured to backlink for everyone's convenience and have also mentioned Amber's tablescape party on my Facebook page, hoping to attract more visitors. Have a wonderful Thursday, and I'm pleased to be here earlier than usual. Warm regards, Barb.\"\n\n\"Thank you, Amber, for hosting this weekly event – I'm at posts 146, 147, and 148 this week. I hope you'll join me at Homestyle Gathering and share your projects with our readers. Hi Amber, I'm grateful for your hosting and the wealth of ideas I've gained from this party.

Post #163 showcased a Valentine's Day tablescape in the romantic setting of the Eiffel Tower, while #164 celebrated President's Day with a birthday party featuring Abe and George.\n\nEmily, I am truly thankful for your feature of my Chinese New Year post, which brought a welcome respite on a particularly challenging day.

{"text": "Crafting Christmas cards can be an enjoyable task, and it's wise to gather ideas and materials early to ensure timely completion. Last month, I hosted a card-making event, which was well-attended and appreciated by all participants. However, one card design encountered an issue during production. I often use new tools and dies without extensive testing, which led to a malfunction on the third attempt with one particular die. Unfortunately, it continued to fail even after multiple tries, causing frustration, but I found solace in the fact that this happened in a class setting rather than at home as a customer.\n\nI salvaged the supplies and repurposed them for long-overdue card swaps, making some design adjustments in the process. The revised cards bore a resemblance to the original, featuring vanilla and copper foil accents. However, my frustration led me to explore a different color scheme for the revised version, resulting in a stunning, traditional Christmas color palette. The cable knit folder, a versatile embellishment, was used to create a cozy card design, perfect for both Christmas and non-holiday occasions. To prevent tearing, remember to mist the folder with water and alcohol before embossing.\n\nThe tiny bow from the original card was the source of the initial difficulty, but a thinner version caused no issues during production. I completed seven cuts in mere minutes. With the recent temperature drop from 98°F to 85°F, it seemed fitting to incorporate a sweater-inspired design into my card creations. Using the cable knit dynamic embossing folder, I crafted a warm and inviting card, aptly suited for the cooler weather.\n\nUpon laying eyes on this sketch, I instantly envisioned its potential. The slanted sweater piece, paired with the novel Copper Foil, captivated me. I experimented with various embellishments for the central focus, eventually settling on a button and bow. Though the sketch suggested placing the sentiment on the sweater, I found it more harmonious off to the side. This card has become a favorite, potentially gracing the \"Card Buffet\" later this month, and could serve as an excellent teaching tool in a class.\n\nA tip when using this rigid, thick folder: lightly mist your cardstock or paper with water before embossing. This softens the paper fibers, allowing it to better conform to the folder's intricate details. Ensure it's dry before adhering it to your project. I regret not following this advice, as my cardstock appears somewhat rough.\n\nI've had the pleasure of previewing the other designers' interpretations of this sketch. I encourage you to view them at Create with Connie and Mary. Our hope is that they inspire you to participate in our creative challenge.\n\nThis month's theme, \"Mini Catalog Favorites,\" presents a challenge, as the Stampin' Up Holiday mini catalog is filled with appealing options. I narrowed it down to specific stamp sets, a punch, some Designer Series Paper (DSP), trims, and the new foil. To showcase these, I created a charming holiday treat bag ensemble.\n\nFour bags were crafted, suitable for treats, small gifts, or even gift cards, over the next few months. Each features the same size wrap-around band and velcro closure, with a firm cardboard base for stability. Measurements are provided at the end. Can you guess the verdict? Simply, \"A D O R A B L E.\"\n\nThis inaugural bag is a quintessential autumn/winter creation, as our climate seldom necessitates cable-knit sweaters. Nevertheless, I am enamored with this Cable Knit Dynamic embossing folder, which imparts the appearance of one. I have paired it with the novel Copper Foil, an indispensable addition to my crafting repertoire. I have crafted a 'button' to showcase its lustrous sheen, evoking images of warm beverages and indulgent treats. The cozy allure of this bag is undeniable.\n\nThe Halloween bag is a straightforward yet effective vessel for spooky treats. I employed the Cookie Cutter Halloween stamp set and the Cookie Cutter Builder punch to achieve this effect. To add intricate detail to the mummy, I first stamped it in Staz On ink and then onto Shimmery White Card Stock, which is compatible with blender pens.\n\nFor the fall/Thanksgiving bag, I chose a detailed scarecrow design. I utilized the Serene Scenery DSP from the larger catalog, along with a blender pen and various ink pads to color him in on Shimmery White Card Stock. The new Kraft Rope trim added a touch of realism to his limbs, resembling straw.\n\nThe Christmas bag completes the collection, offering a simple yet elegant design. By the time the holiday season arrives, few have the time or energy for elaborate crafting. I opted for a simple stamped image, accentuated with a piece of ribbon along the side.\n\nNow that you have admired my treat bags, allow me to elucidate their creation process:\n\nTreat Bag Foundation:\n- Commence with Kraft Tag a Bag Gift bags\n- Remove 1/8th of the bottom to facilitate opening\n- On the bottom, score at 1 1/2 inches, parallel to the base\n- Rotate the bag twice, scoring 1 1/2 inches from the top (along the outermost part of the serrated curve)\n- Cut 1 inch up to the score line, parallel to the outer edge, and repeat on the other side\n\nTo commence, crease 'bottom' score lines inwards, ensuring the bottom sides remain puffy while the top transitions to a flat state. Subsequently, fold down the top score line, utilizing the interior piece for the robust cardboard base, measuring 2 5/8 inches by 2 inches. For the Bag Band, prepare a 2 x 8 1/2 inch strip of card stock, accompanied by two DSP pieces, each measuring 2 x 1 3/4 inches and 2 3/4 x 1 3/4 inches, respectively. Adhere these pieces to the exterior flaps. This process is straightforward; should you require any clarification, please do not hesitate to contact me. Having perused a selection of my personal favorites, I invite you to explore Anne Power's preferences as well.", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "6750d188-3422-4140-b254-2e7f48574067", "url": "https://libbystamps.com/tag/cable-knit-dynamic-ef/"}
