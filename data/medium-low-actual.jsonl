Director Aneesh Anwar used his direction pretty well, but here and there some zigzags in the script take the show away from him in this love triangle, while the story is good and we recommend it as a watchable one........\n\nHere goes the story, Churatta Jose performed by Indrajith, takes the rescue of catching snakes when people asked him to do so and a part time rowdy. Churatta Jose offers his services as a goon to the landlords of his village. Mainly in the service of Sunny enacted by Tiny Tom, and Tomy performed by Ashokan. In this juncture of his life Churatta Jose met Suchitra done by Meghnaraj, during one of his part time service as rowdy. All this hiccups began with the arrival of Kumaran in the life of Churatta Jose, Kumaran's daughter Suchitra and Rani Mol characterized by Ananya, are now the part of this love triangle and rest of the story revolve around the family of Kumaran and his daughters that led to the form up of \"Mullamottum Munthiricharum\".\n\nIndrajith as usual justified his character of Churatta Jose and Meghnaraj also managed her character pretty well. Ananya surprised with her bubbly acting in a humorous way. Thilakan, Tiny Tom, Ashokan, Praveena, Anil Murali, Kochupreman and others have made their characters suits to the occasion. Aneesh Anwar's debut malayalam movie discuss a healthy story, but the script by Biju K.Joseph fails to put up the impression. Its takes a long to finish, it may take the toll of audience.\n\nSajith Vasudev's cinematography is appreciable in the background of Thodupuzha and Babu Rathnam cuts the reel nicely. Songs are nice with the hands of Mohan Sithara and lyrics from Engendiyoor Chandrashekharan and Kaithapram. Joseph Nellickal done the Art Direction. For the banner of Jyothirgamaya, Soman Pallattu and Mary Soman are the producers of this malayalam movie \"Mullamottum Munthiricharum\".\n\nDrop your opinions on this malayalam film \"Mullamottum Munthiricharum\" through comments........", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "fcae510d-c454-4a45-ad2e-7dbb8bbadd18", "url": "http://malayalamscinema.blogspot.com/2012/07/review-mullamottum-munthiricharum.html"}

Yes all major holiday centres have their tourist concentrations but the great majority of the island is unspoilt to such an extent that it is designated as a Biosphere by the United Nations, as a place with outstanding and unusual interest. There are few volcanic archipelagos that have remained uncovered by foliage and unaffected by erosion. Over 300 volcanoes remain in pristine condition with the Timanfaya Volcano park attracting thousands of visitors yet still remaining unspoiled, thanks to careful management by the National Parks Department.\n\nApart form its wonderful beaches, all colours, not just black, the island has much to offer in cultural attractions, thanks to the legendary work of Cesar Manrique who designed and built many eco edifices which are well worth a visit and only a short journey away. In fact there is so much to see in a small area that it is worth hiring a car. The road system is excellent and not busy outside the main tourist areas. Petrol is a lot cheaper than the UK and it would be unusual to get through more than 10 Euros worth in a week.\n\nThis information is presented by Holistic Holidays, who appreciate Lanzarote for its warm waters, clean air and unspoilt scenery. When you come, perhaps you should keep the Lanzagrotty myth alive, so that too many people don't come and spoil it!\n\nDo take a look at the Holistic Holidaysphotographic gallery which show you lots of beautiful scenery of the Lanzarote Biosphere, including beaches, islands, volcanoes, flowers, wildlife as well as the creations of Cesar Manrique\n\nEnjoy your holiday in Lanzarote!\n\nA cheap last minute holiday is possible as there is a good choice of budget accommodation in Lanzarote.

{"text": "Broncos' Bowlen busy interviewing head-coaching candidates\n\nENGLEWOOD, Colo. -- Pat Bowlen wants to return to the Super Bowl after a decade's drought, and he believes last year's participants just might hold the key.\n\nOne day after interviewing Giants defensive coordinator Steve Spagnuolo in New York, the Denver Broncos' owner met Sunday with New England Patriots offensive coordinator Josh McDaniels in the Boston area.\n\nBowlen is searching for a replacement for head coach Mike Shanahan, whom he fired last week after 14 seasons. Shanahan won back-to-back Super Bowls in the late 1990s, but just one playoff game in the 10 years since Hall of Fame quarterback John Elway retired.\n\nMcDaniels is a 32-year-old rising star who worked his way up from graduate assistant to offensive coordinator for Patriots coach Bill Belichick. Under McDaniels' tutelage, Tom Brady threw for a record 50 touchdowns last season, and the Patriots came within a game of the first 19-0 season in NFL history.\n\nBill Sikes / Associated Press\n\nNew England Patriots offensive coordinator Josh McDaniels interviewed for the Denver Broncos' head-coaching job Sunday after talking to the Cleveland Browns about their vacancy last week.\n\nMcDaniels' reputation grew ever larger this season when Brady was lost with a knee injury in the opener, and backup QB Matt Cassel, who hadn't started a game since high school, led the Patriots to an 11-5 record.\n\nSpagnuolo, 49, who spurned the Washington Redskins last year, is the architect of the pass rush that stymied Brady in last season's Super Bowl stunner. Spagnuolo's credentials also were burnished this season when the Giants earned the No. 1 seed in the NFC playoffs despite the retirement of seven-time Pro Bowl defensive end Michael Strahan and the loss of fellow Pro Bowl defensive end Osi Umenyiora to a knee injury in the preseason.\n\nGarrett comes in Tuesday. He spurned offers from the Baltimore Ravens and Atlanta Falcons last offseason after Cowboys owner Jerry Jones upped his salary to about $3 million and pledged to make him head coach Wade Phillips' eventual successor.\n\nDennison will interview Wednesday. He who played linebacker for the Broncos from 1982 to 1990, joined Shanahan's staff in 1995 and coached special teams and the offensive line before being elevated to offensive coordinator three years ago.\n\nMcDaniels also interviewed for the Cleveland Browns' head-coaching vacancy Friday.\n\nThe Broncos need lots of help on defense, where they ranked 30th in the NFL in points allowed this season, went through six free safeties and six linebackers, and couldn't stop the run under Bob Slowik, their third defensive coordinator in the last three seasons.\n\nWhen Bowlen fired Shanahan last week with three years and more than $20 million left on his contract, the owner said he wanted a replacement who would immediately put the Broncos back among the league's elite.\n\nThe Broncos also put out feelers to gauge the interest of University of Oklahoma head coach Bob Stoops, who's preparing for his fourth shot at a national championship when the Sooners face Florida in the BCS title game Thursday night.\n\nBowlen is an Oklahoma graduate.\n\nOn Saturday, however, Stoops dismissed the notion that he was ready to leave the college ranks for Denver: \"There's no story,\" Stoops said. \"I'm not a candidate.\"\n\nBowlen doesn't want his new coach to have full control of the team as Shanahan did, so after he hires a coach, he'll set out to hire a general manager. One intriguing possibility is Scott Pioli, the Patriots' vice president of football operations.\n\nThe Broncos are 24-24 in the last three seasons and are mired in a three-year postseason drought for the first time since 1982. This season, they led the AFC West by three games with three weeks to go, then became the first team in league history to blow such a lead when they were trounced 52-21 by the San Diego Chargers last week to finish 8-8.\n\nShanahan, who was 146-91 in 14 seasons in Denver, was fired 48 hours later.\n\nIt appears Shanahan will sit out the 2009 season and look to land a prime NFL coaching job in 2010, when fellow free agents Bill Cowher and Mike Holmgren also might be rejoining the coaching ranks.\n\nShanahan told the NFL Network's Adam Schefter in an interview that aired Sunday that if he does take a year off from coaching, he'll take computer courses and spend some time learning how to send e-mails and text messages.\n\nShanahan will stick around Denver, where crews are putting the finishes touches on his 35,000-square foot mansion and where he recently broke ground on a steakhouse. He'll also get an up-close view of the rebuilding job his successor tackles with the Broncos.", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "68e993a5-d144-40a9-893b-7519599c6389", "url": "http://www.nfl.com/news/story/09000d5d80ddfb7b/article/broncos-bowlen-busy-interviewing-headcoaching-candidates"}

All weekend and today I did this dish at Farm Market Demos and gave a real boost to the farms selling the ingredients. I also did it for a dinner this past Tuesday, it was a multi course tasting menu and the plate with the sweet potato has came back clean from all 4 diners.

Dump them in a pan that has been drizzled with olive oil. Saute at medium heat for about 10 minutes and throw in the onions.

I have always loved sweet potatoes, but when I started trying to watch my weight and choose more healthful options several years ago, they became a go-to ataple at my house.\n\nMy general method is to slice them in rounds or like traditional french fries, toss them in a bowl with olive oil, put them on a cookie sheet, salt and pepper, bake a while, turn and finish.\n\nLike yours, there are never any left over.

I am a firm believer that Prairie View Produces Productive People because their are so many great influences on this campus you cant help but to be motivated to achieve great goals. While there are some teachers who could care less about you but thats college for you, NO BABYSITTING IS ALOWWED AT THE UNIVERSITY!!! But, Of course, it is just like any other college and has their flaws but I can say it does...\n\nI just completed my first year at Prairie View A&M University and it has been a very good experience. My mother went to PVU and I was mostly prepared when I got here. I have met many wonderful people from all over Texas and other states during my first year.\n\nI give this college institution, Prairie View A&M University, a rate of an 8 on a scale of 1 to 10. I love Prairie View A&M University! Prairie View is a productive institution that produces even greater students that become successful people.\n\nPrairie View A&M has it's flaws, as many schools due but overall is a wonderful school to earn your degree. The student teacher ratio is small which allows you to develop a great professional relationship with professors. Faculty may be hard on you but it is only because they want to see you achieve.\n\nApr-24-2013I am\nresearching this school and\nhave not visited the campus\n\nWhen the principal and some people from the admissions office came down to Anchorage, AK to get more students I knew that they cared a lot about our education and our future goals. They shared some of their personal experiences and really opened up to us. After they were done I went straight there website and did some research. The school seems very involved in their community and students and it looks like a great place to be. I'm planning on applying here very soon.\n\nPrairie View A&M University is a great place of higher learning. I love how the teachers take the time to get to know their students.

{"text": "Joel Prieto and Rachel Willis-Sørensen, who gave the significant stand-out performance in the Houston Grand Opera production of Don Giovanni.\nPhoto Courtesy of Houston Grand Opera, Photo by Felix Sanchez\n\nSometimes you're so wicked you get dragged down to hell. Sometimes you're so wicked, you don't even care.\n\nCentral to Mozart's Don Giovanni is the vicarious thrill of bad behavior while making audiences feel a little dirty for enjoying the Don's wicked ways. Don Giovanni appears at the Houston Grand Opera not to damn but to save the season from the debacle that is Show Boat. But you may not hear angels singing just yet. This Don Giovanni shines at some stellar moments but too often singes when it should scorch.\n\nIf an opera's protagonist makes a practice of seducing or assaulting women and keeping elaborate records of his conquests in a little black book, we should assume he might throb with charisma and allure. Nearly seven years ago, just after moving to Houston, I saw this very production of Don Giovanni at HGO during the 2006-7 season and still remember the sensational and sexy Mariusz Kwiecien.\n\nNow there's a singer you'd follow down into flames.\n\nWith an often-ill-fitting cloak and wig, this Don looked more Edward Cullen than Jacob Black.\n\nThis season's Don, Adrian Eröd, was technically flawless in his HGO debut Friday night but only occasionally enthralling. With an often-ill-fitting cloak and wig, he looked more Edward Cullen than Jacob Black.\n\nForgive me the gratuitous reference to Twilight: I blame the pasty makeup. Besides, if, like Don Giovanni, your conquests includes hundreds of women across Europe, you might want to seem more the brawny werewolf than the sensitive vampire.\n\nChance to shine\n\nThe failure of the Don to seize center stage in the first act offered the non-leading men a chance to shine. Kyle Ketelsen made for a potent Leporello: funny, booming, and always about to upstage the Don. Someone I chatted with during the intermission, who had never seen the opera before, was quite a fan.\n\n\"Maybe he and the Don should switch,\" she said.\n\nJoel Prieto's HGO debut proves persuasive in portraying Don Ottavio. His voice was perfectly that of a faithful young lover: sweet, clear, and forceful.\n\nOn a few occasions I had the pleasure of hearing a young Michael Sumuel sing when he was the student of my colleagues at Rice's Shepherd School of Music. A former HGO Studio Artist and a stellar Schaunard in HGO's La Boheme this season, Sumuel was a very fine Masetto. As Don Giovanni was stealing his fiancé, Zerlina, Masetto was nearly stealing the scene.\n\nBoth Prieto and Sumuel struggled at times to rise above the orchestra, which appeared to be a consequence of awkward positioning. They weren't the only ones. Singers were too often facing odd directions or trapped upstage on a raked surface that had visual if not acoustic appeal.\n\nThis was not the only feature of the production that seemed to cool the flames ignited by Don Giovanni's infamous appetites. Blocking was frequently static or stilted. The tempo felt slow, especially in the first act, rendering the powerful \"La ci darem il mano\" pedestrian. The Don is a creature of libido, and libido is rarely pleasing when sluggish.\n\nPowerful women\n\nIt is a strength of Lorenzo Da Ponte's libretto that three powerful and distinct women anchor Don Giovanni. Donna Anna, Donna Elvira, and Zerlina represent the past, present, and future objects of the Don's lust.\n\nWhether mournful or vengeful, Willis-Sørensen was utterly convincing.\n\nThe significant stand-out performance came without question from Rachel Willis-Sørensen. As a woman who narrowly saves herself from the Don's assault only to later discover he has slain her father, Donna Anna constantly must sound the siren of alarm throughout the opera with only her voice. Whether mournful or vengeful, Willis-Sørensen was utterly convincing.\n\nThe same couldn't be said for Malin Christensson who seemed to struggle both dramatically and vocally with Zerlina. And while Veronika Dzhioeva fared somewhat better as an adequate Donna Elvira, she was far from Ana Maria Martinez's electrifying Elvira in 2006. I can still hear her shrieks of terror and rage.\n\nSecond act perks up\n\nIn spite of an underwhelming first act, the second perked up considerably. Suddenly the Don seemed more like someone you'd jump out of a window for if he serenaded from below.\n\nBut the most potent moments came in moments of ensemble singing — the masked Donna Anna, Donna Elvira, and Don Ottavio signing downstage to the audience or later an ensemble of six confused by the wily Don. There's an appealing additive quality to Don Giovanni as Mozart builds duets into trios into quartets into sestets to suggest a gorgeously expanding universe of sound.\n\nAt the end, the Don faces off with his victim, the murdered Commendatore, who returns as a ghostly statue to harrow the sinful man. The deep, throaty Morris Robinson exposed in the final scene the terror that was always hovering beneath the often-playful absurdity of the plot. Defiant to the end, the Don sinks into a square of smoke and orange light, leaving behind only victims who cheer his demise and a sad, limp wig.", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "ec0e05c9-3364-475d-a3cf-d16c7b98ccab", "url": "http://houston.culturemap.com/news/entertainment/01-26-13-16-19-the-thrill-of-bad-behavior-hgos-idon-giovanni-i-goes-to-the-dark-side-but-is-not-wicked-enough/"}

{"text": "My husband JC have been married 15 years, but are are new to the poly world. At this point, he has a secondary relationship and I am going through a long process of self reflection before I will be ready for another relationship.\n\nIn 2006 we met a lovely young girl that became our lover, eventhough that wasn't really the plan. We intended on having a 3-some with her and it turned into a much deeper relationship. She was open about our relationship with her family and friends, but I couldn't reiprocate. She ended the relationship when she realized she would have to be the closeted lover and was not happy with that.\n\nRecently JC met Bee online. Their friendship quickly grew and they began sexting frequently. JC is a very flirty guy and this didn't bother me at all. I could tell their relationship was getting serious and I decided to discuss it with him. It was then that JC decided to tell me he was very interested in her and he had developed an emotional relationship with her. At first, it was hard for me to take as we really hadn't discussed being poly. but after some deep conversations with JC and some soul searching within myself, I was able to accept it. Since Bee lives many states away from us, it was easy for me to accept this long-distance relationship. Since then, they have decided to meet.\n\nJC is going up to meet her next weekend and I am starting to freak out! I know my feelings are out of control. JC and I have been married for a long time and have survived hard times. Our relationship is solid and I'm not worried about him leaving me. I know that his relationship with Bee will not directly affect my relationship with JC. In fact it has brought us closer together. I have \"met\" Bee and she and I have become good friends. In fact, I am closer to her than any other friend in my life, ever. I am going through a lot of personal changes and she has been a great confidant for me. I can talk to her about every aspect in my life except JC. We have decided to leave him out of our conversations so we don't cross any lines. This was mostly to protect Bee since she is so far away from JC she can't have the phyical relationship I have with him.\n\nBut now I really need someone to talk to about this and I have no one! Bee is the only friend I have that knows JC and I are in an open relationship and I can't talk to her about it. I think it would be unfair to both of them for me to discuss my inability to control my feelings.\n\nI would love to have a friendship with an person I'm not involved with who is going through the same things as me. Someone who also needs a friend to gripe to, confide in with no judgements. So, if there is anyone out there willing to talk me through these hard times, I would love to hear from you!\n\ni dont know alot about this but im a good listener so u can talk 2 me my name is dawn i live in davenport ia with my boyfriend we've been togeather for 2 yrs. if u dont want 2 talk 2 me i understand and good luck\n\nI'm really not sure what I'm afraid of. I am feeling scared, nervous, sad and left out. and he hasn't even left yet!\n\nPart of it is just being apart. The only time we have apart for an extended amount of time was when we evacuated after Hurrican Katrina. I went to OK to stay with family, but JC stayed close to home so he could get back to the house as soon as possible. So I know that it part of my feelings is just separation anxiety.\n\nI am nervous about what it will be like when he returns. We have no secrets and for the past 15 years we have shared all of our life experiences. Now he'll have this trip with Bee and I know he'll want to talk about it. Not kiss and tell, but where did they go, what sites they saw... and I don't know if I'll be able to listen to his stories without going \"there\". You know, start wondering what else they did together that they don't want to share with me. And then I'm down the jealousy rabbit hole! But at the same time, I hate to tell him not to talk about the trip at all because I don't want to start feeling like he has a secret. Am I going to be able to recover from that? Or is it going to make us drift apart?\n\nAlso, I don't feel comfortable talking to either one of them during the trip because I don't want to intrude. But that makes me feel left out. And I don't like that feeling. They are going this journey together and I don't get to go. I'm not included. This is the feeling that is really getting to me.\n\nI also worried about how this will affect my friendship with Bee. Will I feel wierd talking to her afterwards? Will she feel wierd talking to me? She says that no matter what happens between her and JC she and I will always be friends and I really want that to be true. I would hate to loose her friendship.\n\nSo that's where I am. Thank you all for listening! I am hoping for some more good feedback!\n\nI think you should try to just take this one day at a time, and try to communicate your feelings to JC and Bee, even if it feels weird or uncomfortable. Relationships tend to change over time, but very often the change is for the good, so try to keep that positive thought in mind. You, Bee, and JC may grow closer because of this, who knows.\n\nJust think how Bee feels when JC can't be with her ... Long-Distance Relationships can be a rough road to travel. Empathizing will probably help you feel less threatened (or left out).\n\nAnyway, I'm glad you joined us on our website.\nSincerely,\nKevin T.\n\n__________________ Love means never having to say, \"Put down that meat cleaver!\"\n\nKevin,\nThanks for your advice. I do really understand how hard it is for Bee. And i think about that a lot. She and I had a long talk today about our feelings. She was concerned that I might be feeling anxious and was very open to listening to my feelings. We tallked about her concerns too so it was a mutual conversation, not one sided.\n\nI am trying to use this as a growing experience for me. I am secure in my relationship, but this is uncharted waters for me. I know that most of my feelings are tied up in being out of my comfort zone. This will be a good thing for me regardless of the outcome.\n\nAt this point I don't know why I accepted the idea of polyamory. Why I let JC have a relationship with Bee. Was it because I am poly or was it because that is what JC wants.\n\nI think my biggest fear is that after this is trist is over I'll realize that the poly life isn't for me. I know that if I choose not to be poly I will either have to learn to tolerate his other lovers or loose our marriage. And that is a tough pill to swallow. JC and I have already discussed this issue and he has made it clear that he loves me and doesn't want to be without me. But if I am not comfortable with his polyness, then it will eventually split us apart. he says that he has lived without being open about who he is long enough and doesn't want to go back to being mono. He is okay if I want to stay mono.\n\ni don't want to change him. but I need to be true to myself. But first I need to figure out what will make me happy with or without JC.\n\nWell, you certainly have some tough soul-searching to do on the road ahead. It says a lot for you that you're not trying to change (or dictate) JC, you're just trying to figure out what you should do about the situation for you.\n\nWhatever you decide, take your time about deciding it. Sometimes we experience something that at first seems impossible, like we just can't do it ... but then later on, we find that it unexpectedly becomes more manageable for us. You may find that you have more strength for this situation than you thought you had.\n\nRe:\n\nQuote:\n\n\"At this point I don't know why I accepted the idea of polyamory. Why I let JC have a relationship with Bee. Was it because I am poly or was it because that is what JC wants?\"\n\nWell that's certainly something to think about, and interesting questions. Just remember that however you got here, you now know that it is something JC wants. You have to figure out whether you can live with that part of his nature. If you can't, then it will come down to, either he'd have to change (and break up with Bee), or you'd have to break up with him. None of the paths you can go on are easy paths. So as I said, don't be in a rush to decide anything. Give yourself some time to maybe acclimatize to this new kind of situation.\n\nThink about what you will need to get you through this impending trip that JC is going on. Will you need him to contact you very often? Are there things you can do (friends to see, hobbies to work on, etc.) that would help take your mind off of some of the fears and loneliness? What else could be done that would make this a little easier?\n\nI hope things work out okay.\nKevin\n\n__________________ Love means never having to say, \"Put down that meat cleaver!\"\n\nI spoke to JC about my feelings and he was very concerned. He was afraid he was going to come home to a divorce. After I let him know that I wasn't going to divorce him so quickly after 15 years of marriage and 2 kids he calmed down and really listened to my feelings. I let him know that these were personal things I needed to deal with. not something I needed him to fix, but support me as I travel this path.\n\nWell, he left yesterday morning. As I watched him pack, I got excited thinking about them meeting for the first time. I was able to use that NRE to my advantage! I thought about what they would be wearing and I could see the smiles on their faces and it made me happy!\n\nLater that night I called JC to check in with him. He wasn't supposed to meet Bee until today so I wasn't worried about interrupting them. So he says \"would you be upset if I told you that we already had sex?\" He has never been one for beating around the bush or subtly! After I got over the initial shock, I realized that I was more than okay with it. Not upset at all! I know then that all my fears were unfounded and all was well. I texted Bee later that night just to let her know that I was okay with her relationship with JC and our friendship was still in tact! That weren't with each other during the day today so I was able to text/call both without feeling like intruding. they are together now and I am trying to be patient, but I can't wait to hear how the evening went!", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "b6aa4d2b-6249-4db0-a962-d1723d0fe631", "url": "http://www.polyamory.com/forum/showthread.php?t=25636"}
{"text": "United Parcel Service (UPS: Quote), the world's largest package delivery company, said Thursday that its board has declared a 8.8 percent increase regular quarterly dividend, and also raised its share repurchase authorization to $10 billion.\n\nThe company noted that its dividend has more than tripled since 2000, with cash dividends being either increased or maintained every year for more than four decades.\n\nThe Atlanta, Georgia-based company's board raised its regular quarterly dividend on all outstanding Class A and Class B shares by 8.8 percent to $0.62 per share from $0.57 per share, and is payable on March 12 to shareholders of record as on February 25, 2013.\n\n\"This dividend increase reflects the power of the UPS business model to deliver consistent returns to shareowners. During 2012 we generated almost $5.4 billion in free cash flow, enabling reinvestment for growth and greater shareowner distributions, which are a top priority at UPS,\" Chairman and CEO Scott Davis said in a statement.\n\nFurther, the company also said the board has reauthorized its share repurchase program and raised the authorization to $10 billion, with no expiration date.\n\nThe boosted share repurchase authorization replaces the earlier $5 billion stock repurchase authorization on May 2012, which had no expiration date and replaced the one originally announced in 2008.\n\nThe company also said in May that it plans to repurchases of $1.5 billion in 2012, and expected the same level of activity in 2013. However, it raised its share repurchase guidance for 2013 to $4.0 billion on January 31, 2013.\n\nThe raise in dividend and the boosted share repurchase program can be seen as an action to provide shareholders with some value after UPS' agreed $6.8 billion acquisition of Dutch rival TNT Express N.V. (TNTEF, TNTEY) was shelved on January 30 after the European Commission formally prohibited the proposed deal, citing competitive concerns. The two firms announced the deal in March 2012, when UPS agreed to buy the TNT Express for a sweetened offer of 9.50 euros per share.\n\nAdditionally, the company announced that John Thompson, CEO of Virtual Instruments Corp. and the former Chairman and CEO of Symantec Corp.

{"text": " that you want from us?\n\nIf you're a reader of the Community Crier, some of this might look a little familiar, but cutting and pasting saved me 5 minutes of typing, which is invaluable right now because there is so much going on over here that I'm flat out.\n\nIn those immortal words of Bob Dylan, The times they are a-changin'. They perhaps apply more here in the SitePoint community than ever before. February saw the departure of a couple of special people over at the forums, and March dawned with the introduction of ... me.\n\nAfter approximately 9 years (it's too long for anyone to actually remember) we said farewell to Sarah as Administrator. At the same time, Raena left her role as Community Manager. Those ladies are leaving rather a big hole to fill and I'm hoping I haven't bitten off more than I can chew!\n\nWhile we're on the subject of change, the first task I'm going to attempt in my new role is a change of 'energy' here. The staff here have spent the last year or so working their butts off to get the spammers and 'fluff' posters under control and now it's time to start channeling our energy into making this place somewhere a bit more stimulating! We have a few activities on the go behind the scenes and it won't be long until you guys start reaping the benefits.\n\nI'd really like to hear what it is that you'd like out of these forums. If you've been gone for a while, what can we do to entice you back? If you're relatively new, what is it that you do or don't like about this place? If you're an old faithful - thanks, we love you guys and it's always good to hear from you.\n\nOne of the things I will give sitepoint credit for is their approach to criticism.\n\nI have on 2 occasions not liked 2 of their books and I have really given them some stick over it when on the forums and to my surprise all my feedback, however harsh has always been displayed. I have to commend sitepoint on that It also became apparent to me that the forums were not being moderated efficiently as some of the posts are clearly pointless and some users really need penalising/removing.\n\nI did post something recently on the forum and I got the same thing back again so I stopped using them again and started using webdesignersforum instead. With them its clear that that forum is monitored more closely and time wasters are quickly removed.\n\nAccording to Mythbusters, this implies Sarah has hit the ground stumbling uncontrollably. Hopefully she can look beyond that and get the essence of what you said...\n\nOn a more serious note, one thing I've noticed with Sitepoint is that it's home to a lot of noobs which stimulates unintelligent discussions. Sure, everyone has to start somewhere and I don't mind helping these people who are still in the midst of understanding core concepts, but it would be good if somehow sitepoint could promote higher quality discussions. The \"Application Design\" sub-forum of PHP is a good example of higher quality discussion. That's all really I'd like to see changed at sitepoint.

So I guess more answers to my questions atop the Google results will get me to the forum more often.\n\nAlthough I can add that I usually don't post questions in forums, in general, because of experiences in the past where I either never receive an answer, get a rude what are you stupid response or my question is time sensitive and I can't wait a day for the first reply. But that's true of all forums and Google is usually immediate satisfaction as long as you ask the right question....but I do post as a last resort.\n\nI do like to help out and answer posts myself from time to time too...but never have time lately.\n\nOther then the forum I follow sitepoint tweets and love the articles and blogs on sitepoint. I bought the web design business kit and it was awesome...saving up for the web marketing kit next.\n\nI only came to the forums late last year at the invite of Raena, and simply don't have the time I'd like to dedicate to spending more time here.\nI'm excited to see what you've got planned with this place Hawk\n\nThanks for the email Sarah. I will be coming back for a whole lot of information all the time.\n\nMy main thing is learning how to actually create a website then also include a back end onto it so clients can manage certain parts of the website i specify. (CMS) not using drupal joomla or anything.\n\nBut yeah im always on the look out for that information would be good if sitepoint offers this information in a book as i have bought SIMPLY SQL and Build your own database driven website using PHP and MYSQL. and a lot of other books but them two regarding databases\n\njust busy, doing scrum on a project that doesn't really get folllowed. having a boss as the project owner doesnt make it easy at all.and, how about adding a new subsection under javascript \"jQuery, mootootle etc\".\n\nIf you won't dress like the\nVictoria Secret girls,\ndon't expect us to act like soap opera guys\n\nIt's not the reason of my absence but that annoys me too. I have seen many times that a users reply is just one line (or rather 4/5 words) but their signature is about 4/5 lines with 2/3 colors ...\n\nI will like to see some new rules regarding that.\n\nI have been a silent reader for all those years but I will try to be around more often.\n\nSorry guys and girls I havent been around much this has mailnly been due to being really busy with rebuilding our mainsite that goes live in two week, buying another site and comming to terms with the recent Google update which impacted on us more than most sites, due to the fact we had lots of high quality links from high PR sites but in real terms a shortage of links. Things seem to be\n\nAnyway be around a bit more at the end of the month when our new site goes live.\n\nIn answer to the main question more analysis and threads about Google updates and what there doing would be goodThis would be a great feature to have! Especially when a new member answer conflicts with a more experienced forum member post as I feel it can be a little hard to get your voice heard if you haven't been posting here for a long time.\n\nI've been reading these forums for a good year or so and have recently began posting. Its great for keeping up with the latest standards and tech and is pretty much my goto site if I have a few spare minutes at work\n\nWhen I come here I have the /forums/ bookmarked, the first thing I notice are the Featured Posts. Usually I don't have anything to say but I'm curious about what's being said, so If there is anything interesting featured that's what I look for. I think you should try to feature more than 1 a day if possible, or if anything interesting was said.\n\nI don't come on as much as I used to because I am working a lot more, I think that's the story with a lot of people. I like the forums a lot still and I think the staff here is better than any other forum I had in the past.\n\nActually I don't read the Articles here much, It would be nice if you Featured a Post about an Article on SP, or just a Post about Industry news. I know a few articles are very feature rich so they are worthwhile to read I just never scope that page much since Im fixed to the forums and a perma-bookmark.\n\nThanks for inviting me back. Being an amateur I found sometimes it is not easy to have an opinion on my changes as I should do special reviews and so on. Perhaps you can ease that requirement? Anyway thanks so much for being there as a wonderful source of info.\n\nI have to say, I find that Sitepoint is a great place for resources. And the greatest resource on the internet is a forum. To be honest, Ive always found the layout of these forums, too intense and heavy, slow, and has been a major deterrant from me being active.\n\nTo hear that your moving to vBulletin is great news.

A #1! 5 Star!\nWhat a beautiful place! As soon as you walk in, the first thing that I noticed was how clean it was. The place is immaculate. The furnishings, the decorations, fit the victorian style. This was a home away from home.\nThe breakfasts were awesome, and very heathly, as well as getting us off to a very nice start for the day. Rona and Skip were very hospitable, pleasant to talk to, and extemely helpful in guiding us where to visit, tour, and eat. Another thing that made Brittas Bed and Breakfast so great, is the fact that you can park your car and walk 8 minutes to the restuarants, shops, and waterfront. The bed was so snuggly and comfortable, and the bedroom was cozy and big. There is a nice separate sitting room where you can watch TV, and drink some wine, or you can watch TV in your bedroom, or even sit downstairs in the cozy living room by the fire place. Don't miss the views of the backyard. I could go on and on about how nice this place is, how close it is for walking distance to everything, the hospitality of Rona and Skip, the superb breakfasts, and just the cozyness of the bed and breakfast. Definitely a 5 star place, and compared to the Cannery Pier Hotel and the others around Astoria, the price for a one night stay is far far less than what you would pay to stay at other hotels, and you get the 5 star luxary with the stay at Brittas Bed and Breakfast.\n\nBritta's Inn was a beautiful home in the four-square tradition architecture. The garden in the back yard was breathtaking. The dog was adorable. Accommodations were more than what we needed for sure. We highly recommend this Inn in Astoria.\n\nAfter researching over 25 bed and breakfasts along the Oregon Coast, I decided to take a chance with Britta's Inn, atop a hillside, overlooking the Columbia River. It was a mother and daughter week vacation that turned out to be the most magical and enchanting vacation we've ever had thanks to Skip and Rona- the lovely host and hostess. The Queen room was elegant and supremely clean with the delicate touch of flowers from Rona's garden and a fresh supply of chocolates and spring water that were refreshing after a day of festivities in Astoria. Rona went to great lengths to have organic and fresh fruit each morning along with her delectable and healthy breakfasts that were varied the entire week we stayed. Rona was very accommodating and asked us if we had any special needs. Never before have I been to a bed and breakfast that was as conscientious of food quality and selection. Her breakfasts were to die for. Rona and Skip were such a pleasure to be around, we found ourselves wanting to spend more time at the Inn instead of going out. What a wonderful surprise! You can bet we will be staying again.\n\nWe only had one night at Britta's Inn, but felt immediately at home. Though we didn't get to meet Skip, Rona was a delight. The decor was beautiful, interesting, and tasteful. Our room was one of the prettiest we ever stayed in. They focus on high end mattresses, so our sleep was restful. The food was delicious. We would definitely return. Highly recommended!\n\nBritt's Inn set itself apart from other B&Bs I've visited. It is not a cluttered old fashioned house, it is a beautifully restored and decorated Craftsman up on the hill with amazing views but still an easy walk to downtown Astoria. Breakfast is also an exception to typically Inn breakfasts. Rona has many offerings and will cook something based on your preferences. The rooms, and especially the beds are amazingly comfortable. I have visited twice and will do so again.\n\nOur stay at Britta�s Inn was fantastic! Rona and Skip are wonderful hosts and do a great job of creating a warm and inviting space to relax in. This delightful bed and breakfast is nestled in a beautiful area of Astoria within walking distance to local shops and restaurants. Breakfast is something worth waking up for! The aroma of fresh-brewed coffee summons you down for a delicious organic breakfast made for you by Rona. My personal favorites were her heavenly Swedish pancakes. We look forward to a return visit soon.\n\nWe traveled from Florida and spent 5 days at the Inn. This was our first experience staying at a B&B and now we are spoiled. Britta's definitely set the bar high. It is such a peaceful and tranquil place to stay on the Oregon Coast. Rona and Skip are exceptional hosts. We are looking forward to visiting them again.", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "fc0644d8-4531-4333-be41-4bbed364dfc4", "url": "http://travel.yahoo.com/p-hotel-14824914-britta_s_inn_bed_and_breakfast-i"}

{"text": "EDIT Many people are telling me that the photo reminds them of the monster from Pan's Labyrinth, and I agree. I am a fan of this movie, but it wasn't my inspiration for this photo.Maybe it was subconsciously. Anyway, I really like FATM's songs, their music has an impact on me. I always found this particular song interesting and it made my imagination run wild. So this is my way of depicting this mysterious \"girl with one eye\".\n\nHey, I'm not a pro photographer, just a beginner, but here is my opinion\n\nI like your idea here, still i dont feel confortable with the right eye (the one from the model, not the one on the hand) Either we see it too much, or not enough. IE i would either change the model posture to have it fully visible, or i would either have to move her hand a bit to her right to have it totally hidden ( you could either done it to totally hide either)\n\nFirst of all, I'd like to say how much I love this picture and how original it is! The idea is great, especially being inspired by music, and the execution is fantastic! It immediately caught my eye, and I must confess, when I looked a little closer, I had to look twice. When I realized (yeah I'm not a quick understander) that the eye was actually painted on the hand, I was amazed. Such skills, not only in photography but also in drawing!\n\nThe colours are beautiful, not extreme or intense, yet very calming and perfectly suitable for the concept. Composition and light are wonderful too, nothing that could be done differently actually. Overall just a stunning photograph that you should be extremely proud of!\n\nI'm sorry, this should be a critique.

But when I saw him, you know I walked out first, but then I was like nah I have to, I have to say something to him,\" Budden explained in an interview. \"I just wanted to have a conversation with him, face to face about anything that him or his significant other wanted to address to me.

Budden called out Cons for talking slick about him behind his back, while Consequence fumbled his way out of a potential altercation (thankfully things didn't get physical, though) and blamed his interviewers and Raqi Thunda for instigating.

In Star Trek: Into Darkness, he was the terroristic villain, John Harrison. In The Fifth Estate, he brilliantly impersonated Julian Assange, so thick-tongued, charmless, but compelling. In the Oscar-cert 12 Years a Slave (out here on January 10), he is tremendous as the relatively benevolent slave-owner, Ford. And he also crops up as the family failure, Little Charles, in the Tracy Letts melodrama, August: Osage County (out January 17), being acted off the screen like everybody else by Meryl Streep, going right over the top.\n\nFor much of his career, Cumberbatch has specialised in outsiders, from his first lead television role as Stephen Hawking onwards. But it was his debut as the ultimate outsider Sherlock, in July 2010, that made him an idol, so desired. The Cumberbitches fancy him rotten, you see. But others don't get it, possibly including the man himself, who polls as \"number one sexiest male movie star\" in many such lists, the latest in Empire magazine. He's always been remarkably deprecatory about his own looks, often lamenting that he's not as handsome as his pal James McAvoy.\n\n\"This face. It's kind of long. Horse. Not as in 'rah!' but as in equestrian…\" Cumberbatch said of himself in one interview. In another, told just how enthusiastically the Cumberbitches were tweeting about him, he observed: \"It seems girls are really going for my Shergar looks.\"\n\nHe has also acknowledged his similarity to a cartoon sloth. Asked what he most disliked about his appearance, he replied: \"The size and shape of my head. I've been likened to Sid from Ice Age.\" Sid's a chinless wonder, his head a triangle demarcated by his mouth and eyes.\n\nOnline, Cumberbatch's face has been very funnily demonstrated to resemble that of an otter. Even this our hero manages to find funny: \"Who knew that a wet amphibious creature could bear such a resemblance to the number one consulting detective — but you've got it, it's evidence.\"\n\nIn my own film reviews, I see that I have said his looks have \"that crucial touch of lizard\". Now he's embraced that identity in his great turn in The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug (in cinemas today) in which he plays the awesome, gloating dragon, not just voicing the part (it's a talkative monster) but also acting it out for preliminary motion capture. \"It was important for me to physicalise his voice, to inhabit his movements a little bit — you can see little bits of my movements and little bits of my face,\" Cumberbatch has said.\n\nIt's true too — this may be a full-blown, flapping and scaly saurian, breathing fire, but look closely, think Benedict and suddenly you can see it's nothing but a grandiose elaboration of the hottie du jour, playing to his strengths.\n\nBut it's not this role that's made him the hottest of the hot, though. Nor The Fifth Estate, which has been the flop of the year, according to financial magazine Forbes — returning just $6 million of its $28 million budget, and scoring the worst opening weekend for any major film in 2013. Maybe everybody in the media overestimated the public interest in seeing WikiLeaks become a movie. Then again, not even Cumberbitches could easily fancy Cumberbatch as Assange.\n\nNo, it is Sherlock — with his intelligence, his speed, his asocial impatience and contemptuous masterfulness — that is idolised by Cumberbatch devotees. He seems to know that himself, to his credit. Interviewed at a premiere about being voted the hottest hottie yet again, he admitted first: \"I spent a long time not being the sexiest man on anyone's list!\" Then: \"I think this is to do with stuff I'm doing as an actor, rather than what I actually look like, so I'm flattered on that level, I suppose.\"\n\nHe often wistfully remarks that being Sherlock is \"an achievable superpower\" — you can be observant and make intelligent deductions, whereas you can't fly through the air or unleash fireballs. If it were so, Sherlock wouldn't still stand alone, though. And what Cumberbatch crucially brought to the role, apart from a natural fit between his own jittery intelligence and almost alien looks (as the co-scriptwriter Mark Gatiss has noted), was youth. At 35, he was simply much more youthful than Sherlock had become accepted to be over the years.\n\nWith luck, he has many more series ahead of him. Will he ever find another part to touch it? Maybe. It looks like he's going to play Hamlet in the West End next year — and Hamlet's always had a touch of Sherlock about him (or is it the other way about?). In the meantime, the bitches are holding on for The Empty Hearse. In the trailer, Sherlock says he'll surprise Watson — \"pop into Baker Street, who knows, pop out of a cake?\" \"Baker Street? It isn't there any more, he's got on with his life,\" Mycroft tells him. \"What life?\" Sherlock sneers. \"I've been away.\" The CBs know the feeling.\n\nHail the return of the great detective\n\nSpoiler alert: he's alive. Two years ago fans saw Benedict Cumberbatch's triumphantly reimagined, 21st-century version of Conan Doyle's detective jump off a hospital roof, apparently outwitted in death by arch-enemy Moriarty and watched by Martin Freeman's horrified Dr Watson. Unlike, say, Taggart, it was always going to be a question of how, rather than if, Sherlock survived. Fortunately, I don't need to worry about wrecking season three's biggest reveal because writer and co-creator Mark Gatiss simply declines to solve the mystery of Sherlock's escape. He has a lot of fun toying with the theories that have been batting around the ether in the past 24 months, though, including some of the raunchier fan-fiction.\n\nMost of the first 90-minute episode, previewed at the BFI yesterday and to be screened on New Year's Day, concentrates on rebuilding the complex, interdependent relationship of Cumberbatch's swaggeringly impatient genius and Freeman's exasperated Everyman. Watson, initially as traumatised by his friend's death as he once was by his injuries from Afghanistan, has moved on and acquired a moustache and a fiancée: housekeeper Mrs Hudson blithely assumes he's marrying a man. When Sherlock reappears in person — the wider news breaks on Twitter — Watson's reaction is combative. It's his intended, Mary (played by Freeman's real-life partner Amanda Abbington, nice touch), who coaxes them back together.\n\nI can't spoil the rest of the plot, as there isn't much of it beyond some teasing set-up scenarios involving terrorism, fire, hectic chases across and under London, and a tantalising glimpse of Sherlock's background. This opening film of three defiantly asks more questions than it answers but is no less entertaining, hectic and clever for that. It's knowingly funny, and pacily directed by Jeremy Lovering. Cumberbatch performs Sherlock's snap deductions with brio and hints at a new vulnerability in the character.\n\nBut there is also — whisper it — a slight hint of the self-satisfaction that seeps into all very successful TV series trying to keep the quality up. It probably doesn't help that Cumberbatch and Freeman have become international movie stars since they were last seen at 221B Baker Street. Hopefully this will vanish once the plot takes proper grip in episode two. How nice, though, to live in a time of such televisual riches that the slightest chance of Sherlock going even slightly off the boil is cause for concern. Truly, it's good to have him back.", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "0076dc11-c023-4976-b4a5-38a3258ee5ad", "url": "http://www.standard.co.uk/lifestyle/london-life/for-some-christmas-is-all-about-christ-for-some-its-santa-claus-but-for-others-this-year-its-all-about-benedict-cumberbatch-9007428.html"}

{"text": "Posted on 26 June, 2014\n\nThe fist-pump. As far as sporting celebrations go it's one of the more understated. But thanks to its liberal and emphatic use over the years by the likes of Nadal, Sharapova, Murray and even 'Tiger' Tim Henman it has become the de facto gesture of accomplishment in world tennis, employed by everyone to celebrate a point, game, set or match won.\n\nNow, however, the humble fist-pump has entered the annals of sporting history for another reason entirely: it's the first celebration in any sport, in any part of the world, to become the subject of its own sponsorship deal.\n\nIndeed, this week we made our client Three the official fist-pumpsponsor of British No. 5 tennis player, and Wimbledon hopeful, Tara Moore. Not only did it represent the first time that a hand gesture has been sponsored, it was also the first time in the history of sport that a professional player's limb was the subject of a commercial deal.\n\nAdditionally, every time Tara, 21, fist-pumped during a match at Wimbledon, Three donated money to the charity Rally For Bally, set up in memory of Elena Baltacha. And although Tara came agonisingly close to making it to the second round, her valiant efforts have seen £3,921 raised for charity.\n\nThe world's first fist-pump sponsorship was arranged to announce LG's new flagship G3 smartphone becoming available on Three. Among its many groundbreaking technological feats, the new G3 device features an innovative front-facing 'selfie' camera that is activated by clenching one's hand into a shape much like the classic fist-pump.\n\nTara's sponsorship became the talk of SW19, and just as Tara fist pumped for every point won, so did we for each piece of coverage secured, with over 50 articles generated in the space of 48 hours, including HUGE pieces in the Daily Mail (twice), The Times, Guardian (twice), Daily Star (twice), Metro, Sun, Daily Mirror,Mirror.co.uk, Mail online, dailystar.co.uk, guardian.co.uk, Mail online again, Eurosportand many, many more – all of which were topped off by a rather nice post-match interview with Tara on BBC1.\n\nPosted on 23 June, 2014\n\nAs countless jet setting celebs have proven over the years, if you want to turn heads at the airport there's few better ways than to strut around unashamedly with trolley-loads of excess baggage in tow. But now there's a completely new kind of shameless suitcase statement for travellers to make – and it has been tailored specifically to today's generation of sun-seeking social media show-offs.\n\nSaid suitcase statement takes the form of the world's first-ever 'braggie' suitcases, which we created for our lovely new client Three. The in-your-face suitcases give the selfie-obsessed the chance to have their favourite holiday selfies, belfies, 'hot dog legs', poolside poses, plane wing pictures and sunset snaps splashed all over their luggage to wheel around the airports and hotels brazenly this summer.\n\nWe gave the nation its first glance of the braggie suitcases by holding a glamorous photo shoot with serial social media travel bragger Kelly Brook… and a private jet. Brook, 34, effortlessly breezed through the airport with a matching luxury suitcase set adorned with her favourite holiday pictures of, erm, herself.\n\nThe story of Kelly Brook and the world's first selfie suitcases cleaned up in the media with not one but FOUR articles on the Mail Online (here, here, here and here), as well as a full page in the Daily Star and equally big write ups on the Daily Star online, Mirror online, OK! online, Metro, Handbag.com and Good Morning America.\n\nThe braggie suitcases were launched as part of Three's new #HolidayBraggie competition, which is encouraging people to send in their best holiday brag to be in with a chance of winning a holiday to one of Three's 16 Feel At Home destinations – not to mention a personalised braggie suitcase to travel there and back again with.\n\nPosted on 4 June, 2014\n\nYou've all read about 'The Most Important Meals of Their Lives 25 page recipe e-book' for Send A Cow, right?

{"text": "Preview of Miami ND – The Debate – Week 5 RecapLast week showed encouraging results. Washington won on Thursday, but Hawaii's pathetic showing on Friday halted my progress. I went 6-5 on Saturday so overall the weekend was a success. My overall record is now back to even on the year, 35-35-2. The pride and joy of my statistics is my 31-25 record on Saturdays. Arizona fell just short in the final minutes on Sunday morning, dropping my Pac 12 record to an incredible 2-9-1. I have yet to win a game involving a team from Utah, but that 0-6 streak could be broken Thursday night. USC plays at Utah so something has to give. I give my two picks later in the post – Arkansas State and the Utes.\nThis week features two marquee events that I am very excited about: The First Presidential Debate Wednesday night and Miami vs Notre Dame on Saturday night in Chicago. After a detailed review of both, I discovered how many similarities could be drawn. I will preview both and explain why Mitt Romney represents Miami and Barack Obama represents Notre Dame.\nphoto credit: media.cmgdigital.com\nWhile both events could result in dramatic changes to daily life in America, they may be overlooked due to pop culture. Too many television viewers on Wednesday night will be drawn to reruns of Keeping Up With the Kardashians, Storage Wars, or Rehab with Dr. Drew. On Saturday night, most Americans will probably be enjoying a night at the movie theatre to watch Liam Neeson take care of business in Taken 2.\nBoth Obama and Notre Dame are significant favorites in the events this week. According to a poll this week from Quinnipiac University, two thirds of voters expect Obama to perform better than Romney in the debate. Notre Dame is currently a thirteen-point favorite for Saturday's game and seemingly everyone has already decided that the Irish will win convincingly. The underdogs hope that the inflated expectations will result in overconfidence this week, which could be a factor in both events.\nBoth Obama and Notre Dame are championed by an old man prone to misspeaking – Joe Biden and Lou Holtz.\nBoth Obama and Notre Dame are extremely popular, both in this country and abroad. They are flashy and demand media attention in everything they do. Notre Dame's NBC contract and the amazing terms of the deal with the ACC finalized this year, reaffirms the status of the Irish. Obama and the Irish draw substantial crowds in Europe – as judged by Obama's European tour in 2008 and ND's successful game in Ireland last month.\nBoth Obama and Notre Dame relied on experienced performers when a spark was required at a critical time. Bill Clinton's speech at the DNC was one of the highlights of the Obama 2012 campaign and Clinton's continued involvement has been vital. When Coach Brian Kelly needed a game winning drive against Purdue, he turned to veteran QB Tommy Rees. His decision was a stroke of genius, as Rees led ND to the win. Rees led the only touchdown drive against Michigan as well.\nBoth Romney and Miami have relied on a youth movement to inject energy into the program. Mitt chose Paul Ryan as his VP candidate and helped put crucial Midwestern states back into undecided territory. Miami has relied on 9 new starters on offense to win games in the fourth quarter, with many of the contributors being true freshmen.\nBoth Romney and Miami were extremely successful in the 80's and 90's, but struggled to maintain that success in the mid 2000's. Romney's embarrassing loss in the Republican primary in 2008 mirrors the experience of the Canes under Randy Shannon.\nRomney and Miami are disliked because of past successes. Romney's experience at Bain continues to be an issue that is attacked by his opponent, while Miami suffers from negative recruiting stemming from the Nevin Shapiro scandal. Image is a critical weakness for both, with Romney trying to avoid the characterization of a wealthy man out of touch with average Americans. Miami is still struggling to shake the Catholics vs Convicts image from the 1980's, despite the impressive efforts of recent coaching staffs to clean up the program.\nBoth Romney and Miami were written off earlier in September after seemingly fatal missteps. Miami was crushed 52-13 by Kansas State and the media proudly mocked what was sure to be another down year for the Hurricanes. Miami flew home from Manhattan and never looked back, winning three straight games and building momentum. Mitt was videotaped talking about the now infamous 47% of Americans that don't pay federal income taxes. Many figured this comment doomed his campaign, but while the polls still indicate an Obama lead, the race is far from over.\nI will be resuming my college football odyssey this weekend as I'm headed to Chicago for the game. Soldier Field will be a terrific atmosphere and I hope the Canes don't have trouble dealing with cold weather. With temperatures expected to be in the 40s, Miami better get off to a good start early to keep the adrenaline flowing.\nArkansas State +1 at FIU THURSDAY – ESPNU – 730pm\nWhen he led Cam Newton and Auburn to a national title in 2010, I supported Gus Malzahn on every occasion. It's time for Gus to lead me to a victory again. His Arkansas State team has faced very tough competition this season, losing to Nebraska and Oregon. FIU has faced a far softer schedule and the Golden Panthers come into this matchup at 1-4. FIU's defense has been one of the nation's worst – a recipe for disaster against the experience of Ark State QB Ryan Aplin. The Red Wolves have a balanced offensive attack and Gus will be pushing all the right buttons on Thursday night. Given FIU's season thus far, the home crowd will offer little advantage. The Sun Belt has always been good to me – Ark State wins by 10.\nUSC at Utah +14 THURSDAY – ESPN – 9pm\nThis game features world's colliding. Will I end my losing streak in Utah? Will my Pac 12 fortunes turn around? I realize that by picking Utah, I am significantly increasing Lane Kiffin's chances of success. While that troubles me, I have to stick with my gut and take the Utes to play well at home. Utah is a bipolar team that has been plagued by turnovers. Kyle Whittingham's teams always play well following a loss and the embarrassing game at Arizona State will prove as motivation for his team. A national audience provides the Utes with an opportunity to make a statement that they will be a factor in the conference race this season. USC bounced back from the Stanford loss with a win against Cal, but the Trojans haven't really been impressive at any point in 2012. QB Matt Barkley will be blitzed often and his shaky offensive line will be tested. USC wins behind the talent of skill players on the edges, but it won't be easy. Utah keeps it close heading into the 4th quarter. \"It's absolutely essential that we respond,\" Utah coach Kyle Whittingham told the school's official website. \"We are probably playing the most talented team in the conference in USC. We find out what we're made of this week and what kind of resiliency we have.\"\nBeyondU Sports\nBeyondU Sports - Best College Sports Blog Site\n\nPresident Barack Obama is a secret admirer of golf, he plays any chance he can get and at last count he has played 104 full 18 hole rounds of golf in his four years in office.

{"text": "There is only one success--to be able to spend your life in your own way.\nChristopher Morley\n\nMonday, January 26, 2009\n\nThoughts\n\nShayla and I with our new \"podium wear\"..\n\nGood Afternoon!\n\nSo this is the post that I really didn't want to write.\n\nI spent the last eight days trying to push thoughts away, and trying to make a bit of sense of what I'm feeling.\n\nI wish I was posting that I made the World Championships team. I didn't. Instead I was going to write a post that was hopefully motivating and listed off the things that I did wrong and try to put a positive spin on things. There were some things that went well, but really when I look at it from a numbers point of view which is definetly not the most delicate way to look at things. Simply put I wasn't fast enough.\n\nI know, I'm really setting quite the tone for this post, but really thats all I can come up with. I didn't ski tough enough and I couldn't focus enough to fight to get where I needed to be. My body has been recovering quite well from everything this year. I haven't been sick and I've been consistent. All positives, but I haven't been able to go from good to great. I don't think I'm missing an extra 4th or 5th or 6th gear, I've made the finals in ever skate sprint this year. I also don't think I'm lacking endurance or fitness.\n\nBasically I race to fitness which is what gets you in the mix, but it NEVER will make you a winner, it won't allow you to have that extraordinary day where you can't wipe the grin off your face. Racing to fitness puts you in a comfortable place where you almost always know you could have dug deeper.\n\nWow, this is getting more negative as I go.\n\nIn the state of confusion and sadness I have toyed with the idea of quitting- its not \"stopping\" or \"bowing out\" and when I spoke with one of my best friends about this his answer was the question \" are you wanting to quit because you gave it your all and there are still faster skiiers in front of you or are you quitting because you don't love the sport anymore?\". Ahhhh, interesting, it posed a bit of a dilemma in my point blank decision to quit.\n\nI'm still thinking about the answer- I know what your thinking...if you loved it then the answer would be quick. But that is not always true. Sometimes the things you love the most are also what cause the greatest heartache!\n\nAll I know is that I am close, so very close and perhaps thats why it hurts the most. I wanted it to be now. I think about the hours of training this summer, the waivering in belief (which may have been what harmed me the most) and well it is overwhelming to think of putting in another summer.\n\nThe one positive I will take from this is that I have trained fulltime now for two years and I've made it this far, then what would happen if I added another year to the mix? Its not sacrifice, there is nothing that I have sacrificed. I love my life as an athlete, but I find the road to success quite stressful and I don't deal with it well. I tend to heap so much pressure onto myself that I drag this huge back pack (along with matching suitcase, ski bag, duffle bag and purse) around the course with me. If for once I could push it all aside and just ski for the pure joy of wanting to be the best athlete I can on any given day would probabley result in the accomplishment of goals I have set. So until I can check this baggage I know I will be on layover for a while.\n\nIt is frustrating, there is no easy way to deal with it. If I want to fix it, I have so much work to do- and none of that work is physical. I just don't know if I am strong enough to sift through the baggage.\n\nI am fighting every thought to run away from this feeling, but I know that I have to fight it. Its not really about skiing anymore, its about becoming a stronger, tougher person and its a little scary right now.\n\nThank you to all those who cheered me on at the trials and world cups and thanks to those who have provided advice, hugs and a shoulder to cry on.\n\nThe cool part is that all those who were selected (namely Shayla and Chris) must be on cloud nine because the exact opposite of what I'm feeling is complete elation- so I am pretty excited for them. It just echos even more that you need to believe in yourself no matter what, and I haven't really nailed that down yet.\n\nI don't know where I'm off to next. I think I will be heading to Vermont for a Super tour and then to New Hampshire or to do the American Birkie. We also have Western Canadian Champs here in Canmore, but yeah, its a little hard to get amped when you want to be racing world cup wearing your National team suit.\n\nLINKS\n\n24 Hour Relay Champs 2008\n\nAbout Me\n\n- Go Hard or Go Home\n- Love what you do\n- Live in the moment\n- Believe in yourself\n- Test yourself everyday\n- Treat others how you would like to be treated.\n- Eat something sweet once a week\n- Do something that scares you once a day.", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "96458723-2c6a-4d32-8667-a9d987adbe1e", "url": "http://www.brookegosling.blogspot.com/2009/01/thoughts.html"}

{"text": "Blog Archives\n\nThis has nothing directly to do with my hit parade except that good singers don't use AutoTune. Today I heard something so ridiculous that my beard grew inwards by a few centimetres. Dark Metal Cat laughed so hard that he vomited on my desk.\n\nGet this… \"What's wrong with AutoTune? Why shouldn't singers use electronics to make their voices sound in tune? Your bands use electricity to make their guitars sound loud.\"\n\nIf you don't happen to know what AutoTune is, the Mammal Dictionary defines it as \"something that makes you vomit on your desk.\"\n\nI don't have a favourite genre of metal. The metal tree has branched profusely from the trunk that bore Sabbath's doom and Maiden's heavy metal. Just about every one of those branches has produced delicious fruit.\n\nI do listen more to some types of metal, though. Two of the styles that I love greatly are progressive and melodic death. When I was doing my manual bubble-sort of my best songs of the last 21 years, it just happened that the pair of songs that take their turn today are both melodic death, and both come from Sweden.\n\nI wonder how much of my bucket list I have completed at this point and should I worry about it now? Nah, 20 days to go until doomsday and today we have Arch Enemy's My Apocalypse representing. This song appears off the album Doomsday Machine which is highly appropriate given the nature of our impending doom.\n\nThis happens to be the album that got me into Arch Enemy to begin with. To this day, still my favorite album from them. What do you think of Amott leaving the band? Will he be jobless at the end of the world? Have a great day!\n\nI am not one to normally contemplate my astrology reading of the day. I do find them interesting at times and often accurate, but sometimes these things can be so vague that they apply to almost anyone. As we know, signs of the Zodiac are represented by symbols, elements, planets, and stones. Why not metal bands? If you know your sign, you should know what band applies to you. This is what my research for this theme of the week is going to do. No longer will you have to say you are Aries symbolized by the ram. Now, you can say I am Aries represented by Arch motherfucking Enemy. Here is my breakdown of what band should represent you and your astrological sign.\n\nThis year has been great for metal and I feel the best is yet to come later in the year, namely September 2011. Housebroken did a great job outlining his top-10 for the first half of 2011. Let's see how die-hard metal fans tastes compare and contrast. Here is my top 10 for 2011, January through June. I will keep this relatively short since I will be posting a full report on the Big Four sometime this weekend.\n\nWhat is your opinion of the standard thrash recipe? Do you think thrash as become weak over the years, stayed the same, got better, or a little bit of everything? Does thrash make you want to puke or snap your fingers…snap your neck? The theme for this week is going to focus on thrash from 2001-2010. Not so much the bands themselves, but the songs that define the music. I will cover the last 10 years with a few words on what's out in 2011 already. Part II of this theme is that all the songs I talk about fit onto one CD-R. If you like the tunes I picked it makes for a great mix.

No. 29/088,420, Filed May 22, 1998, now abandoned entitled Bird Feeder.\n\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\nThis invention relates generally to bird feeders, and more particularly to a bird feeder having a central fulcrum and carousel having multiple radially extending rotors, each carrying a bowl feeder station. The carousel turns on the central fulcrum in response to the out of balance weight shift of feeding birds as they move from station to station. In general, devices within the scope of the present invention include bird feeders that rotate freely about a central axis.\n\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\nIt is a major object of this invention to provide an attractive, whimsical, unpredictably sporadic, simple to assemble and use, bird feeding device that rotates in response to the out of balance weight, movement and momentum of feeding birds. Every component of the bird feeder device is custom designed to provide the aforementioned features. The majority of the components shown are molded from a UV resistant plastic and the support can be metal or plastic; however, it is conceivable that the components could be made out of any solid material such as wood, glass, metal, ceramic, cardboard, etc.\n\nThe device may be rotatably mounted through the use of a horizontal fulcrum or axle on any stationary object able to support the weight of the device when filled with bird feed and feeding birds. The device may be mounted indoors for the use of domesticated pet birds, or outdoors for wild birds. The vertical structural carousel of the feeder device turns about the horizontal fulcrum or axle, which is securely attached to a supporting structure. A household lubricant may be applied to reduce friction between the horizontal axle and the vertical structural carousel. Furthermore, a bearing may be added between the horizontal axle and the vertical structural carousel to further reduce friction. For example, a bronze oil-impregnated bearing can be pressed into the structural carousel's central bore during manufacture.\n\nA motor or wind could also drive this device. For example, a series of cogs could be mounted on the backside of the carousel. Alternatively, a rotating axle, pulley, or sheaves may be utilized. For wind drive, it is within the scope of my invention to add a sail to the roof or side of each unit. A sail having the configuration of a pinwheel would allow the feeder device to rotate when facing oncoming wind.\n\nThe diameter of the vertical structural carousel is rather small in relation to the entire feeder device, yet its perimeter provides sufficient surface area for the placement of multiple large, long length, radial-extending rotors. The vertical carousel, although plastic, is structurally designed to handle varying loads applied through the rotors due to the suspending, pulling, twisting, and turning forces encountered from environmental conditions as well as the birds and the feed in the feeder stations. The overall sweeping curved shape of the rotors not only provides intrinsic value but further, provides greatly enhanced structural support to counter act all foreseeable forces encountered, i.e.; suspending, pulling, twisting, and turning forces from environmental conditions, the birds, and the feed in the feed receptacles of the feeder stations. The long length of the rotors embellishes and enhances the movement induced to the invention by the loads and forces transmitted by the landing, perching and flying off of the birds.\n\nThe radial extending rotors each attach at their arcuate ends to complementary arcuate pockets on the structural carousel. Each of the radial extending rotors terminates with a distal end, which integrally contain an apertured support area. The aperture of each distal end is of a size and shape compatible to receive and co-axially support a corresponding laterally extending axle snap pin on each feed receptacle which is a component of each feeder station.\n\nEach feed receptacle may be self-supporting and self-retaining by the use of an attached integral axle snap pin. The axle snap pin of each feed receptacle is bifurcated defining a longitudinally extending slot which allow the leading. protruding snaps to inwardly spring to provide a bypass snap fit engagement of the apertured distal end of each rotor. The axle snap pin may be further provided with a radial flange to prevent inadvertent removal of the feed receptacle from the rotor aperture, once snap fit in place. Once again, a household lubricant may be applied to reduce the friction between the axle snap pin and the apertured support at the distal rotor end.\n\nThe feed receptacles are each provided with a cavity that may be of any shape. However, a generally rectangular shape is preferred with a rolled edge perimeter perch, designed to allow facile landing and perching of the feeding birds. The bottom surfaces of the feed receptacle cavities may be provided with small weep holes to allow for drainage of any accumulated moisture and help prevent the spoilage of feed. Each feed receptacle is spatially located lower than the level of its corresponding axle snap pin. Furthermore, the feed receptacle's \"center of gravity\" is also lower relative to the axle snap pin, which keeps each cavity in a generally upright position as it turns or rocks on its own axle snap pin.\n\nAlternatively, the feed receptacles may be provided with a mounting receptacle for receiving a block or any shape of a conglomerate of bird seed and/or any other type of food i.e., suet, lard, peanut butter, cracked corn, insects, meat, etc. It is conceivable that some or all of the feed receptacle cavities may also be filled with water or other fluids to provide drinking or bathing for the birds. In this instance, the weep holes would not be formed.\n\nThe individual feed receptacles may be further embellished with roof-like structures and/or decorated sides. A feed receptacle coupled to a roof-like structure forms a feeder station. The feeder stations turn, swing and teeter-totter simply by the out of balance weight, movement and momentum shift of the feeding birds. Again, the \"center of gravity\" of each feeder station is sufficiently low relative to the axle snap pin so that each station remains in a generally upright position. The feeder stations turn simultaneously but independently of the vertical structural carousel.\n\nAll the components simply slide and or snap together without the need for hand tools. They can be easily disassembled, by reversing the assembly procedure, grasping specific features intended for disassembly and pulling the components apart from each other. Furthermore, the whole device can be tailored to attract specific groups of people that have certain interests; i.e., people from different areas of the country may prefer different styles of architecture, and different races, cultures or religions may want the device embellished with certain shapes, symbols or figures.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS\n\nFIG. 1 is a perspective view of the bird feeder device.\n\nFIG. 2 is a front elevational view of the bird feeder device.\n\nFIG. 3 is a rear elevational view of the bird feeder device.\n\nFIG. 4 is a side elevational view of the bird feeder device showing a vertical support transition to a horizontal support in phantom.\n\nFIG. 7 is an enlarged top perspective view of the feed receptacle showing the bifurcated axle snap pin with radial flange.\n\nFIG. 8 is another enlarged top perspective view of the feed receptacle again showing the bifurcated axle snap pin with radial flange.\n\nFIG. 9 is a side elevational view of the feed receptacle.\n\nFIG. 10 is a sectional view of the axle snap pin taken along line 10—10 of FIG. 9.\n\nFIG. 11 is a bottom perspective view of the roof-like structure.\n\nFIG. 12 is a front perspective view of the feeder station.\n\nFIG. 13 is a front perspective view of the feeder station in an exploded condition.\n\nFIG. 14 is a rear perspective view of the feeder station in an exploded condition.\n\nFIG. 15 is a rear perspective view of the feeder station.\n\nFIG. 16 is a rear perspective view of the vertical structural carousel\n\nFIG. 17 is a sectional view of a rotor.\n\nFIG. 18 is a perspective view of the rotor.\n\nFIG. 19 is a front elevational view of a feeder station including the rotor, feed receptacle and roof-like structure attached thereto.\n\nFIG. 20 is a perspective view of the bird feeder device showing one rotor, feed receptacle and roof-like structure in an exploded condition.\n\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION\n\nWith reference to FIG. 1, the bird feeder device 10 includes a generally vertical structural carousel 12, a plurality of radial extending rotors 14, and a plurality of feeder stations 16. The vertical structural carousel 12 is mounted and turns about a horizontal fulcrum or aperture 20 about axis 18. The horizontal fulcrum 20 may be securely and rotationally attached to a support means 22 (shown in phantom in FIG. 4), which in turn may be mounted on any stationary object (not shown) that is sturdy enough to support the combined weight of the device 10 while filled with feed and supporting several birds.\n\nThe diameter of the vertical structural carousel 12, while small in comparison to the overall diameter of the device, has a sufficient perimeter to allow the mounting of a plurality of radially extending rotors 14 thereon. Referring now to FIGS. 1 and 20, rigidity of the carousel 12 is accomplished by the use of several radial projecting gussets 24 from a central hollow bushing 26 along the back wall 27 of the carousel 12 to the outer ring 28 where the rotors 14 are attached.\n\nThe rotors 14 are shown in FIGS. 17 and 18. Each rotor has a pair of opposed stiffening ribs 74 that extend between the elongate web member 76. Each rotor includes a first end 30 and a second end 36. As best seen in FIGS. 1 and 20, the radial extending rotors 14 are attached at end 30 to the outer ring 28 of the carousel 12. An arcuate shaped \"T\" slide 31 is formed in each end 30 of each rotor 14. The \"T\" slide 31 is provided with at least one mounting ear 32 which allows the rotor 14 to be slidingly attached to an oppositely disposed receiving arcuate shaped \"T\" slot 35 formed between the protruding retainer cap rails 34 on the outer ring 28 of the carousel 12. The opposite side of the carousel 12, including the arcuate shaped \"T\" slots 35, is shown in FIG. 10. A releasable pawl 33 is formed in each rotor end 30 to lock the rotor onto the carousel 12 after installation.\n\nAs seen in FIGS. 17 and 18, the distal end 36 of each rotor 14 includes an aperture 38 located opposite the end 30 and integral to the generally cylindrical end 40 of the arm 14. The aperture 38 is of a size and shape compatible to receive and co-axially support a corresponding mated lateral extending axle snap pin 42 attached to each feed receptacle 44.\n\nNow referring to FIGS. 1 through 4, 19 and 20, the individual feeder stations 16 may be of any size and shape appropriate for the types or species of birds to be attracted, the overall size of the device 10, and the aesthetic desires of the user. In the preferred embodiment, the feeding stations 16 include generally rectangular feed receptacle 44 and a roof-like structure 48. The edge 50 of the receptacle 44 may include a rolled perch 52 that provides added strength and rigidity to the receptacle. The rolled perch 52 provides a better grip for feeding birds as their claws may easily grasp its contour for a more comfortable feeding position. Further, the bottom surface 56 of the receptacle 44 may be supplied with perforations 70 to provide drainage and circulation, thus preventing spoilage of feed.\n\nThe feed receptacle 44 also includes a vertically : extending back support surface 46. Referring to FIGS. 6 through 9 and 12 through 15, the vertically extending back support surface 46 is preferably integrally molded to the feed receptacle 44 and includes a front 58 and a back 60. The support surface 46 extends vertically from the receptacle 44 and provides the attachment means for the optional roof-like structure 48 desired to be attached thereon. With particular reference to FIGS. 6 through 9, the back 60 of the support surface 46 is integrally molded to further provide a longitudinally extending, bifurcated, axle snap pin 42. The axle snap pin 42 defines a longitudinal slot 62 defined by the bifurcated members, 42a, 42b. The bifurcated members 42a and 42b pass through the aperture 38 to circumferentially engage the aperture 38 in rotor 14. A cross sectional view of the pin 42 is shown in FIG. 10. With reference to FIGS. 6, 7 and 8 it can be seen that the distal end 54 of the axle snap pin 42 is provided with a snap retainer flange 64 that, once through the aperture 38, resists removal.\n\nAs best seen in FIGS. 1 and 20-, each feed receptacle 44 may be further provided with an interlocking roof-like structure 48. As shown in FIGS. 11,13 and 14, the roof-like structure 48 includes a downwardly extending attachment tongue 66. Now referring to FIGS. 8 and 13, tongue 66 slides into and frictionally engages with the vertically extending channel pocket 68 defined by the supporting webs 68a and 68b in the front surface 58 of the support surface 46 of the feed receptacle 44 creating a tapered lock fit. When the tongue 66 is fully inserted into the channel pocket 68, the lower edge 80 of roof-like structure 48 is in substantial contact with the lower surface 82 in pocket 68 of feed receptacle 44. An assembled feed receptacle 44 and roof-like structure 48 forms the feeder station 16 shown in FIGS. 12 and 15.\n\nThe roof-like structure 48 is preferably injection molded plastic and may be molded with or without shingles or other patterns on the surface.\n\nTo be pleasingly aesthetic, a variety of surface configurations may be applied to the feed receptacles 44 and roof-like structures 48. As shown in the drawings, vertical batten boards may be formed in each receptacle. Shingle configurations may be formed in the roof structure. It is to be understood that these features are aesthetic only and are not meant to limit or narrow the scope of the present invention. While exemplary configurations have been shown, countless other configurations exist and could be applied to each component without deviating from the scope of the invention.", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "32f9e9e0-e3b8-4224-8174-fadf219d1c70", "url": "http://www.google.com/patents/US6394030?dq=7,172,682"}

{"text": "Four defeats in a row, including Saturday's 1-0 reverse at West Brom, have\nforced West Ham to make a decision on Sam Allardyce's future at next month's\nboard meeting\n\nSam Allardyce's future as West\nHam United manager will be on the agenda next month as the club's\nboard face a huge dilemma on whether to stick or twist. Allardyce is\nscheduled for a meeting with the owners to discuss the transfer budget for\nnext season but the growing hostility from West Ham supporters towards him\nis threatening to bring his three-year tenure to an end.\n\nWest Ham's board believe that Allardyce has fulfilled his remit of virtually\nensuring Premier League survival for the second successive season but are\nbecoming increasingly aware of the fans' frustration. The venom and bile\ndirected at Allardyce from the away end during the 1-0 defeat at the\nHawthorns on Saturday was not from a minority of supporters and this summer\npromises to be pivotal for the 59-year-old.\n\nDavid Sullivan, the co-chairman, who was clearly disturbed by the reaction,\nsaid: \"I am not saying anything now. We'll discuss it at the end of the\nseason as we always do.\"\n\nAllardyce, who has one year left on his contract, is keen to rebuild his squad\nand wants the funds to pursue a proven forward to ease the pressure on Andy\nCarroll. But despite guaranteeing another season at the top table, it seems\nthat he has as many points as admirers at West Ham due to his methods and\ntactics. This fourth successive defeat, after such an ineffective\nperformance, will have done little to improve his popularity.\n\nWhen asked if he was confident of financial backing this summer, Allardyce\nreplied: \"I don't see any problem in terms of what we've been talking about\nbut you never know, do you? We've had preliminary discussions [about the\ntransfer budget] but all of those have been put on hold for the last four\ngames. I can hear the chanting, I know about that and I've had it before.\nEveryone's miserable because we haven't won. Criticism comes on me because\nI'm responsible to make the team win.\"\n\nThe wild scenes of celebration from West\nBromwich Albion fans at the end were in stark contrast to the hatred\naimed at Allardyce. At the eighth attempt, after so many dramatic near\nmisses, Pepe Mel finally won a game at the Hawthorns and survival is now in\nsight.\n\nSaido Berahino's 11th-minute goal, from virtually on the goalline, was all\nthey had to show for their dominance but Albion never make it easy.\n\nBen Foster, the goalkeeper, said: \"This was a massive win and probably gets us\nwithin touching distance of safety but we're not safe yet, it's as simple as\nthat. We've got Arsenal and Sunderland away and then Stoke at home and I'd\nlike to think we'll get four to six points from them, so hopefully it will\nbe a strong finish.\"", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "a845bb97-9529-4c3d-9fa6-d2ea445840a6", "url": "http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/west-ham/10791469/West-Ham-board-put-Sam-Allardyces-future-on-the-agenda.html"}

{"text": "Real estate finders fees in New Jersey.\n\nI began buying real estate properties in New Jersey and renting them out. I work with one agency only, the agency sells properties to me and then lists them for rent. So far I gave the agency 7 deals (sales and rentals). My question is, it illegal for me to ask the agency to give some money back to me on each new transaction lets call it finders fee. I am asking for 10% of what I bring into the agency. So that if total commission is 5,000 being split between buyer agency and seller agency. My cut would be $250\n\nHelp the community by answering this question:\n\nAnswers\n\nV -\nSure there are givebacks that happen in some cases. I am sure you can ask and see what can be worked out. As Deb has noted -\n\n\"Buyer rebates are legal in New Jersey, but must be disclosed and agreed upon in advance. Therefore, if the agency with which you work agrees to enter a rebate program with you for your purchases, that is legally compliant.\"\n\nSure there are givebacks that happen in some cases. I am sure you can ask and see what can be worked out. Terms like \"referral\" and \"Finder's Fee\" would not pertain to you as an unlicensed buyer.\n\nI am guessing by your thoughts that the one of your clients has come to you and asked you to give them a 10% of your pay or off your service that you perform for them -or- You feel that the agency's work is of minimal value, you do a lot of work yourself, so you should also take a portion of the profits.\n\nWhy not just get your Realtors license? Pay the fees involved, the advertising, the legwork, the paperwork and just do it yourself? That way you can absorb more of the commission.\nBy your statement below \"both require lots of schooling and actually working as a realtor\" seems that you do not want to take the time to earn the commission that you want to take back.\n\nIt costs substantially more than $300 to become an active Realtor.\n\nLet me know what happens when your boss wants 10% of your pay handed back just because he feels he wants it.\n\nUnfortunately, Tim is incorrect. According to NJ State Law it is illegal for anyone to receive any fee for real estate unless he/she holds a NJ Real Estate License. My recommendation is to get your license which costs about $300 for the class and then you can get any referral fee you negotiate on each transaction. You may find it to be well worth it to do so. When I was actively buying properties I would get that on each purchase as I held my license. Otherwise, it is not legal for you to receive anything from the Broker for the deals.\n\nIm pretty sure, you need to be licensed to get paid. It's worth for you to take the sales license class and pass the state test and get you referral license.\nThe class is very educational and same time you will make some $.\n\nHi,\nI believe it is now legal to collect a finder's fee in New Jersey. There are certain forms that you would need to fill out ahead of time. The fee would be paid to you at closing and would be on the respa statement. I would assume if you were getting a 10% fee on the selling agency commission that the 10% would be coming off the top. I think the fee is on a buyer commission only, but a listing fee is always between a buyer and a seller. The agency you work with may have a policy of not paying a fee, but if you have been happy with the results, you might want to stay with them anyway.\n\nGetting a license will require some schooling, the state mandates 75 hrs. However, you do not need to be a Realtor or pay lots of fess to maintain it or worry about continuing education. . What you can do is get a referral license, which typically has minimal yearly fees(e.g $150/yr) and will exempt you from continuing education and you will not have to be a Realtor. Total costs to pay for school and licensing fees should not be more than $700 in this case. There are some referral groups which will pay as high as 90% splits, which again make this a good option as well as easy to deal with. Plus it means you can make money for referring other investors, sellers, buyers, etc. to brokers.\n\nMany others on Trulia have mentioned buyer rebates, however your question was about a finder's fee. They are very different. More importantly, if a broker decides on offering rebates, rebates have to be offered to all buyer clients equally, otherwise it is discriminatory(similar to the practice of offering home warranties to sellers). As a result, few brokerages in NJ will engage in this practice. As a Broker and a licensed NJ Real Estate Instructor, these are topics I am well versed in and if you wish to have more of a dialogue, just let me know and I may be able to point you in the right direction.\n\nIn order to obtain a referral license, you would need to complete the classes for a salesperson's license and pass the state test. The education and testing process is the same for an active real estate license or a referral license. Licensees who maintain active licenses are required to partake in continuing education (12 hours every 2 years.) Referral licensees are not required to take continuing education.\n\nThe third type of real estate license is a broker's license. You need to have experience and additional education to pursue a broker's license. A broker's license is required to manage real estate salespersons and office, or own a real estate brokerage. A very small percentage of real estate salespersons become brokers.\n\nA brokerage can only pay a commission or fee to one of the licensed agents in their own agency, or to another broker.\n\nBuyer rebates are legal in New Jersey, but must be disclosed and agreed upon in advance. Therefore, if the agency with which you work agrees to enter a rebate program with you for your purchases, that is legally compliant. That rebate is only applicable to the buyer agency commission, not the entire real estate fee.\n\nYou may not receive finders fees for bringing other clients to the agency. In order to receive any compensation for referrals, you will need to obtain a license. Many individuals hold real estate licenses solely for the purpose of generating referrals, and there is even a license category for \"referral agents.\"\n\nAs it pertains to the agency finding renters for you. you are paying the listing broker who might be co-broking the deal if the other agency brings the renter to the table. Herein, you would not get a rebate....but you can try to negotiate the fee that you are charged to be less. You wouldn't receive a check, but a bill for a lesser amount. Be careful in your negotiations that you do not compromise your results by negotiating the fee too low. The end result of rentals is usually about accommodation and not much of a revenue generator for most agents. Perhaps on the listing side of the rental commission there might be some room.....but, proceed with open eyes and mind to the discussion.\n\nIan thanks for your advice. I looked on NJ real estate commission website and I only see two types of licenses agent and broker both require lots of schooling and actually working as a realtor. Is there another type of license that you talking about ?", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "cac7001e-5624-488b-9d8a-571a7e257806", "url": "http://www.trulia.com/voices/Home_Buying/Real_estate_finders_fees_in_New_Jersey_-380413"}

It's always a pleasure to aid the boys who don't know their toys.\n\nThe elf twins are pictured with medieval lances which could run between 9 and 16 feet long. I used photo reference I acquired myself at a reenactment, and the arms and armor are accurate.\n\nOf course a pike could be even longer than a lance: up to 20 feet.\n\nLances were sometimes heavily decorated, especially for tourneys, hence the leaf design here, which I thought appropriate considering the subject. The lances I used for reference were wound by ribbons.\n\nI'm sorry, was my question somehow insulting? I know that Tolkien has a meticulously detailed world and I couldn't remember lances being a big part of that. I'm not really a medieval weapons guy, I'm afraid. Thanks for the info.\n\nNo, I thought your question was funny. Tone is notoriously hard to convey online, so I suppose my tone didn't come across as funny, either. Sorry about that, and no worries.\n\nTolkien wrote of weapons a lot, but usually doesn't describe them in detail. He wrote of spears specifically, but there is little info on size and shape, except for the spear of Gil Galad. Which was supposed to be big. How big, I don't know.\n\nI've been doing a series of drawings for prelim work for a painting of the rescue of Celebrian, and I'm really not sure how to approach the weapons there. I'm rooting around a bit on the visuals.\n\nAnd to totally geek you out, the spear of Gil Galad is briefly referred to as a lance in \"Fellowship\", and was nine feet long with a blade two feet long. I dunno if it would have been as thick as my funny-looking poles.

{"text": "Kat Reviews Disney's \"Frozen\"\n\nIf you don't see another family movie this week, make sure that you've seen \"Frozen.\"\n\nDisney's \"Frozen\" follows two princess, Anna and Elsa in their struggle to rekindle their sisterly love after years of staying separated because of a special gift that Elsa has. Elsa possesses the power to create winter, and after an accident, injuring her sister Anna, when they were young children, she has to learn to \"conceal. Don't feel\" in order to protect those around her from her powers. After the death of the mother & father, the sisters are all that is left of their family.

{"text": "CENTER VALLEY, Pa. -- Teams have had the chance to reflect on the first half of Patriot League play, and this weekend brings the start of the second leg with three contests Saturday and one Sunday on CBS Sports Network.\n\nNavy hit the turn in first place at 6-1 for the second time in three seasons. The Mids have a one-game lead on American and Army, which are tied for second at 5-2, while Bucknell owns fourth at 4-3.\n\nThe race for a top-four spot in the regular season standings will heat up in the coming weeks, as it means a home game in the quarterfinals of the Patriot League Tournament. A top-two spot guarantees a home semifinal contest if the team advances that far.\n\nBut there's a lot of work to be done for all eight clubs before each thinks about March basketball. The second leg officially begins Saturday when Lafayette, winners of three straight League games for the first time since 1998, hosts the Mids at 2 p.m. American, looking to rebound from Saturday's loss to the Leopards, visits Colgate at 4 p.m. The Raiders have been close in several contests but are still seeking their first League win of the season. Saturday's final contest pits Army against Bucknell in Lewisburg, Pa.\n\nSunday's Holy Cross-Lehigh contest tips off from Stabler Arena at 2 p.m. on CBS Sports Network. The Mountain Hawks won in Worcester Jan. 12, but have lost five of six since. Holy Cross has won two straight League games after a 1-4 start.\n\nPatriot League Women's Basketball Quick Hits\n\n• The Patriot League is one of 13 conferences in the nation with a winning record in non-conference play.\n\n• Lafayette junior Danielle Fiacco is nine blocks away from becoming the second in League history with two seasons of 90 or more. The other is Bucknell's Hope Foster.\n\n• Five of the last 10 Patriot League champions have had at least a share of first place at the halfway mark of League play in their title seasons.\n\n• Lafayette has won three straight League contests for the first time since 1998.\n\n• Navy's six League victories have come by an average of 18.7 points.\n\n• American, Bucknell, Lehigh and Navy have used the same starting lineup for all seven League games.\n\n• Three Patriot Leaguers are ranked in the NCAA top 10 as of Monday: Danielle Fiacco (Lafayette) is third in blocks (3.86), while Army's Aimee Oertner is ninth (2.95). Holy Cross' Alex Smith is seventh in made 3s per game (3.14).\n\nPatriot League Notebook\n\nIT'S ACADEMIC A pair of guards from American were honored Jan. 31 as Alexis Dobbs and Jen Dumiak were named to the Capital One Academic All-District First Team by the College Sports Information Directors of America (CoSIDA). Both are on the first team in District 2. Dobbs is making her second straight appearance on the squad, while Dumiak is a first-time honoree. Dobbs is the reigning Patriot League Scholar-Athlete of the Year.\n\nFIRST IS A GOOD PLACE TO BE Navy enters the second leg of League play in first place 6-1 for the second time in the last three years. The Mids claimed the first of their two straight titles in 2011 after hitting the turn with just one League loss, and they hope this year's result is exactly the same. Five of the last 10 League champions were at least tied for first place at the turn, but only two since 2006: Navy (2011) and Lehigh (2009). Holy Cross (2003, 2005) and Colgate (2004) were also no worse than tied for first at the midway point before capturing the League crown that March.\n\nPATRIOT LEAGUE ON CBS SPORTS NETWORK The Patriot League returns to CBS Sports Network Sunday as Lehigh hosts Holy Cross to start the second half of League play. The Mountain Hawks took a last-second 67-65 victory in Worcester Jan. 12 on Katie O'Reilly's layup. Sunday's tip is set for 2 p.m. from Stabler Arena with Bob Socci handling play-by-play and Amy Lawrence providing the analysis. CBS Sports Network will also televise the Patriot League championship Saturday, March 16 at 6 p.m.\n\nBIG YEAR FOR UNDERCLASSMEN Take a look at the League's top 20 in scoring, and get ready to see a lot of these names next season. Seventeen of the League's top 20 scorers are all underclassmen. The only seniors are Army's Anna Simmers (third, 13.0 ppg), Colgate's Jhazmine Lynch (17th, 9.3) and Bucknell's Alyssa Dunn (20th, 9.0). Holy Cross junior Alex Smith leads at 15.0 per game, while Army freshman Kelsey Minato is the top scorer in League play at 16.0.\n\nTHE RACE TO HOST The second leg of League play begins the push for the Patriot League Touranment in earnest and, especially, a top-four spot. That's because all rounds of the tournament are hosted by the higher seeds. The top four teams will host the quarterfinal, and the top two the semifinals. The better of the two remaining seeds will host the championship game March 16.\n\nPART OF THE 1,000 CLUB Holy Cross junior Alex Smith tallied 18 points Jan. 19 to eclipse the 1,000-point plateau for her career. She joins a long list of student-athletes in League history who have accomplished that feat, including Colgate senior Jhazmine Lynch and Holy Cross senior Amy Lepley, who did so earlier this season. Two 1,000-point scorers graduated last season in Lehigh's Emily Gratch (1,112) and American's Lisa Strack (1,059). Two others are definitely within striking distance of 1,000 this season, both juniors. Bucknell's Shelby Romine (989) and Navy's Jade Geif (939) appear poised to reach the mark soon.\n\nCORKERY EDGING CLOSER At 98-48 overall at American, head coach Matt Corkery ranks among the best in the League all-time in win percentage (.671). Corkery is also chasing the League record for fastest to 100 victories, a mark that is currently owned by Holy Cross' Bill Gibbons. Gibbons reached 100 victories in 149 contests, with his 100th triumph coming in the 1995-96 season opener against Syracuse. Corkery would match Gibbons' record with a 2-1 mark in American's next three contests. American visits Colgate Saturday at 4 p.m.\n\nNON-LEAGUE PLAY DONE... `TIL THE POSTSEASON The eight Patriot League teams have finished off one of their best non-conference showings in some time, putting together a 63-56 mark against out-of-conference foes. That record far surpasses last season's final 49-72 showing, which included Holy Cross' win in the first round of the WBI over New Hampshire. Strong showings have been had this season against the Northeast Conference (14-8), Ivy League (11-6) and the MAAC (10-8).\n\nON TWITTER, TOO Fans and media members can follow Patriot League women's basketball on Twitter - @PL_WBB.\n\n• Alix Membreno paced three Navy players in double figures with 19 points in the Mids' 62-44 victory in the previous meeting Jan. 13.

In my case it is each of the baby's grandmothers, most of whom are already grandmother's to our siblings kids. Was thinking about a Grandma photo frame but since they are already grandma's, didn't know. Empty photo album? Flowers?\n\nComments (9)\n\nOne of my aunts is throwing mine and i have another one that is making the cake. I was planning on getting them bamboo. i think that it is so cool and comes in all different sizes and styles. The aunt that is actually throwing the shower will be receiving a larger one than the one that is making the cake. But i like the idea of bamboo because it is alive and will keep growing for as long as the person takes care if it. i feel that it will be a constant reminder of my gratitude for them throwing/helping throw the shower. I don't think that they expect anything though, i just think that it is a nice thing to do to say thank you.\n\nWhere I am from we don't give hostess gifts. For my 1st baby I was thrown a HUGE shower of almost 100 people by my mom and MIL and sister and stepmom. They didnt expect anything at all and I didnt give them anything.\n\nThis time around I had a baby sprinkle in the new state I live in given by my two friends. Some of my family came from NJ and it was really, really nice. I didnt know ettique here so I did wind up getting each of the hostesses good bottles of wine (they are wine drinkers). just as a nice thank you.\n\nHostess gifts have really gotten big here lately. It's kind of creepy to me. Because you give them a gift and send them a thank you note for the shower....Then they send you a thank you note for the gift you gave them. It's a tad redundant. Whats next sending them a thank you note for their thank you note. Regardless of how creepy I find it, I'm doing jars of local honey. Mainly because I plan on forcing my baby to call my mother Hunny. But it's sweet and cheap.\n\nI will absolutely buy a thank you gift for mom and sister (they are throwing my one shower) and my co-worker (she is throwing my other). I plan to get some wine and chocolates for each of them. They are all three wine drinkers. I just think it is a nice way to say thank you for all of the time, effort, and resources they have put towards being involved.\n\n--\n\nMom to Isabella - 08/28/2001 & Juliette - 06/19/2010\n\nThere is no way to be a perfect mother..but a million ways to be a good one!\n\nAt the very end of the shower, I thanked them for the wonderful party in front of everyone and gave them each their gifts. It was clear from all of the whispering that most people were surprised by it, including the gift recipients. I loved that it was completely unexpected, and a nice way to show them that I really appreciated the shower.\n\nI also got a small gift for my SIL who coordinated all of the little details- like favors and games.\n\nI had my first baby shower yesterday and got the hostess a gift card to Michaels and a set of coasters that matches her kitchen theme. I have a few more showers coming up and plan to get a gift for each hostess. It may not be expected, but it's a nice way to show your appreciation. If you've ever hosted a shower before (and I have), you know how much work goes into pulling it off!\n\nI'm doing flowers, a bottle of wine and personalized stationery. It's not so much the GIFT but the THOUGHT - it could be anything. The hostesses are spending a lot of time and money to do something nice for you. And while they (probably) don't EXPECT a gift in return, it's a thoughtful gesture when we're the ones receiving tons of gifts.\n\nI guess it depends on the part of the country you live in? Around here not acknowledging the generosity of the hostess is considered ungrateful.", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "061e88d6-4cd9-4de6-8dc5-c22451af224d", "url": "http://community.babycenter.com/post/a22432079/shower-thrower_gift"}

Both sisters were members of the gospel choir at their father's Detroit church. Although she was always overshadowed by her sister's fame, talent does run in the family.

Its 26 tracks contain everything she recorded for the Epic and Shout labels between 1961 and 1968. That includes her 1962 Epic LP, HER NAME IS ERMA, various early-'60s non-LP Epic singles, and the seven tracks she recorded for Shout in 1967-68 (among them the 1967 Top Ten R&B hit \"Piece of My Heart\"). Like Aretha Franklin's pre-Atlantic work for Columbia during the same era, Erma's Epic output in particular was pretty uneven, with too much emphasis on orchestrated popular standards. Yet mixed in with those were some gutsy early soul and girl group-style sides, a few of which--especially \"Don't Wait Too Long\" (penned by sister Carolyn Franklin) and the downright terrific \"I Don't Want No Mama's Boy\"--were arguably grittier and stronger material-wise than anything Aretha was doing in a similar vein in the early-'60s. More suitable soul tunes became less of a problem in her short but impressive stint with Shout, which included the down 'n' dirty, bluesy Carolyn Franklin composition \"Don't Catch the Dog's Bone\" and the obscure Carole King/Gerry Goffin number \"Don't Have the Right to Cry.\" To repeat an unavoidable comparison, Erma's voice wasn't quite as amazing as Aretha's, but it was real good, and deserving of more success than it got at Epic or Shout (or her subsequent time at Brunswick, unrepresented on this compilation). This well-annotated package is a fine commemoration of her underrated talent, though audiophiles should be aware that two of her Epic singles had to be remastered from vinyl here as the master tapes are missing.", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "28dc2cac-86c1-4114-865f-e8b3381ccfdb", "url": "http://www.oldies.com/product-view/54532.html"}

{"text": "Murray in the frame for France\n\nSCOTLAND's hopes of building on their morale-boosting victory over Italy in Rome were raised yesterday with the addition of the British and Irish Lions prop Euan Murray to their squad for the RBS 6 Nations match against France at Murrayfield on Saturday.\n\nThe 33-year-old Worcester forward had been in danger of missing the whole tournament after cutting a thumb while chopping wood at a barbecue with his team-mates. The experienced tighthead was still recovering from a leg problem picked up in November, during which he won his 58th cap against Australia.\n\nThe Edinburgh half-backs Sean Kennedy and Harry Leonard also trained with the squad yesterday. Kennedy returned to the Edinburgh side just before the hour mark of their victory over Ospreys on Friday night. The scrum-half had spent the previous month on loan at London Irish, who called him in as emergency cover, with Edinburgh using the deal to help the 22-year-old complete his return to full fitness and match sharpness following a knee injury.\n\nLoading article content\n\nLeonard, a 21-year-old stand-off, has made 36 appearances for Edinburgh and is a former Scotland Under-20 internationalist.\n\nPromoted stories\n\nShould Murray find his way into Scotland's team on Saturday, he will be facing a French front row featuring their third-choice hooker. The visiting coach, Phillipe Saint-Andre, has lost both his No.1, Clermont's Ben Kayser, and also the veteran Dimitri Szarewski, who has been ruled out with an ankle injury sustained while playing for Racing Metro at the weekend.\n\nComing in is Perpignan's 27-year-old hooker Guilhem Guirado, who won the last of his 18 caps in June against New Zealand in Aucklanf.\n\nFrance had already called up the Castres wing Marc Andreu after the Clermont half-back Morgan Parra was given a two-match suspension.

Scotland faces competition from England and Wales as well as the likes of Fiji, Hong Kong, New Zealand and South Africa, for the World Cup Sevens in 2018.\n\nThe IRB yesterday revealed those unions are joined by countries such as Argentina, Brazil, China, Japan, Portugal, Russia and the United Arab Emirates in challenging for a round of the Sevens World Series in two seasons' time. The IRB chairman Bernard Lapasset commented: \"This unprecedented response truly reflects the enormous prestige and appeal of rugby sevens in the global sporting market place ahead of our Rio 2016 Olympic Games debut.

Vision's Kevin Corcoran Addresses Licensing Conference\n\nOct 27th 2004\n\nA.D. VISION'S KEVIN CORCORAN ADDRESSES LICENSING CONFERENCE\nON BUILDING PARTNERSHIPS WITH MAJOR RETAILERS AS COMPANY\nLOOKS TO EXPAND LICENSING AND MERCHANDISING OPPORTUNITIES\n\nKevin Corcoran of A.D. Vision, Inc. (ADV) will offer insights into building successful merchandising partnerships with major retailers, as part of the November 2-4 LINK event (License Magazine's Licensing International Networking Conference) in Miami, Florida. ADV, through its subsidiary, ADV Films, is the leading producer and distributor of Japanese animation (anime) and related products, capitalizing on one of the hottest trends in entertainment.\n\nLINK, presented by License! Magazine, is an executive-level conference and networking opportunity tailored to licensing executives. On the second day of the conference, Corcoran will address attendees on how to successfully pitch a new product to major retailers, including Best Buy, Musicland and Suncoast, as well as how to then develop strong partnerships with these retailers in an effort to build a loyal and solid consumer base. Corcoran will provide specific examples of how ADV has collaborated with retailers to grow America's anime fans into one of the fastest growing consumer segments of entertainment goods and services. He will also discuss how the company utilized stellar relationships with retailers to expand beyond its core business into new areas such as publishing and merchandising.\n\nCorcoran serves as EVP, COO and CFO of Houston-based ADV, which has helped fuel the burgeoning anime business into an estimated $4.5 billion industry. Primarily known for its success in the home video market, ADV is now experiencing unparalleled growth due to strategic expansions into cable television, publishing and consumer goods. Their ADV Toys division, created in August 2003, creates and markets exclusive toys and collectible merchandise based upon the company's extensive film, manga (graphic novel) and original content holdings. In only its first year, the division has brought to market merchandise in a number of categories, including hats, lunchboxes, plush toys, t-shirts and more. The company will begin meeting with potential licensees in 2005 for a full-scale merchandising campaign on behalf of its hundreds of titles.\n\nSince it was founded 12 years ago as an importer of Japanese animation titles, A.D. Vision, Inc. has grown exponentially. It now encompasses a multitude of complementary media divisions, spanning television, publishing, licensing and merchandising and continues to identify new areas for growth. The company maintains two publishing arms: Newtype USA, the premier monthly anime and manga magazine, and ADV Manga, publishers of graphic novels.\n\nIn December 2002, ADV also launched Anime Network,™ America's first and only television network dedicated exclusively to anime and anime-related programming. After its initial launch as a video-on-demand (VOD) service on one cable system (Comcast) in one city (Philadelphia), the channel has grown to reach across 55 cities and 11 million homes. The network also recently became the first and only cable channel to grow from a strictly VOD service to a linear, 24-hour, seven days a week channel when it launched on Insight cable systems in Columbus, Ohio in July 2004", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "64961d15-542b-41a3-a039-64ba6819848c", "url": "http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/press-release/2004-10-27/a.d-vision's-kevin-corcoran-addresses-licensing-conference"}

{"text": "Accupart Ltd\n\nA mate phoned me last Thursday, he couldn't get his laptop screen to display. Back-light or inverter I thought. So he left it with me. I could vaguely see his desktop when holding the laptop up to the light, so a back-light problem I thought. I removed the screen and noticed the back-light had burnt out. It's a bit of a hassle to source and replace a back-light, so we decided on a new screen at £63.\n\nI phoned Accupart Ltd in Manchester at 3:30pm on Friday and talked to a very pleasant guy who recommended a screen, took my card details and waived the delivery charge to Northern Ireland. 23 hours later, on Saturday afternoon at 2:30 pm I had the screen in my hands. Amazing service, wish more suppliers were as good as that.\n\nAn hour after that, by the way, the screen was installed and the laptop back to normal, no dead pixels either. Well done Accupart Ltd.\n\nIts great to hear about these recommendations, instead of hearing about increasing poor service from some sections of the industry. The item then worked virtually straight out of the box, which can only be another bonus point. Its a case of wait and see now, should any problems arise later on.\n\nWe have a old large photocopier that required a new 'bulb'. No matter where we tried (manufacturer's to main dealer's), it was the case of \"Sorry no can do\". Tried a one person business a few miles away, informed that he would have a look around. By the evening, the person called with item. £25.00 and the deal was done. Only problem, when we tried to fit the 'bulb' we broke it. Contacted the person again for a possible replacement. Not only did he deliver the item a few hours later, but fitted it as well, and all for £25.00 again!.\n\nHi fellas, it's good to come across a decent supplier and I must admit that the fact they also operate through Amazon did give me a little more confidence, even though, from past experience, that, in itself, is no recommendation. It is an Acer laptop but when I phoned Acer they couldn't help with a new screen, that's why I phoned Accupart directly. The guy on the phone couldn't have been more helpful recommending a replacement screen. Personally I like to hear about decent companies and commit them to memory for future reference, hopefully my experience with Accupart will help others in the same position.\n\nSynology invite you to their launch event on 16th September 2015.

Park Ave., Houma, he is responsible for every dish in the enormous selection of Asian and American cuisines offered. Considering that the restaurant is always at or near its 400-seat capacity during the lunch and dinner buffets, quantity has to match quality to keep customers satisfied.\n\n\"I order all the food, organize everything before it is cooked and make sure everything is prepared to a high standard,\" said Xie, 28. \"I always have to cook extra because you don't want to run out of anything. That's a challenge.\"\n\nXie has to maintain two fully-stocked walk-in refrigerators to keep up with customers' appetites. Filling their culinary needs has created a large and loyal base for Dynasty Buffet.\n\nIts popularity is one of the reasons James Yang bought the restaurant four months ago.\n\n\"This restaurant is one of the biggest in Houma, and people enjoy it,\" said Yang, 26. \"Everybody likes the food here.\"\n\nThe best-selling item is the $13.49 seafood dinner buffet, which is offered on Fridays and Saturdays.\n\nOther popular choices include the chicken wings, barbecue spare ribs, fried rice, lo mein, the sushi bar and hibachi bar.\n\nYang and Gilbert said they are always looking to add more dishes to the menu; however, patrons' devotion to their usual meals makes it hard to change.\n\n\"Some customers come back for just one or two items. If we change it, they're not going to be happy,\" Yang said. \"It takes time for the customers to get used to a new item. Maybe we put it there a few days before the customers will begin to try it.\"\n\nGilbert said she enjoys working with customer requests.\n\n\"We want them to be happy,\" she said. \"We want to add more choices, whether it's the entrées, desserts, the salad bar or a new soup we're trying.\"\n\nXie developed a passion for food in his homeland of Fujian, China. He likes to try many different types of food. After graduating from culinary school in 2002, he became a cook in several restaurants in China, before immigrating to the U.S. in 2009. He cooked in a restaurant in Texas before joining Dynasty Buffet.\n\n\"My relatives told me to come to America and learn the restaurant business,\" Xie said. \"It's hard to make money in China. I came here to learn more about cooking, and in the future, open a restaurant.\"\n\nGilbert managed restaurants in South Korea and her native Philippines before coming to the U.S. eight years ago. She was a waitress at Dynasty Buffet for two-and-a-half years prior to Yang promoting her to manager.\n\nGilbert admitted her passion for cooking lies more in the front of the restaurant than in the kichen.\n\n\"I love to learn about the business,\" she said. \"When you learn something, it is experience for the next level. Also, I just like to eat.\"\n\nWhile Yang has only been an owner for a few months, his mission for Dynasty Buffet is absolute: that customers get great value for their time and money.\n\n\"I want to make them feel that it's worth it,\" he said. \"We have to make sure every single item is popular and everything is prepared properly.\"", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "2bf42f7a-545d-475e-8253-25442d8be3d4", "url": "http://www.houmatoday.com/article/20121212/ENTERTAINMENT/121219879/1275"}

Franzen's first two goals of the night, both on the power play, pushed Detroit's lead to 3-0.\n\n\"Our penalty kill has just got to do a better job,\" Avs forward David Jones said. \"Every time we take a penalty, they're scoring.\"\n\n\"You get down a couple of goals to this team, it's a tough chore to come back,\" Avalanche coach Joe Sacco said. \"I think we're frustrated right now.

She helped establish Main Street Joplin and the Joplin Historic Preservation Commission. Joplin\n\nThis is the second half of our brief history on the cyclones, tornadoes and twisters that Mother Nature has visited upon Joplin in the past. You can find the first part by clicking here.\n\nIn the summer of 1908, a small \"funnel-shaped cloud dipped down out of the sky\" just southwest of Joplin in the early morning. The tornado swept across an area estimated at a quarter of a mile in diameter and destroyed four mining plants: the Ruth, Eden, and Haggerty plants, plus one unnamed plant. Mrs. Jack Armil, who lived in Joplin Heights, told a reporter that she thought she was going to lose her house to the tornado. Although she and her home escaped unscathed, her landscaping was badly damaged. The twister did not raise much alarm in Joplin proper as the Globe failed to report on the event, leaving the News-Herald to publish a brief article noting the tornado's brief appearance.\n\nThe next few years were quiet until the spring of 1911. On a fine spring evening a powerful rainstorm with heavy winds hit the area between north Joplin and south Webb City. The storm, prior to its arrival in Joplin, had already left a trail of devastation across Oklahoma and Kansas. Fortunately, casualties were light. Mrs. Almedia Shelley was killed when her home on Smelter Hill was destroyed by what was described as a \"high wind.\" Others were injured, including: T.J. Walten, Charles Vancourt, Claude Hankins, and a man named Adkins.\n\nSeveral decades passed before Joplin was once again in the path of a tornado. On the evening of May 5, 1971, Joplin experienced its first significant tornado. Tornado sirens reportedly did not go off in time until the funnel was on the ground, catching many residents by surprise. The twister tore through the city causing damage along thirty-seven city blocks and took the life of Missouri Southern student Rick Johnson. Johnson was killed at his residence at the Anderson Mobile Trailer Court on Newman Road. His wife miraculously survived. The event was memorialized in a booklet succinctly titled, The Joplin Tornado. You can view the entire booklet online courtesy of the Joplin Public Library here: \n\nTwo years later, on the morning of May 11, 1973, another tornado hit Joplin with winds roared through the city at an estimated 70 to 100 miles an hour. Mrs. Lea Kungle, head of Jasper County's civil defense, told a Globe reporter, \"They say you can't have a hurricane here, but it was like a hurricane.\"\n\nThree residents were killed, over one hundred were injured, an estimated one thousand trees blown over, and at least $20 million in property damage. The West Side Trailer Court on West Seventh Street sustained heavy losses. Mrs. Roger Wisdom, who lived at the trailer court, remarked that \"The sky was so black, and it seemed to come to a point and looked like it was coming in on you…it was so big.\" A ten year old girl, Chris Day, woke up flying through the air on her mattress. She survived without any serious injuries.\n\nJust as sudden as it had arrived, the tornado quickly moved eastward, not to be surpassed in the history of the city until May 22, 2011.\n\nWhat the \"saved\" process entails is the sorting and categorizing of the negatives, which involves documenting the names of the individual in the photographs that date from 1939 to 1986. This will be done by the Museum Complex's volunteers, who museum director Brad Belk notes in the article, \"have never done anything like this…\" and will have to create a database to allow for easy search and distribution. In the end, Joplin residents who lost photographs might be able to find replacement photographs within this collection. Belk stated he hoped that the process would take only three months. We expect this is an optimistic timeline given the lack of experience of the JMC staff, despite having an extensive collection of historic photographs of Joplin. What the JMC should do is reach out to the State Archives staff that Secretary of State Robin Carnahan has sent to Joplin. The State Archives have extensive experience in the sorting, cataloging, restoration and preservation of photographs, particularly those that have suffered damage.\n\nWe're happy to know that the negatives were not lost and an effort will be made to catalog and document this important part of Joplin's history. We do hope that when the Mosler collection has been fully cataloged that it's contents will be made available to the public at large.\n\nI am having a difficult time knowing what to say. In fact, I hesitate to even write anything about brick and mortar, when human life, hopes, and dreams are what really matter. However, since I have written so much about Joplin's architecture through the years, I feel compelled to say something. I have had several CNN reporters contact me for interviews, but I have not wanted to talk to them. First of all, I had not personally seen all the damage. It is impossible to get around, and I did not want to get in the way of emergency workers nor be a voyeur. Secondly, I just did not think I could articulate what has happened to my beloved Joplin. So now I will attempt some general (and unofficial) impressions of Joplin's historic identity and how this incomprehensible tragedy has affected it. Also, rather than catalog specific buildings that have been lost, I will focus on three historic residential areas.\n\nI begin with the historic town of Blendville in southwest Joplin, which was established in 1876 as \"Cox Diggings.\" The prosperous little community incorporated as Blendville, so-named because of the huge amounts of zinc blende in the ground. Thomas Cunningham owned the residential area, which he divided into lots and sold at low rates so that miners could afford their own homes. The city of Joplin extended its streetcar line to Blendville, with lines going south on Main to 19th Street, west to Byers, south to 21st Street, west to Murphy, then south to 26th. In 1892, Joplin annexed the village. Thomas Cunningham donated \"Cunningham Grove\" as Joplin's first city park. The tornado took out most of the original Blendville area, including Cunningham Park and the historic water plant with some of the original equipment preserved inside.\n\nThe next area of historic significance is \"Schifferdecker's First Addition\", a residential area developed in south Joplin beginning in 1900. The Joplin Globe referred to the area lying south of 20th Street and fronting on Wall, Joplin, and Main Street as \"a beautiful new addition affording the most desirable building property\" to be found anywhere in the city. A second addition continued development south of 20th on Virginia, Kentucky, and Pennsylvania Avenues as well as along 21st, 22nd, and 23rd Streets to the east and west. The residential district continued to expand to the south throughout the teens, twenties, thirties. The homes in the region ranged from high Victorian styles to bungalows and eclectic Tudors, Colonial Revivals, Spanish mission, etc. Tragically, this charming old neighborhood has been wiped out.\n\nAfter World War II ended, Joplin families faced a housing shortage. Some Camp Crowder buildings were moved to Joplin, while others were dismantled to provide construction materials. Hundreds of small efficiency houses were mass-produced for veterans and financed through FHA. Many of these were built in the Eastmoreland area. As people prospered in the 1960s and 1970s, they built more substantial brick homes east and south of the new high school at 20th and Indiana. Although most people do not think of these homes as historic, they do have their own place in Joplin's architectural history, and their loss is devastating as well.\n\nEntire chapters of Joplin's history have been forever erased. I have not even touched on the loss of churches, schools, medical buildings, and businesses. Again, I am not relating the loss of our buildings to the loss of our people. Joplin will rebuild. It has already begun. During the first week after the tornado, I saw a business being rebuilt in the midst of the war zone surrounding West 26th Street!\n\nIn the wake of Joplin's tornado, homes were destroyed and the possessions within them literally scattered to the wind. While much that was lost, furniture or clothes, can be replaced in one way or another, photographs cannot. They are our way of capturing a moment in time be it a special event or simply the image of a loved one. If lost, there is no way to recapture with a camera that passing moment.\n\nOne such photographic horror story concerned the photographs of Murwin Mosler, who photographed Joplin and her people over a span of decades from the 1930s to the 1960s. Mosler's life work, organized into a collection, was lost when the tornado destroyed his daughter's home.\n\nSome are not willing to let these lost photographs remained lost as numerous facebook sites, such as Joplin's Found Photos, sprung up to attempt to reunite owners with their memories. In turn, a website, Joplin Rescued Photos, collects these links and offers to be a central location for the effort to save photographs and return them home. Joplin is not alone, either, as Operation Photo Rescue is on its way to the city sometime soon. Operation Photo Rescue consists of volunteers who will scan in damaged photographs, then digitally repair them and send the restored images to the owners for free.\n\nWhile the days have passed since the storm and the clean up well under way, keep an eye open to a bent piece of paper lodged beneath a branch, it might well be someone's memory and with the help of the people above, it might even find its way home.", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "9a56b579-4634-457c-92fe-f781abf8e04b", "url": "http://www.historicjoplin.org/?cat=1795"}
{"text": "Yeah, you read that right. But just to be clear, let me reiterate right from the get-go that this is strictly classified as a rumor. The rumor mill is churning this out, and that's it for right now. But if this turns out to be true, and for some reason I believe it may be, this is, well, huge. Not just for T-Mobile USA either, even though they're definitely taking up the majority of goodness out of this deal, if it comes to fruition. Truth be told, for the company who began the Android run here in the States, they deserve this device.\n\nOver at \"Tmo News\", David got a drop from one of his trusted ninja about what was being planned for T-Mobile. It looks like the carrier has landed the \"Google Phone\". Yes, at this point in time the Google Phone is still a #digitalunicorn, and hasn't even come close to an official announcement from anyone, let alone Google, but there's a slight addition to this that makes it all the more plausible. As code names go, Passion is one of the titles that's pretty high up in the rumor mill within the Android community, and let's face it, everyone wants this phone. The Google Phone that T-Mobile is supposedly getting has been hidden under the guise of \"Passion\". It's an entire project devoted to this device, and even better, it's apparently being launched within the first two weeks of January. That isn't too far off.\n\nHowever, the fact that the Google Phone has been reeking of VoIP services leaves one to question: why T-Mobile? Has Google worked out a deal with them to sell the phone, and have T-Mobile USA support it on its network? That seems a bit strange if it's true, but I guess stranger things have happened. And before I forget, let me just go over the quick nitty-gritty about the supposed HTC Passion (or Dragon, if you still want to call it that) so you can be just as excited all over again: a 1 GHz Snapdragon processor; 4.3-inch capacitive multi-touch touchscreen; 5MP camera with LED flash; Android 2.x; 3.5mm headset jack; and 512 MB ROM/ 256 MB RAM. And let me end this by saying that David over at Tmo News is a great guy, and he knows what he's talking about. He's also not one to just make stuff up, either. So, while we hope you take this with a grain of salt, we might see a big change coming here very, very soon. All those Verizon Wireless customers out there, what do you think of the fact that the Passion might not be coming to your network at all anymore?\n\n5 Comments\n\nAs a Droid owner, I think its fair that Tmo would get the Google phone… but I don't think it's fair for Google to make a phone anyway. If that's what they wanted to do they should have done that in the first place. All of these companies went out on a limb for Google in the beginning, risking their money to jumpstart Android. Google would undoubtedly have an advantage over any other company in designing a new phone. It isn't right for Google to swoop in when the hype is highest. /2cents\n\nI can see where you're coming from. Though, it was mainly T-Mobile USA that jumped on the Android platform, while the other companies all denied Google's presence within the mobile industry. Sprint's CEO Dan Hesse even went as far as saying that Android wasn't ready for Sprint, when it first came out (even six months later, he was still saying Sprint was too good for Android). So, yes, I agree that T-Mobile does indeed deserve this device, just for the fact they need a \"good\" Android device. (Please, no hate from the CLIQ users out there.)\n\npity it won't have a keyboard – we need a good device with a keyboard that can be used international – which is why i don't go with sprint or verizon (coz of CDMA issues overseas) let us wait and see… SAMMY\n\nTmobile is a horrible phone company. Their service is terrible. I have a tmobie g1 and I intermittently get 3G coverage (NJ). Verizon and sprint has much better 3G coverages then Tmo. Forget the 3G coverage, Verizon & Sprint have better regular cell phone signal then Tmo. So HTC passion should go to Verizon or Sprint.", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "649f5853-199b-45ff-943d-bc0152aaf2da", "url": "http://androinica.com/2009/12/rumor-mill-google-phone-heading-to-t-mobile-under-code-name-passion/"}

{"text": "They say \"There's never an off-week in the SEC\" and if there was ever a living, breathing embodiment of that statement, it'd be the South Carolina Gamecocks' October 2012 schedule. Two weeks ago Georgia came to town. Last Saturday, South Carolina visited LSU. And this week, are playing back-to-back Top 10 opponents, well, now they have to go to No. 3 Florida.\n\nGood times! Unless you're a South Carolina fan.\n\nFor the Gamecocks, Saturday could end up being the biggest game of the Steve Spurrier era in Columbia. A win gives them a stranglehold on the SEC East, and in turn will put them back into the BCS title hunt as well. A loss, and both dreams will essentially be vanquished.\n\nHere's what you need to know heading into the game.\n\nFor South Carolina to Win: They'll need a better effort from Connor Shaw than what they got from their quarterback last Saturday at LSU. In the Gamecocks loss to Tigers, Shaw completed just 19 of 34 passes for 177 yards, and tossed two interceptions, after throwing just two in the first five games of the season.\n\nMore than the stats though, Shaw simply didn't look comfortable in the pocket, and in turn South Carolina's offense didn't look comfortable because of it. A week after the Gamecocks put up 392 yards of total offense against Georgia, they put up barely put up half of that, with just 211 total yards.\n\nThat's not going to cut it against anyone, let alone against Florida, which owns one of the nation's Top 15 defenses.\n\nFor Florida to Win: They need to let Mike Gillislee loose! That's because while Gillislee doesn't have the best stats of any back in college football, he may have the most meaningful ones. In Florida's two biggest games, Gillislee (and to their credit, the offensive line) have been at their best, with the senior back rushing for 146 yards in Florida's upset win over LSU, after putting up 115 against Tennessee just a few weeks before.\n\nAnd on Saturday, Gillislee could be in line for another big performance. South Carolina has an excellent defensive front, but do appear to be vulnerable. They did allow LSU freshman Jeremy Hill to rush for 124 yards last week, after all.\n\nSpeaking of the running game…\n\nKey Player, South Carolina: Look, at this point, we know what we're going to get from South Carolina's defense (most likely \"very stellar play\") and as we learned last week, the Gamecocks can't rely solely on Connor Shaw to do it all by himself on the offensive side of the ball either. Meaning that on Saturday the running game is key, and with Marcus Lattimore banged up, it's also why back-up Kenny Miles is key.\n\nFor whatever reason (be it injury, game-plan, whatever), Lattimore was limited to just 13 carries last week nearly 10 below his average (22.7) in SEC play this year. In turn, he finished with a meager 35 yards rushing, a fraction of the 106 yards a game he's put up on average in conference play as well.\n\nLook for Steve Spurrier to try and establish the run early and often on Saturday. And it will likely come on the back of Kenny Miles.\n\nKey Player, Florida: Like every time they take the field, the fate of the offense (which in turn, almost always decides the fate of the game) is none other than Jeff Driskel. And given the way Driskel has played these last few weeks, that's good news for Florida fans.\n\nSimply put, in a year where young quarterbacks like Braxton Miller and Johnny Manziel have stolen headlines across college football, Driskel has been as important to his team's success as anyone. He's completing 67 percent of his passes, but more importantly, seems to be able to pick up big plays with his feet whenever his team needs them. Driskel's 177 yards and three touchdowns against Vanderbilt were the difference in a win, and upset loss on the road.\n\nGoing against a banged up South Carolina front seven Saturday, Driskel could be in for another big one.\n\nKey Stat: \"10,\" the number of fourth quarter points Florida allowed to Vanderbilt last weekend.\n\nSo why is that number important? Only because those 10 points was the only fourth quarter scoring Florida has allowed this season. That number is especially impressive considering the Gators have played two of college football's most prolific offenses in Texas A&M and Tennessee.\n\nNow, what does it mean for South Carolina? Only that if they play on winning this game, they better get their points early.\n\nLook for another classic game in the Swamp.\n\nFor all his articles, insight and analysis on college football, please follow Aaron on Twitter @Aaron_Torres", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "6ba61bfe-00ed-4b05-919f-69558baec1e1", "url": "http://thecomeback.com/crystalballrun/2012-articles/south-carolina-florida-2012.html"}

Not sure if this is related to the BIOS or if the slot has just died. After two stable years, the checksum error and one BSOD, I'm worried.\n\nPros: It had been a good board, more or less, for the last two years. Up until about a month ago, it has been stable. Had lots of room for expansion, and seemed to meet my needs for board with lots of SATA ports and expansion slots. Windows7, AMD FX-8350, 16 ram, Samsung 840 250 Gig system drive, Rosew...\n\nCons: Has always a problem with USB 3.0, cannot it to update drivers, either from internet or disk.

Tried to hold onto the on button to do a hard turnoff, but that didn't turn off the system.\n\nPros: - Exactly what I was looking for in a Mobo* - Despite the issues, the features of this mobo kept me with it *when it decided it was a good day for it to work right.\n\nCons: - Bios is finicky (I'd almost be willing to call it garbage) - Would have a variety of USB issues - Lasted me literally a day over 2 years\n\nBeen a Gigabyte girl for years\n\nSonya L., Newegg\n\n9 September 2015\n\nSummary: Finally have this system running stable using my old FX8350. Had to jump through hoops and make a call to AMD corporate to RMA my FX9590. However, AMD tells me that this board does not support the processor - but Gigabyte says it does... (someone's not on the same page).\n\nPros: It works I guess. Does work to an extent with FX9590 and BIOS FCh.\n\nCons: Since February I have been facing random lock ups...

What do you know, no bios on the board.\n\nIt's a good motherboard, but I'm having problems with it.\n\ndan, Amazon\n\n10 February 2015\n\nSummary: Its a solid motherboard. It runs great. The only problem I have is, my cpu is rated at 4.7 - 5.0 gh but it's running at 4.0 gh.

I will pay more for quality. The only reason it gets 2 stars instead of one is because it did work for more than a year w/o issue.\n\nCons: FAILS LIKE EVERY OTHER GIGABYTE BOARD IVE OWNED!!!

{"text": "Post navigation\n\nThe Granderson problem\n\nGranderson's struggles are palpable. His second half had these putrid numbers: .212/.278/.480. The Orioles' starter tonight is Joe Saunders, a left-handed pitcher. Granderson's strikeout rate the entire season against left-handers is 31.9 percent. And again, Granderson has struck out six times in this series in twelve plate appearances. It seems that Granderson is always in an 0-2 or 1-2 hole. It seems that he cannot stop himself from swinging at a ball outside the strike zone for the third strike. It seems that at this point of the proceedings, a Russell Martin plate appearance is much more appealing.\n\nSo what should Joe Girardi do? Andruw Jones is not on the roster, nor should be. And even with his struggles, Granderson drove in 56 runs in the second half and led the Yankees in that category for the season. Without him in the lineup, the Yankees do not seem so circular or scary. But with him in the lineup, there has been a black hole where his name is penciled in.\n\nGranderson's second half has already made his long-term viability for the Yankees seem to be a difficult equation. And that same conundrum exists in this series against the Orioles. The bottom line is that the only other options are to put Ibanez in left and Ichiro in center. But that weakens the defense and both are left-handed batters anyway. And Brett Gardner simply does not have enough game reps to consider losing Granderson's power possibilities from a risk standpoint.\n\nAs always, A-Rod is the lightning rod. But Curtis Granderson has been a non-entity in this series10 thoughts on \"The Granderson problem\"\n\nI've said this for a while now. I hope the Yankees do NOT offer him a long term deal. In fact If I'm the Yankees I let him walk after this year. Sign Ichiro for a year and go into the 2013 season with an outfield of: Gardner in CF, Ichiro in LF and Swisher in RF. Of course that means re-signing Swisher. Then in 2014 see if any of the highly touted outfield prospects for the Yankees are ready to take over for Ichiro.\n\nTo be fair, everyone outside of Jeter and Martin haven't been hitting this series. But at the very least, we are seeing them put the bat on the ball (minus A-rod, who has been striking out as well). I've complained about Granderson MANY times in the past, but this has to be the final straw. He's just not making contact and not even giving him or his team a shot by striking out. I'm sick of watching him come up to the plate and going back to the dugout 3 pitches later. I know Gardner doesn't have the reps, but i'm sure he'd be more willing to lay down a bunt and has the ability to slap a single. He's faster and could probably work a walk too. Granderson just doesn't deserve to be in their right now.\n\nExactly, Will. Granderson should be paying A-Rod for distracting everyone; if Alex wasn't so deep in his funk, more folks would have time to notice that Granderson isn't doing much better. If Rodriguez was even hitting to his average, folks would have time to notice that Granderson is hopeless – he looks like he did his first season, when Joe sat him down and Long worked his magic.\n\nTime to give it one more try – even if it means putting Gardner in. Or – at the very least, should we win tonite, have Long spend the next three days trying to fix Curtis. I saw the same game you did – Grandy seems happy to just swing three times and sit back down. I forget WHICH one it was, but in one ab, he swung over two gopher balls and then under the third offering – that was at lip level.\n\nCano was bad enough with his discipline last night; Granderson takes it to another level.\n\nReplace Grandy with Ibanez, a lefty who can actually make contact with the ball, move Ichiro to center and DH Nunez. This way you have Granderson on the bench to match up with a right hander if needed. Ibanez hurts a little with the glove, but Ichiro is better in center than the late breaking Granderson.", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "0339f2d0-660e-4081-b8e6-11d3b845eadf", "url": "http://itsaboutthemoney.net/archives/2012/10/11/the-granderson-problem/"}

With 24.9 CuFt of capacity, this Whirlpool WRS325FNAM side-by-side refrigerator offers the space you need to meet all your food storage needs.

It casts a more natural light on the contents of your refrigerator, while the Accu-Chill temperature management system cools food quickly and saves energy. Adaptive Defrost also saves more energy by monitoring when the compressor is running and defrosting only when necessary.\n\nI bought this 2 months ago and am so happy that we did. Freezer has more room area and the refrigerator area is good enough for us. We prefer not to have ice maker or water dispenser since we don't need both of these features. I heard they are one of causes of refrigerator repair and they used up space. So we are very happy to have this type of fridge which has no ice maker and water dispenser feature\n\nInstalled this about a month ago and it seems to be very nice. This is my first experience with a side-by-side. For the price, I wasn't sure how finger-print free the finish would be and was happily surprised to see that it is fingerprint resistant. Very good interior lighting and ample drawer space.\n\nI bought this a week ago. Prior to putting food in we tested it with multiple thermometer to get the internal temperature correct. We saw large swings in both the freezer and refrigerator temperatures. Whirlpool waranty service and they came out and notified us the compressor was bad, We returned it to where we bought it.\n\nHad a side by side many years ago. Really missed the extra freezer room when I bought one with a top freezer 5 years ago. We decided to finally go back to the side by side. Had to buy this one by only seeing it on-line. The store did not have it in stock, maybe because it does not have an ice maker, yes there are still people out there that do not want an ice maker/dispenser in the door. Got this at the end of Nov. Really like this. No problems with it and I was able to put a 20 pound turkey in the freezer, while they were on sale, and still have loads of freezer space. The refrigerator has plenty of space inside and in the door. So far, so good. I hope to have it as long or maybe longer then my last side by side that I had for 20 years.\n\nnot celebrate.....I feel like I have to crawl in the fridge since the door is so deep. Also the wire shelves in the freezer are not convenient! The store did not have one in stock so it was purchased sight unseen.\n\nWe have only had our refigerator 1 1/2 weeks but we find it has more room and it seems to run a lot less than our old on that was a Whirlpool also our repairman told us that our old one at 15 years was still running very well but it was time to change an to get anouther Whirlpool.", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "78d13603-3778-483b-bbed-f251a64e2338", "url": "http://www.brandsmartusa.com/Whirlpool/172205/25+0+CuFt+Side+By+Side+Refrigerator.htm"}

{"text": "Now Commenting On:\n\nYounger Papelbon aims to beat odds\n\nYounger Papelbon aims to beat odds\n\nNEW YORK -- In a way, it couldn't be more fitting that Josh Papelbon was taken at pick No. 1,443 (and round 48) in the First-Year Player Draft by the Red Sox on Wednesday.\n\nFor that draft slot alone is enough to make Jonathan Papelbon's brother an underdog before he throws his first pitch at the pro level.\n\nThe three Papelbons -- Jonathan and younger twins Josh and Jeremy (taken by the Cubs in Round 19) -- have been joined at the hip over the years. They have pursued their dreams as one, spurring each other on with competitive spirit.\n\n\"Out of the three of us brothers, he's always been the hardest worker out of all of us,\" Jonathan Papelbon said before Thursday's game against the Yankees. \"Nothing has really come easy to him, so he's always worked harder than both of us. The thing he's got going for him is he's a competitor, man. It doesn't matter who is up there, it doesn't matter who he's playing against, he thinks he can beat anybody.\"\n\nSo now Josh Papelbon will go about his quest of beating the odds. Players drafted with just two rounds to spare in a 50-round draft aren't usually destined for success at the Major League level.\n\nBut maybe Josh Papelbon, a submarine-style right-handed reliever, is different.\n\nAs the draft was getting later and later, the junior from the University of North Florida started wondering if he'd be back for his senior season, with the carrot being a promise from coach Dusty Rhodes that he could start.\n\n\"Oh, man, it's amazing,\" said Josh Papelbon. \"Towards the end, I started biting my nails, because I didn't really think it was going to happen. I'd already had plans to go to Alaska and play in a summer league. My coach had talked to me and said, 'If you don't get drafted, come back and start.' I was kind of looking forward to that, too, so I had two things.\"\n\nBut the thing that wound up happening was unquestionably more desirable. He is now in the same organization as his brother, who is having a phenomenal rookie season just three years after he was drafted by the Sox.\n\n\"I was just thinking about this today when I was working out and throwing,\" said Josh Papelbon. \"I was thinking, 'That's going to be really cool whenever I make it, I get my first inning under my belt, my first out or whatever, and I'm coming off the field and Jonathan is congratulating me,' because I'm always used to Jeremy, my twin brother, congratulating me and me congratulating him.\"\n\nJonathan Papelbon couldn't have been any happier to see both brothers get drafted on the same day. Jeremy is a left-handed starter who played college ball with Josh.\n\n\"I think he's the first left-hander the Cubs took in the draft,\" Jonathan Papelbon said. \"That's a great opportunity for him. He's got a lot of potential. He throws three, four pitches, all for strikes. He can go out there and knows how to compete. We all compete real well when we're out on the baseball field. We've all grown up together. We've just competed like ... whoever can finish their meal first gets seconds. That's just how it was. That's all we know. It's in our blood. It's instilled in us.\"\n\nThe Papelbon brothers have shared a clear bond in their climb to professional baseball.\n\n\"It's been great, especially because every offseason, all three of us have worked out together,\" Josh Papelbon said. \"We've made leaps and bounds in our talent and how we approach the game and how we can get better and things like that. All three of us have helped each other out.\"\n\nWhen Josh Papelbon was playing in a college wooden bat league in Lowell, Mass., last year, Jonathan set up a meeting for his brother to talk to another submariner: Chad Bradford, who was with the Red Sox at the time.\n\n\"I was able to get Chad to kind of sit down and talk shop with Josh,\" said Jonathan. \"That was kind of a real big eye opener for him -- he got to sit down and talk to him and see how it is.\"\n\nExpect Jonathan Papelbon to be a somewhat frequent presence at Minor League Spring Training in Fort Myers next February.\n\n\"Obviously, I can help him out with little things here and little things there and help him feel a lot more comfortable in the environment, because I know how it was. There's so many things going on and so many people in Spring Training, and this and that,\" Jonathan said.\n\n\"I'll be able to show him the ropes and give him pointers here and there and actually let him know how it works and how you're going to have to go out there and work your butt off to do what you have to do. He knows that. We talk a lot. There shouldn't be any surprises for him.\"\n\nAnd if Josh Papelbon does realize his dream of pitching alongside big brother amid the backdrop of Fenway Park, nobody will be less surprised than Jonathan Papelbon.\n\n\"He just wanted a chance to play ball, and I guess the Red Sox were willing and able to give him that chance,\" said Jonathan Papelbon. \"He'll do good. He can compete with anybody.\"\n\nIan Browne is a reporter for MLB.com.

MORAb-004 is a monoclonal antibody that specifically binds to endosialin/tumor endothelial marker-1 (TEM-1).\n\nThe trial is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to assess the efficacy and safety of single agent MORAb-004 plus best supportive care as determined by progression-free survival in patients with chemorefractory metastatic colorectal cancer. Secondary objectives include assessment of an overall survival benefit, identification of biomarkers to predict efficacy, and safety of single agent MORAb-004.\n\nMorphotek expects to enroll up to 160 patients in this study, which is being conducted at clinical centers in the United States. As part of the trial, patient tumors and plasma samples will be tested for endosialin/TEM-1 and/or proteins within its pathway to determine if the pattern of expression relates to or determines clinical effect. The goal of these investigations is to identify those patients who had a clinically meaningful response to MORAb-004.\n\n\"We are excited to have initiated this Phase II study of MORAb-004 in metastatic colorectal cancer,\" stated Christina Coughlin, M.D., Ph.D., Senior Director of Clinical Development at Morphotek. \"New agents are needed for the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer. The treatment of chemorefractory colorectal cancer remains an area of significant unmet medical need in the field of oncology. We are pleased to have the opportunity to collaborate with several key experts in this disease setting.\"\n\nMORAb-004 is a humanized monoclonal antibody specific for endosialin/TEM-1 protein. The target is found to be expressed on the cell surface of cells called pericytes that are part of the tumor blood vessel architecture, as well as on fibroblast cells that are part of the tumor stroma.

These account numbers and codes were purportedly obtained without the knowledge or consent of the trucking companies. It's claimed the individuals then provided the stolen account numbers and codes via telephone calls or text messages to the defendants, according to the indictment.\n\nThe U.S. Attorney's Office says the defendants traveled to truck stops in the Northern District of Ohio and elsewhere. Once at the truck stops, they posed as truck drivers, approached customer service counters, presented the stolen account numbers and codes, and requested checks from electronic fund processing companies, according to the indicment\n\nCustomer service representatives at the truck stops then processed the requests by sending the account numbers and codes via wire to EFP processing centers located outside the Northern District of Ohio.

You'll need to put some work in to fitting it but once on it's durable and comfy.\n\nIn the box you get the usual two lengths of tape, short finishing sections for behind the levers, tape and bar-end plugs. The tape is self-adhesive – though not very – and nicely padded, but one thing it isn't is flexible. You really need to be firm when you're fitting it to make sure it goes on nice and snug, beyond the point where you'd be snapping a normal tape and swearing at it. The striped design means you have to be a lot more careful to keep the wrap spacing even too, which is kind of annoying but also good practice.\n\nAnyway, once it's on it's grippy and comfortable and it looks very classy. It's pretty tough too, resisting scuffs well. It's a bit more absorbent than a standard tape in the rain but on the other hand grip isn't affected so much by its being wet. All in all it's a good product; it's not a cheap option but definitely one to look at for your good bike.\n\nVerdict\n\nComfy, durable and classy tape.

We ended up using the free parking and taking the train into Munich. The train station is about 1km walk from the hotel. 6.4€ for a day ticket allowed us to use the S-Bahn and U-Bahn all day.\n\nBad Aibling Hotel Guide\n\nIf you intend to stay in Bad Aibling, book your room as early as you can, as you won't find a lot of lodging options close to Bad Aibling's heart.\n\nThe Hotel St Georg is amongst the most conveniently situated options as it is one of only a small number of options within an easy stroll of the Bad Aibling downtown area.\n\nThe Althoff Seehotel Überfahrt is 16 miles away from the heart of Bad Aibling. Another alternative is the Das Tegernsee Hotel & Spa, which is situated 15 miles away. Another possibility is to book a room at the Hotel Bachmair Weissach or the Brauereigasthof-Hotel Aying.\n\nLooking to venture a bit further afield? Upper Bavaria has many things to see. Upper Bavaria has forests and rivers, and commonly visited Upper Bavaria tourist destinations include castles and old towns. Visitors and locals alike in this section of Germany can enjoy snowboarding, skiing and cross-country skiing.\n\nRosenheim is 6 miles to the west of Bad Aibling and is where you'll find Culture and Congress Centre Rosenheim, Church of St. Nikolaus and Staedtisches Museum. The Hotel San Gabriele and TRYP by Wyndham Rosenheim are a few of the great lodging options in Rosenheim. Or, you could consider staying in Bad Wiessee, 18 miles to the northeast of Bad Aibling, where you can choose from the Hotel Garni Am Kureck and Hotel Alpensonne. The Casino Bad Wiessee and Iodine Sulphur Springs are a couple of the more popular sites to explore should you visit Bad Wiessee.\n\nGarmisch-Partenkirchen is home to around 26,000 people, and is situated 50 miles northeast of Bad Aibling. A few local attractions worth visiting include the Partnach Gorge, Garmisch-Classic Ski Resort and Casino Garmisch-Partenkirchen There are a nice selection of hotels and accommodations here that that suit most tastes and budgets. Popular options include: the Reindl's Partenkirchner Hof, Riessersee Hotel Resort and H+ Hotel Alpina Garmisch-Partenkirchen. Other accommodation choices include: the Wittelsbacher Hof Swiss Quality Hotel and Best Western Hotel Obermuehle.\n\nBefore you head home from Upper Bavarian Alps and Lakes, make sure you experience some sport.

I'll be OK,\" she said. \"I want to thank my supporters for all the hard work they did to try and help me.\"\n\nDaniels will retain her seat, officially, until the Oakland County Board of Canvassers meets and certifies election results. The next Troy City Council meeting is scheduled for Nov. 12.\n\n\"The board has two weeks to complete the process,\" said Joe Rozell, director of elections for Oakland County. \"Typically something like that would take less than a week.\"\n\nDaniels' recall does not prohibit her from running for elected office in Troy in upcoming elections, Rozell said.\n\nThere will be no special election to fill the vacancy on the council.\n\nTroy City Clerk Aileen Bittner explained that the council will declare the seat vacant, then the mayor pro tem will be sworn in as mayor until the council appoints a new mayor.\n\nThe City Council will be required to appoint a mayor within 30 days after the Oakland County Board of Canvassers certifies results.\n\nIf a council member wishes to be appointed as mayor, he or she must submit a letter of resignation as council member to the City Clerk's office.\n\nIf more than one council member submits a letter of resignation because he or she wishes to be appointed mayor, the resignations of those not appointed would stand, Bittner said.\n\nShe added that there would likely be deliberations at the council table to ensure that multiple resignations would not occur. A vacant City Council seat would be filled by appointment, and that term and the mayoral term would expire in November of 2013.\n\nAccording to campaign finance reports turned into the Oakland County Elections Division Oct. 26, the group directing the effort to recall Daniels outspent Daniels and her supporters by 3-to-1.\n\nMatt Binkowski, who organized the effort to recall Daniels said he decided to do so after Daniels read a 20-minute position paper opposing the transit center and critical of then-City Manager John Szerlag into the public record at a City Council meeting this past January.\n\n\"It feels good to do something the city of Troy responded so positively to,\" said John Kulesz, who also spearheaded the recall effort.\n\nFormer Troy Mayor Louise Schilling said she saw enthusiasm to recall Daniels building as the signatures on recall petitions were collected. A Democrat, she lost her bid to serve as county commissioner for the 11th District to incumbent Republican Robert Gosselin.\n\nTroy resident Jeff Schaeper, who supported Daniels and described himself as a tea party member, said Daniels was successfully putting Troy's fiscal house in order.\n\n\"It's too short a time,\" he said of the effort to recall her. \"They are trying to short circuit the process.\"\n\nRozell said that over last the couple decades, recall questions in Oakland County made it onto ballots four times — of Pontiac Mayor Willie Payne in 2003, which was unsuccessful; in Keego Harbor for a council member in 1998, which was successful; and for two council members in Keego Harbor in 2001, which were successful. Another push to recall the Pontiac mayor this year failed after election officials rejected a number of signatures on the petitions.\n\n\"We see a lot of individuals come in and get ballot language approved in order to circulate petitions,\" Rozell said. \"But it's very rare that someone brings in the signatures to trigger an election", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "c64815b9-9f36-4bc8-abe3-41cdfe0300b5", "url": "http://www.candgnews.com/news/troy-mayor-recalled"}

{"text": "Replace whole roof or half roof??\n\nWe have had very bad wind and rain storms here last week and they took about 10 shingles off our roof front and back (mostly front of house) When we had a roofer look up on the roof he told us the front was soft and beveled wavy looking. He asked if our attic was finished and I told him yes and please have a look in the eves as years ago someone not sure who told us that the people before us that finished the attic over insulated it. He looked in the eves and removed the insulation in the area where the roof looked the worse and white mold and wet rotten plywood was on the front of the house. The rafters are stained and insulation wet. He said we need new plywood and roof in the front of house but the back seemed ok but not 100% as that side is also insulated the same way but when he took out one sheet of insulation that plywood seemed fine but really can't tell by one piece removed. He suggested replace front of house with 25 year shingle and new playwood and he would take out all the insulation in the ceiling part of the attic and put in something else but forget what it was he said. Or he could replace the whole roof with 25 front and back but only buy new plywood for the front as he did not feel the back really needed it. The issue is 10 years ago we had wind damage and had a roofer come out and put another 15 year roof over the old so now both layers will have to come off.\nWas this the wrong thing to do 10 years ago and could this contribute to leaking issues and adding the issue that the attic was over insulated 20 years ago be adding to all this problem?? Will try to submit to homeowners but have no idea what they will cover of this.. Should we do half or whole roof at this point????The only thing it is a 15 year roof that was put on 10 years ago on top of a old 15 year roof. I do not know how many more we will get out of the back roof anyway.. I still think the roof is leaking somewhere in addition to poor circulation issues. I could be wrong but the back on the house gets the afternoon sun most of the day so I would think that would be were the poor circulation would be more so then front. After that nasty wind and rain storm the shingles started coming off so I am sure stong winds had so issue here also!! I am glad we had a few shingles blow off as otherwise we would have never called a roofer out and never saw the mold and wet plywood issue.. We did notice the roof getting wavey in the front of the house after the storm but not before so not sure if missing shingles just made us look more at the roof or if if started after the wind and rain storms.. Anyway thanks for the info!!\n\nIMHO if this were mine; strip the whole thing,dump insulation,replace any sheathing damage, new roof entirely. If you dont you will regret it much sooner than you think and it wil cost way way more than just doing whole thing now\n\nMore than likely, due to the insulation being so tightly packed in each of the rafter bays, the wet insulation and plywood you discovered, (through the proper diligence of your roofer knowing to look for it), and also due to not having continuous intake and exhaust air flow to ventilate the spaces, the entire moisture problem is insulation and ventilation related.\n\nThe reroof 10 years ago did not create this situation.\n\nThe plywood on any side that the insulation is completely packed too tight in must be removed, even if only one side is showing the effects now, the other one will down the road.\n\nThe wet and moldy insulation should be removed and replaced with new. On top of the insulation, you need to have insulation baffle vent chutes installed.\n\nAt the bottom eave edge of the roof, either the entire soffit needs continuous length strip intake ventilation, or install Smart Vent, by DCI Products, to provide fresh air intake under the first courses of shingles.\n\nIn the top of the roof, it will need a full length of ridge vent, and I recommend the Shingle Vent II made by the Air Vent Corp.\n\nAlso, you should \"STRONGLY\" consider putting on at least a 30 year architectural style shingle instead of a cheap thin 25 year shingle.\n\nOne final note, gable vents will not work at all in your roof design, because of the enclosed rafter bays. It is not an open attic area, so that information previously provided was incorrect.", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "f97f473d-9c40-42d4-acd8-ef0e08532fe1", "url": "http://www.diychatroom.com/f9/replace-whole-roof-half-roof-18551/"}

{"text": "The opinion of the court was delivered by: Joe Billy Mcdade United States District Judge\n\nOPINION & ORDER\n\nBefore the Court is Defendants' Motion to Transfer Venue, filed on August 25, 2008 (Doc. 9). For the reasons stated below, the motion is GRANTED. This case is transferred to the United States District Court for the Southern District of Mississippi, Hattiesburg Division.\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nPlaintiff, as guardian of a disabled person who was severely injured in an onthe-job forklift accident, filed suit in this Court on June 25, 2008 (Doc. 1). On June 30, 2008, Magistrate Judge Gorman issued an Order indicating that, after a review of the Complaint, it appeared that this lawsuit bore no connection whatsoever to the Central District of Illinois (Doc. 4). In that Order, Judge Gorman directed Plaintiff to explain his selection of venue. In compliance with the June 30 Order, Plaintiff filed a brief in support of his venue selection on July 10, 2008 (Doc. 5). On July 15, 2008, Judge Gorman entered an Order allowing the case to proceed in this Court but notifying Plaintiff that the Court may revisit the issue of venue (Doc. 7). On August 25, 2008, Defendants filed a Motion to Transfer Venue, requesting a transfer of this action to the United States District Court for the Southern District of Mississippi, Hattiesburg Division (Doc. 9). Plaintiff's response to this motion was due by September 11, 2008. Plaintiff did not file and has not filed a response.\n\nANALYSIS\n\nThe parties agree that venue is proper in the Central District of Illinois pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391. Defendants operate scrap metal processing yards that are located in Peoria and Quincy, Illinois. Therefore, Defendants reside in this federal judicial district for purposes of the venue statute. However, the Court finds that, as a practical matter, this case is more appropriately decided in the Southern District of Mississippi, Hattiesburg Division.\n\nUnder 28 U.S.C. § 1404(a), a district court may transfer a civil action, \"[f]or the convenience of parties and witnesses, in the interest of justice\" to any other district or division where the plaintiff could have originally filed suit. In order for a district court to transfer a civil action to another venue, three requirements must be met: (1) venue must be proper in the transferor district; (2) venue and jurisdiction must be proper in the transferee district; and (3) the transfer must serve the convenience of the parties and witnesses and must generally promote justice. See Plotkin v. IP Axess, Inc., 168 F. Supp.2d 899, 902 (N.D. Ill. 2001). Although the decision to transfer venue is within the sound discretion of the district court, the party seeking a transfer bears the burden of demonstrating that the transferee forum is clearly more convenient. Id.; Coffey v. Van Dorn Iron Works, 796 F.2d 217, 220 (7th Cir. 1986).\n\nAs noted above, venue is proper in this, the transferor judicial district. Venue is also proper in the Southern District of Mississippi, Hattiesburg Division, which is the proposed transferee division. Plaintiff could have originally filed this action in the Southern District of Mississippi, Hattiesburg Division because that court has personal jurisdiction over Defendants*fn1 and because the events giving rise to the instant suit occurred in one of Defendants' processing yards located at 600 East Sixth Street in Hattiesburg, Mississippi. (Defs.' Ex. A, Shemper Aff. ¶ 2); 28 U.S.C. § 1391(a). Therefore, the first two requirements for a transfer of venue are satisfied.\n\nWhether the third requirement is met requires the Court to consider the following factors: (a) the plaintiff's choice of forum; (b) the situs of events giving rise to the suit; (c) ease of access to evidence; (d) convenience of the parties and witnesses. Plotkin, 168 F. Supp.2d at 902. Among these factors, the plaintiff's choice of forum is accorded substantial weight if it is also the plaintiff's home forum.\n\nId. However, the plaintiff's forum choice is accorded less deference if the selected forum is not the plaintiff's home forum. Id.\n\nThe Central District of Illinois is not Plaintiff's home forum. Moses Trejo resides in Cook County, Illinois, which county is encompassed by the Northern District of Illinois. (Compl. ¶ 1-2). It appears that Alfonso Trejo also resides in Cook County. (Compl. ¶ 18; Def.'s Mtn to Transfer Venue ¶ 3). In his Brief in Support of Venue, Plaintiff points out that relevant medical providers and medical records are located in Illinois. But Plaintiff does not indicate to the Court that these potential witnesses and documents are located in the Central District of Illinois. Accordingly, consideration (a) cuts against Plaintiff's choice of venue.\n\nThe forklift accident that is at the core of this dispute occurred at Defendants' scrap metal processing yard in Hattiesburg, Mississippi. (Compl. ¶¶ 13-15). Virtually all of the eye-witnesses to the event reside in or near Hattiesburg. (Shemper Aff. ¶ 13). Many other pieces of potentially relevant evidence, including medical records from a period of Plaintiff's hospitalization that occurred immediately after the forklift accident, are located in Hattiesburg. (Shemper Aff. ¶¶ 14-17). Accordingly, the remaining considerations, (b), (c), and (d) also cut against Plaintiff's choice of venue.\n\nThis Court's decision to transfer venue would likely be different if the Central District of Illinois were Plaintiff's home forum. It appears, from the information provided to the Court, however, that Plaintiff's home forum is the Northern District of Illinois. Frankly, the Court is perplexed as to why Plaintiff did not file suit in that district. Nonetheless, the Court does not believe that it will be unduly burdensome for Plaintiff to litigate this matter in the Southern District of Mississippi, Hattiesburg Division. If Plaintiff did find it extraordinarily difficult to litigate this case in Mississippi, he would have likely indicated as much in a response to Defendants' Motion to Transfer Venue. Plaintiff, however, did not file a response.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nIn the Court's discretion, and for the reasons stated above, this case is hereby transferred to the United States District Court for the Southern District of Mississippi, Hattiesburg Division.\n\nCASE TERMINATED.\n\nEntered this 24th day of November", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "800ed5d0-7990-4637-a12f-b2e0e504fba5", "url": "http://il.findacase.com/research/wfrmDocViewer.aspx/xq/fac.20081124_0000370.CIL.htm/qx"}

The brothers are the sons of the legendary high school coach Bob Hurley, Sr.\n\nName aside, this is a good hire for Buffalo, who finished 14-20 overall, 7-9 in the Mid-American Conference and lost to Kent State in the MAC tournament this season. While he hasn't been the face of the programs he's been at, many have been praising Hurley's ability to teach while under his brother. His name still resonates with a lot of high school coaches — and some players, I'd assume — from his days as Duke's point guard, winning two national titles, garnering all-America honors and leaving the Blue Devils as the NCAA Division I all-time leader in assists.\n\nIt's also a low-risk job for Hurley. The Bulls have had a decent amount of success recently, but have been mid-pack in the MAC at best. A lot of the buzz around the program is attributed to the talents of Mitchell Watt and Javon McCrea. If Hurley can convince McCrea to stick around for his senior season — he averaged 18 points and 7.9 rebounds this season — he might have the roster (only two seniors on this year's team) to immediately contend in the MAC", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "4bf8757e-7e59-412c-8d6c-0ad588fd1406", "url": "http://collegebasketball.nbcsports.com/2013/03/26/report-buffalo-hires-bobby-hurley-as-next-coach/related/"}

{"text": "The Osaki OS4000T reflects the same stylish and contemporary design as many of the other Osaki massage chairs, but has a few enhancements. The zero gravity is still a primary feature, but the 4000 has 46 airbags instead of 25, located primarily in the hip/thigh and upper arm areas, along with mechanical foot rollers...a very popular feature for massage chair buyers. It also boasts a \"Stretch\" program as well as a low back heating element. Body scan technology takes into account your body and spinal contours and caters it's massage to your body shape.\n\nReviews (16)\n\n4.94\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\nI and my wife have been wanting to buy a massage chair. When we decided to buy, we researched on different brands and models. Based on reviews and our budget, we decided to buy OSAKI OS-4000T. That's only one part of the process. The next process is to find where to buy it from. After comparing different online stores including Amazon, we agreed that the support and good customer service of massage-chair-relief.com based on the experiences and reviews of other people is outstanding enough to go and buy the massage chair from them.\n\nAnd we were not disappointed. Dr. Alan Weidner helped us through the process and was easy to contact by phone whenever we have questions.\n\nThe massage chair arrived as we expected. It is awesome to have a massage chair whenever we need it. It helped me sleep better. As matter of fact, my wife fell asleep on it and I didn't wake her up. I particularly liked the \"Swedish\" function combined with the calves. On the programmed sequence, I used the \"anti-stress\" button more often than not. This particular OS-4000T model has foot roller, which is useful after a long hours of work.\n\nAll in all, it is a good buy. I have been using the chair for a while now at least 30 minutes a day and my wife uses it more often than I.\n\nThanks to Dr. Alan Weidner for his constant communication and outstanding customer service.\n\nWe recently purchased the Osaki 4000T from MassageChairRelief.com. The buying experience went well, we even received a phone call from Dr. Weidner, commenting on the Osaki 4000T. The delivery and setup went less smoothly, in that we ordered the white glove service but the freight company unexpectedly dropped it off at our front door. Fortunately we were home and the driver was kind enough to bring it into the house. The driver indicated that it was a common experience for him to deliver a chair to a bewildered customer who expected him to set it up for them. A phone call to Dr. Weidner got things back on track and someone came to install it several days later. The chair itself satisfies our main criteria of delivering a relatively gentle roller massage that doesn't aggravate the bad spots in my lower back, and we are generally happy with it. By massage chair standards the Osaki 4000T is a fairly inexpensive chair, so we are willing to cut it some slack in the feature department, but it does have a couple of annoying characteristics: At the ends of each massage, it lets out five loud beeps and returns to the upright position, effectively preventing you from taking a nap; and the housing for the shoulder air bags is awkwardly placed, preventing us from comfortably inserting our arms into the arm massage housing, and effectively turning the arm massager into a little finger massager. But, we would still call it a pretty good chair.\n\nMy wife and I ordered this chair from Massage chair relief a few weeks ago after sitting in numerous chairs to try them out. This chair had all that we wanted and needed, and with just enough pressure. It was also one of the least expensive chairs we looked at….great! I spoke to Dr. Weidner about the 4000T chair and he had only good things to say about it. Well, we were sold, and we bought it online from Massage chair relief. We purchased the white glove service, and was happy we did. The chair came in about 7 days and was fully set up and functioning for us.\nWe LOVE this chair. It is awesome. My wife and I sit in it for 15 min. every other day each and it is a great pleasure to do so. It hits all the spots for us and is very relaxing. It is easy to pick programs or settings we like. We love it and have no regrets.\nThank you Dr. Weidner and staff for such an easy, seamless experience.\n\nI recently purchased an OS-Osaki 4000T massage chair from massage-chair-relief. Due to the west coast dock strike the delivery of my chair was delayed. During this time Dr. Alan Weidner was in constant contact with me and even offered to refund my money if I didn't want to wait it out. Osaki offered to give its customers a one year extended warranty and a free foot massager. I accepted their offer and I am very pleased with the foot massager. I finally received my massage chair and I am extremely satisfied with the chair and especially with Dr. Alan Weidner and his company. I would recommend anyone wanting to buy a massage chair on line to use Dr. alan Weidner and Massage Chair Relief. I would give the OS-Osaki 4000T a 5 star rating and more importantly Dr. Alan Weidner and his company a 10 Star rating. Their customer service is fantastic. Dr. Alan Weidner can be reached by phone and usually answers when you call or if you leave a message he gets back to you very quickly. He also answers e-mails and addresses all concerns promptly. Richard Parady, Port Charlotte, FL\nYou have my permission to use this testimony.\n\nBeing very new to on line purchases and being leery of anything that sounds to good to be true, I must admit that I am happy, but more importantly than that , very impressed ! From the initial contact with Mr.Weidner answering all my questions, to the service, delivery and ENJOYING this fantastic chair, it does everything as promised and more !\nI have some limitations with arms ,legs and an ankle, and it helps tremendously !\nIf you are considering buying a Osaki message chair and want value, I highly recommend this chair. Want a company that truly goes the extra mile with exceptional service, value and top this off with honesty and a hands on owner who is sincerely interested in your health………..

{"text": "Outsourcing Services to USA\n\nOutsourcing is a hot topic in the USA today. Even with millions of jobs being outsourced, and cost savings amounting to billions of dollars, there is still no clear outcome on whether outsourcing has been accepted by the general populace or not. Till date, outsourcing is a frightening proposition to many people. But still, its overall effect on the American economy cannot be ignored.\n\nOutsourcing has enabled organizations across both public and private sectors to achieve their business objectives faster and focus on their core competencies while mitigating business risks and adding value to their offerings. The global market size of outsourced services touched 104.6 billion US dollars in 2014, with the US accounting for almost 60% of the outsourced services.\n\nWith the number of employers joining the outsourcing bandwagon by the day, Asian countries, and especially India, have seen their economies soar because of the value proposition they offer. 59% of the world's employers now employ Indian workers, and 22% of the US companies who have never outsourced before say they have plans to move at least some segments of their business offshore to India.\n\nOutsource2india - Providing Service Outsourcing to the USA for the Past 17 Years\n\nAt O2I, we have been at the forefront of providing value-added outsourcing services to the USA and other countries, helping our clients improve processes, reduce workload, and more importantly, save millions of dollars in costs.

{"text": "[¶1] In this dependency and neglect proceeding concerning M.C.S., the Jefferson County Division of Children, Youth, and Families (Division) appeals from a juvenile court order dismissing its petition for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction. We affirm.\n\nI. Factual and Procedural Background\n\n[¶2] The Division filed a dependency and neglect petition concerning M.C.S. after it received a report that he was discharged from a teen shelter for possessing a pellet gun. He did not want to return home, and his father did not want him to return home. At that time, M.C.S. was only four months away from his eighteenth birthday. M.C.S.'s father appeared at an advisement hearing, entered a general denial, and requested that the matter be set for a jury trial. Because the attorney for M.C.S.'s father was not available during the ninety-day statutory period prescribed for adjudications ( see § 19-3-505(3), C.R.S. 2013), the court set the case for a jury trial after M.C.S. turned eighteen.\n\n[¶3] The Division, joined by M.C.S.'s guardian ad litem (GAL), moved for summary judgment on its petition. M.C.S.'s father responded, denying that he had refused to pick up M.C.S. from the shelter or assessment center, was afraid of M.C.S., or that M.C.S. was beyond his control. He also moved to dismiss, asserting that because M.C.S. would not be adjudicated before he turned eighteen, the juvenile court lacked jurisdiction to enter a disposition.\n\n[¶4] The juvenile court ruled on the motions after M.C.S.'s eighteenth birthday. The court found that its jurisdiction terminated when M.C.S. turned eighteen without having been adjudicated dependent and neglected, and that no statute or case law allowed its jurisdiction to continue. The court, therefore, granted father's motion to dismiss and found the Division's summary judgment motion moot.\n\n[¶5] The Division appeals from the dismissal. The GAL has filed a response in support of the Division's petition on appeal and joins in requesting that the dismissal be reversed.\n\nII. No Jurisdiction for Adjudication\n\n[¶6] The Division contends that the juvenile court erred when it determined that it no longer had jurisdiction after M.C.S. turned eighteen without having been adjudicated dependent and neglected. We disagree.\n\nA. Relevant Statutes\n\n[¶7] The Colorado Children's Code (Code) confers exclusive original jurisdiction in the juvenile court over proceedings \" [c]oncerning any child who is neglected or dependent, as set forth in section 19-3-102.\" § 19-1-104(1)(b), C.R.S. 2013; see also People in Interest of A.H., 271 P.3d 1116, 1120 (Colo. App.\n2011).\n\nPage 362\n\nUnless the context of the Code requires otherwise, the term \" 'c]hild'\" means \" a person under eighteen years of age.\" § 19-1-103(18), C.R.S. 2013.\n\n[¶8] A court may authorize the filing of a dependency and neglect petition only when \" a child is or appears to be within the court's jurisdiction.\" § 19-3-501(1)(b), C.R.S. 2013. The petition is the initial pleading and operates as a request for the court to take jurisdiction. People in Interest of H.A.C., 198 Colo. 260, 263, 599 P.2d 881, 883 (1979). A juvenile court's subject matter jurisdiction is based on the allegations of a child being neglected or dependent, and once a petition has been filed, the juvenile court may issue temporary orders. § 19-1-104(3)(a); see also A.H., 271 P.3d at 1120. However, the court's authority to issue temporary orders is limited to the period prior to adjudication or disposition of the child's case. A.H., 271 P.3d at 1120.\n\n[¶9] After a child has been adjudicated, the court gains authority to order extensive and flexible dispositional remedies, including placement of the child with or without protective supervision and in or out of the home. People in Interest of A.M.D., 648 P.2d 625, 639 (Colo. 1982). The court retains continuing jurisdiction over any child who has been adjudicated as neglected and dependent until the child becomes twenty-one unless jurisdiction terminates earlier by court order. § 19-3-205(1), C.R.S. 2013.\n\nB. Discussion\n\n[¶10] The Division asserts that once subject-matter jurisdiction properly vested in the juvenile court through the filing of the dependency and neglect petition, it could not be divested on or after M.C.S.'s eighteenth birthday. In support, the Division points to the absence of any Code provision that specifically terminates the court's jurisdiction when a child, who is subject to a dependency and neglect petition, turns eighteen before being adjudicated. It further relies on section 19-3-205(1) to argue that the dependency and neglect statutory scheme actually contemplates the continuation of subject-matter jurisdiction through adjudication and disposition, at least until the subject \" child\" reaches twenty-one. We are not persuaded by the Division's arguments and conclude, instead, that the juvenile court correctly determined from the relevant statutes that it no longer had jurisdiction after M.C.S.'s eighteenth birthday.\n\n[¶11] Statutory construction is a question of law, subject to de novo review. People in Interest of O.C., 2012 COA 161, ¶ 18, 312 P.3d 226.\n\n[¶12] When we interpret statutes, we must give effect to the intent of the legislature and adopt the construction that best effectuates the purposes of the statutory scheme. People in Interest of H., 74 P.3d 494, 495 (Colo. App. 2003). We also must presume that the legislature intended a just and reasonable result and avoid a statutory interpretation that would lead to an absurd result. Id.\n\n[¶13] We first look to the language of the statutes and give words their plain and ordinary meanings. O.C., ¶ 19. When the language of a statute is clear and unambiguous, we apply it as written. People in Interest of A.V., 2012 COA 210, ¶ 24, 297 P.3d 1019. Because the language of a particular statutory provision must be read in the context of the entire statutory scheme, any interpretation should give consistent, harmonious, and sensible effect to all parts of a statute. See People in Interest of N.G., 2012 COA 131, ¶ 24, 303 P.3d 1207. We resort to other principles of statutory construction only if we determine that a statute is ambiguous. See In re Parental Responsibilities of M.D.E., 2013 COA 13, ¶ 10, 297 P.3d 1058.\n\n[¶14] As the Division maintains, a court's acquisition of subject-matter jurisdiction depends on the facts existing at the time jurisdiction is invoked, and a court ordinarily does not lose jurisdiction by the occurrence of subsequent events, even if those events would have prevented the court from acquiring jurisdiction in the first place. Thomas v. Fed. Deposit Ins. Corp., 255 P.3d 1073, 1081 (Colo. 2011). However, juvenile courts are creatures of statute, and the statutory language establishing the scope of their jurisdiction necessarily delimits that jurisdiction. City & Cnty. of Denver v. Dist. Court, 675 P.2d 312, 314\n\n[¶15] The Code enables the state to \" 'intercede to protect the health, safety, and welfare of minors from abuse, neglect, or abandonment.'\" N.G., ¶ 18 (quoting L.L. v. People, 10 P.3d 1271, 1275 (Colo. 2000)). The definition of \" child\" as a person under the age of eighteen is not only clear and unambiguous, but also accords with the Code's purpose of protecting minors. The under-eighteen age requirement, which applies as a jurisdictional prerequisite to the bringing of a dependency and neglect proceeding, facilitates that purpose. See § 19-3-505(1); N.D.V., 224 P.3d at 415.\n\n[¶16] The Division and GAL are correct that the dependency and neglect petition vested the juvenile court with subject-matter jurisdiction at the time it was filed. However, at that stage of the proceeding, the subject-matter jurisdiction conferred was limited. It authorized the court to issue only temporary orders preceding the adjudication. A.H., 271 P.3d at 1120. As the statutory scheme shows, a court does not gain the jurisdictional foundation for non-emergency state intervention under the statutory scheme until the child is adjudicated dependent and neglected. See id. at 1121. Indeed, if the dependency and neglect allegations are not proven, the court's limited jurisdiction ends and it must dismiss the petition and return the child to the parent. Id. Thus, although a failure to follow statutory requirements or a procedure will not divest a court of subject matter jurisdiction ordinarily, see N.D.V., 224 P.3d at 414, the court's limited jurisdiction in this case necessarily would have ended upon M.C.S.'s adjudication.\n\n[¶17] Construing the relevant statutes together and consistent with their plain meaning, we conclude that a juvenile court has subject-matter jurisdiction only to adjudicate children younger than eighteen. The statutory scheme treats age as a jurisdictional prerequisite both at the filing of a dependency and neglect petition and at the time of adjudication. We are not at liberty to expand either the definition of \" child\" or the court's jurisdictional reach. See M.D.E., ¶ 12 (holding that the unambiguous definition of grandparent does not include a \" great-grandparent,\" and therefore, great-grandparents have no standing to seek visitation rights); see also H., 74 P.3d at 497 (court had no jurisdiction over an unborn child where the dependency and neglect statutes did not specifically include unborn children within their protection and the dependency and neglect proceeding was commenced before the child's birth).\n\n[¶18] We acknowledge that the Code is to be liberally construed to serve the welfare of children and the best interests of society. § 19-1-102(2), C.R.S. 2013. However, that directive does not provide authority to redefine the term \" child\" contrary to its plain meaning. See M.D.E., ¶ 16 (principle of liberal construction may not be invoked to alter the plain meaning of a statute or to extend the application of its provisions beyond the clear limits of their reach).\n\n[¶19] Further, the interpretation we adopt does not render the court's continuing jurisdiction under section 19-3-205(1) superfluous or otherwise frustrate the purpose of providing ongoing protection. Indeed, the language of that section supports our interpretation here to the extent it requires an adjudication before the court's jurisdiction will be extended past the child's eighteenth birthday. As discussed, the Code protects minor children. The continuation of jurisdiction under section 19-3-205(1) simply enables the court to assist a minor child already adjudicated under its supervision in the transition to adulthood.\n\n[¶20] Although we conclude that the statutory scheme requires adjudication before the child reaches eighteen years of age for the court to maintain jurisdiction even though the petition was filed four months before that date, we note that this same scheme appears inconsistent in allowing continuing jurisdiction until a minor child reaches age twenty-one if adjudication occurs before the child is eighteen. See § 19-3-205(1). The requirement of adjudication before eighteen, even though a petition is timely filed, also allows a parent to deliberately delay the adjudication in hopes of obtaining a dismissal.\n\nPage 364\n\nIII. Conclusion\n\n[¶21] The order is affirmed.\n\nCHIEF JUDGE LOEB and JUDGE MÁRQUE", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "10d97d16-2db0-4760-9106-d0232a87b978", "url": "http://co.findacase.com/research/wfrmDocViewer.aspx/xq/fac.20140410_0000658.CO.htm/qx"}

It's the new 2017 BMW Alpina B7 xDrive. It may not have the famous performance M badge, but who cares when it is supercar fast delivering 600-horsepower.\n\nThe 2017 Alpina B7 is BMW's new flagship performance sedan. It's the third generation of the Alpina badged BMW 7 Series offered in the U.S. and make no mistake about it, this is a huge sedan.\n\nIt comes with a new engine — a 4.4-liter twin-turbocharged V8 under the hood good for 600-horses and 590 pound-feet of torque available from 3,000 rpm. It's mated to an eight-speed automatic.\n\nWhat you get in the end is fast. We're talking 0-60 in just 3.6 seconds, that's 0.8 seconds quicker than its predecessor. The top speed is an estimated 193 miles per hour. There is also a Launch Control mode if you're feeling really crazy.\n\nThe suspension and chassis have also been upgraded and its all-wheel-drive system comes recalibrated. You can read about all the technical details here. It's fitted with Michelin Pilot Super Sport tires for handling.\n\nThe interior gets even fancier than the 750 xDrive — which the B7 is based on. It comes with nicer leather and trim, along with a custom digital instrument cluster with a variety of display modes. You even get production plaques on the doors to remind yourself what exactly it is you're riding in.\n\nWe don't have pricing yet, but it will definitely be well above the $97,400 price tag of the 750 xDrive.\n\nThe new BMW Alpina B7 will go on sale at BMW dealerships in September.", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "8bcab06e-b19c-4bd4-8f9d-4bb550239c49", "url": "http://www.carprousa.com/the-new-bmw-2017-alpina-b7-xdrive-is-supercar-fast"}

{"text": "Free Gifts!? What'll You Do With Yours?\n\nThis is not normal. The plants are budding, the grass is greening and birds are singing – all ushering in a new season with pomp and circumstance. And it feels so…weird.\n\nI've lived in Minnesota nearly my whole life; I know the seasons like the back of my hand. Winter is long and hard, but when spring finally arrives in April or May, it feels like the sweetest reward for surviving brutally bitter temperatures and mountains of snow. But this past winter was neither long nor hard – and there's no sign of it returning for one last bitter blast {which it usually does}.\n\nSo, we're all tiptoeing around – as if we might stir winter awake or curse our good fortune – as the earth springs to life around us. Yesterday, my cousin Nate said it's like finding $40 at the ATM, unsuccessfully looking for its rightful owner, and then feeling too guilty to spend it. So true; we feel undeserving of this gift, unsure of how to bloom without suffering through a dark winter first, worried that it's too good to be true.\n\nThis is how most of us approach unexpected blessings; we let guilt overshadow gratitude and let our past dictate the present and future. We spend countless frigid winters begging for mercy – and then feel bad when spring arrives early. We spend years hoping for change in our work, our relationships, our finances – and then question any change that comes too easy.\n\nI know this may sound craaaaazy…but what if we just choose to receive it all with grace and glee, like the trees and flowers that are rising up to meet spring's early arrival? The buds are popping here, joyfully embracing the chance to be in the world earlier than ever before. Wiser than most us, happier than most of us, fulfilling their mission to bloom and grow.

About Alexza Pharmaceuticals Inc. ...\n\nMOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif., Dec. 7, 2010 /PRNewswire/ -- Alexza Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Nasdaq: ALXA) announced today that the Company has scheduled an End-of Review meeting with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in December to discuss the Complete Response Letter (CRL) regarding the Company's New Drug Application (NDA) for AZ-004 (Staccato loxapine). Alexza has submitted an Information Package to the FDA in preparation for the meeting, with the responses or proposals to the issues raised in the CRL. AZ-004 is being developed for the rapid treatment of agitation in schizophrenia or bipolar disorder patients.\n\nThe Company anticipates the FDA meeting will be a comprehensive review of the issues identified by the FDA in the CRL, and Alexza's planned responses to those issues. The Company's primary meeting goal is to clarify and fully understand the key issues, and to establish a plan to respond to those issues. While the CRL follow-up meeting will be held in December, the Company does not expect the official FDA meeting minutes to be available until at least late January 2011. The Company anticipates providing a further U.S. regulatory update on AZ-004 after receipt of the official FDA correspondence.\n\nAlexza also announced today that it has met with the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and has received written confirmation that AZ-004 is eligible for submission of a Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) under the centralized registration procedure. In addition, Alexza has been notified of the Rapporteur and Co-Rapporteur appointments for the AZ-004 review. The Company believes that the comprehensive clinical development program for AZ-004 meets the requirements for the MAA filing. Alexza expects to submit the MAA mid-year 2011 and submitted the AZ-004 NDA in December 2009. In October 2010, the Company received a CRL from the FDA, regarding its NDA for AZ-004. A CRL is issued by FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research indicating that the NDA review cycle is complete and the application is not ready for approval in its present form. The Company is currently evaluating the FDA's comments in the CRL and has scheduled a meeting with the FDA in December 2010 to discuss the CRL.\n\nFor more information about Alexza, the Staccato technology or the Company's development programs, please visit \n\nSafe Harbor Statement\n\nThis press release includes forward-looking statements regarding the development and safety of the Company's product candidates and technologies including the risks under the headings: \"Regulatory authorities may not approve our product candidates even if they meet safety and efficacy endpoints in clinical trials.\", \"We have a history of net losses.

{"text": ": Condos, Cabins & More\n(300+)\n\nRecent Michigan City Reviews\n\nWe stayed in this home while we were picking up a brand new puppy in January 2017. We did not notice any industrial noise. We got in late on our first night, and the neighbor's dogs were really loud as we were unloading our luggage and exploring the yard. However, the next day, any time the neighbor's dogs barked, the neighbors shushed them or brought them back inside. We slept well. We had some snow, but the city had a salt-truck out within an hour of the snow stopping. All of the bedrooms are carpeted, but the other areas of the home are either wood or tile. We were worried our new puppy might make messes, but she did great. She ran straight to the sliding glass door to go in the yard when she had to go potty. There was a scooper and a rake for cleaning up puppy messes, but it was frozen together so we just used waste bags to clean up after our puppy. There was a garbage bin outside, so it made it convenient for disposing of the waste. There was also a bin for recycling, which was good because we went through a lot of soda-- so many flavors that we can't get at home! The Wi-Fi was good. We didn't watch much TV. We ordered pizza from a nearby place called Little Giants at the Beach, and their pizza was pretty good. Orders were delivered quickly, too. The owners made us feel so welcome from the moment I emailed them about our stay. We didn't visit the casino or anything like that, so it was so nice to feel comfortable and welcome in the cottage. There's a washer and dryer in the bathroom, but we didn't need to do laundry. The water pressure is good in the shower, and there were plenty of linens. Check-out was super easy, too. Some places want you to wash and dry your towels before you leave, but this place just asked that we leave them next to the washer and dryer.\n\nCastle in the Sand is the perfect spot for a getaway with friends or family. We spend most of our time together in the large kitchen/dining area and on the screened-in front porch. The property is about 30 minutes from the Warren Dunes, which Were a wonderful place to visit and explore. Being from Chicago, we were happy to find that Uber was also easily accessible. The place was very clean and had all the equipment/amenities you could need. Thank you!\n\nWe stayed at this property for a long weekend. We found it very clean and the furnishings comfortable. Close to stores, less than 10 minutes to the casino, and an easy walk to the beach.\nThe kitchen had everything we needed and was in great shape. The appliances were brand new. The dining room table was very large, it sat 8 people very comfortably.\nThe bedrooms were all correctly described in the listing, the grill worked great, and the back yard is very nice and private with a great fire pit.\nLots of channels on the 3 TVs and the wifi was problem free.\nWe have rented many vacation rentals across the country and this is one would certainly", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "60de4e68-93b7-4e6f-a58d-14ea70e52421", "url": "https://www.vrbo.com/vacation-rentals/usa/indiana/michigan-city"}

{"text": "Search This Blog\n\nThe winners of 2014 Cloud IaaS Gartner Magic Quadrant are best for HPC\n\nHPC stands for High Performance Computing and includes High Performance Throughput computing. The intent to separate the two terms are really politics in academia. If we look at those from entrepreneurial point of view, they are the same\n\nWhat is the connection with Gartner Magic Quadrant? Just read to the end.\n\nGartner Magic Quadrant for Cloud IaaS\n\nThe much expected and world famous Gartner report Magic Quadrant for Cloud Infrastructure as a Service for 2014 is out today.\n\nOver the last few years, Lydia Leong and her team have won a status of a rock star group. She is to cloud computing what Roger Ebert is to movies.\n\nThe report makes an important distinction between Cloud IaaS and Cloud-Enabled System infrastructure (CESI)\n\nWe draw a distinction between cloud infrastructure as a service, and cloud infrastructure as a technology platform; we call the latter cloud-enabled system infrastructure (CESI). In cloud IaaS, the capabilities of a CESI are directly exposed to the customer through self-service. However, other services, including noncloud services, may be delivered on top of a CESI; these cloud-enabled services may include forms of managed hosting, data center outsourcing and other IT outsourcing services. In this Magic Quadrant, we evaluate only cloud IaaS offerings; we do not evaluate cloud-enabled services. (See \"Technology Overview for Cloud-Enabled System Infrastructure,\" \"Technology Overview for Cloud-Enabled Managed Hosting\" and \"Don't Be Fooled by Offerings Falsely Masquerading as Cloud Infrastructure as a Service\" for more on this distinction.)\n\nIn December 2010, Savvis, AT&T, Rackspace, Verizon and Terremark were in the winning quadrant 2. Verizon bought Terremark later, but the combined company dropped down. Amazon was not present at all in the winning quadrant.\n\nBut from 2012 onward, Amazon AWS shot up and they blew the dust away from all competitors.\n\nIt is sad to see Joyent, one of the best promises we had - completely loose its status as the darling company of Cloud IaaS, after both founders left, particularly the charismatic Jason Hoffman\n\nThe biggest surprise is Microsoft. Now Seattle is the world capital of Cloud IaaS, as Amazon is also there.\n\nFig. 1 Gartner Magic Quadrant Cloud December 2010\nNote AWS in the middle of the pack, with a below overlarge ability to execute.\n\nFig. 3 Gartner Magic Quadrant Cloud August 2013.\nAWS further distances from the pack who seemingly move backwards.\nPerhaps all others were unable to update their visions?\n\nWhat does it mean for High Performance Computing?\n\nIt means commercial Cloud IaaS offering can no longer be ignored as way to run most complex HPC applications on demand.\n\nThere is no coincidence that the winners in the 2014 Gartner Cloud IaaS magic quadrant are also the best infrastructures ready for HPC applications. Cycle Computing extraordinary and meteoric success is based on building HTC and HPC applications on demand on IaaS provided by Amazon Web Service.\n\nIt's time for the HPC community to start regarding system administration as a critical aspect of an HPC cluster. We can build better administrative frameworks by drawing on the strategies and tools developed for enterprise IT. Working together as a community, we can dramatically reduce the amount of time that is wasted on outdated, inefficient cluster management practices.\n\nBut the most recent and one of the most efficient enterprise tools is application on demand via a clouds.\n\nFrom Kiev, Ukraine, Vladislav Falfushinsky send me a paper Cloud Computing Platform within Grid Infrastructure authored by him and two colleagues from V.M. Glushkov Institute of Cybernetics\n\nMy advise to Vladislav is to escape the political turmoil and non-sense in Ukraine come here in Silicon Valley and see how their paper can evolve into a tangible business model.\n\nMy HPC /HTC friends can tell me hundreds of reasons why high performance startups will fail. I listen to them all. What makes me happy is to see researchers from Kiev anxious to do something.\n\nThen I ask myself: \"Why not in Wisconsin, Nebraska, Indiana, Mississippi, and so on where there are fantastic centers of expertise in HTC/HPC and they are not located in Burkina Faso?\"", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "fe254802-57fa-4edc-8ad5-afd9c9bbe723", "url": "http://my-inner-voice.blogspot.com/2014/05/the-winners-of-2014-cloud-iaas-gartner.html"}
{"text": "Cricket: Bangladesh reach 246/8 against South Africa\n\nMirpur (Bangladesh), July 30 (IANS) After a good start by Bangladesh on the first day of their second and last cricket Test here on Thursday, South Africa came back strongly claiming five wickets in the final session for the hosts to end the day at 246/8.\n\nAt tea, Bangladesh were 154/3 with Mahmudullah and Mushfiqur Rahim at 25 not out and 42 not out, respectively, at the Sher-e-Bangla National Cricket Stadium. But the hosts then lost five quick wickets after ace pacer Dale Steyn removed Mahmudullah to break their 94-run fourth-wicket stand, reports bdnews24.com.\n\nEarlier, Mominul Haque and Imrul Kayes set Bangladesh off to a good start despite Tamim Iqbal's early departure. Right-armer Steyn signed up in the 400-club in Tests with Iqbal's wicket in the third over of the day.\n\nIqbal had survived Steyn in his previous over, when Dean Elgar grassed a straight-forward catch at second slip.\n\nSteyn, however, took the opener out as he threw his bat at another to edge one to Hashim Amla in the first slip.\n\nWith the dismissal, the 32-year-old seamer became the second South African to reach the milestone after Shaun Pollock and also the joint second-fastest to do it, alongside Richard Hadlee, in terms of matches behind Muttiah Muralitharan.\n\nSouth African fast bowlers did not give the batsmen room to be comfortable. They kept it tight and attacked with short balls.\n\nPacer Morne Morkel struck Mominul on the side of the helmet in his second over. But Kayes and Mominul dealt with the bowlers without much trouble and steadied the ship.\n\nBoth of them dug deep in their crease to bat patiently and release pressure with occasional boundaries off both the pacers and the spinners.\n\nThe duo shepherded Bangladesh over fifty in the 18th over. However, off-spinner Jean-Paul Duminy struck twice in successive overs to remove Mominul (40) and Kayes (30) shortly after lunch break.\n\nMominul edged him back to Dane Vilas for the debutant wicketkeeper's first international dismissal and then Duminy trapped Kayes leg-before in his next over.\n\nAfter the 69-run stand was broken, Mahmudullah and skipper Mushfiqur Rahim took control and regained momentum with another steady partnership of 94 runs.\n\nRahim (65) went back edging spinner Dean Elgar back to the wicketkeeper Dane Vilas.\n\nThe skipper scored his 15th Test half-century off 79 deliveries with seven boundaries.\n\nSteyn took his second scalp of the day when Mahmudullah (35) flicked a full delivery straight to Temba Bavuma at short midwicket.\n\nThe hosts were 220 for 6 in 78 overs with Shakib Al Hasan and Nasir Hossain looking for a partnership but then Shakib fell after scoring 33 runs. Hossain, however is still unbeaten on 13.\n\nMohammad Shahid (1) was the last Bangladesh batsman to walk back as Steyn disturbed his citadel.", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "f56b6d59-e5c7-48eb-bc3a-d727429cf3c0", "url": "http://www.mangalorean.com/cricket-bangladesh-reach-2468-against-south-africa/"}

{"text": "Gingerbread Decorating Party {Featured Party}\n\nChristmas in July is upon us! I love the Christmas holiday and there are so many reasons to throw a party! Our favorite tradition is our annual Gingerbread House Decorating party. It is one party that all of our friends look forward to and it tops my son's list of holiday events every year! So when I stumbled upon this Gingerbread Decorating party from Debbie of Wants & Wishes, I had to share it. I have already purchased her printables for our gathering this year. Cannot wait! Take a look, get inspired and get in the holiday spirit this Christmas in July!\n\nDebbie shares the party details:\n\n\"Decorating gingerbread houses is in my top 3 of things I LOVE to do during the Christmas season (my top 2 are decorating the Christmas tree/ house and making sweets!) So it was only natural that I have a gingerbread decorating party! I made homemade gingerbread parts for the houses the night before. Each guest/ child got a platter (shown above) with the walls, roof and sides to their own gingerbread house. I filled a ramekin with cinnamon squares for their chimney if they choose to use them that way.At each place setting there was a platter from Crate and Barrel with the gingerbread house parts. Off to the side was the round white plastic base for them to build their house on. We used our gingerbread house milk carton with a straw and one of our flag (from our gingerbread collection) for the \"name card\" and a gingerbread house sugar cookie from Dough Punchers boxed with a thank you for coming tag.\n\nWe also had a dessert table with more goodies on it with our printables. The printables collection includes: drink wrappers, cupcake toppers, pattern papers, flags, gingerbread house template, banner, cupcake wrappers and much more! Here is the back and side of the gingerbread house milk carton, embellished with icing details and decorations. Our candy parfaits. Layered with red hots, strawberry puffs, peppermint candies and topped with \"peppermint\" sugar cookie (also by Dough Punchers) in a plastic shot glass. Then we attached one of our 2″ toppers to a sucker stick for a little party pick! Add some color to your cookies by filling the tray with candies…. we used the classic red hots candies for that pop of color!\"\n\nI personally can't wait for our annual Gingerbread Decorating party this year!

{"text": "Sports look enhances new Peugeot 'GT Line' models\n\nPosted on: 28th Apr 2015\n\nA new sportier PEUGEOT range is launched under the identity of 'GT Line', which presents a visually enhanced, sportier aspect to the 308, 508, RCZ and new 208 ranges, expanding customer choice and positioned high-up in the range. With dynamic style, the new GT Line models provide customers with a valued combination similar in the style and equipment of the GT versions and with more affordable engines.\n\nIn most cases the GT Line models can be identified by their larger wheels, twin exhaust tailpipes, RedLine colour scheme for the touch screen, Full-LED headlamps (308 & 508), LED directional indicators (308, 508) and LED rear lights (208, 308, 508). A sporty and top-of-the-range ambience comes through with the association of black and red trim and 'GT Line' badging applied to the bodywork.\n\nNew PEUGEOT 208 GT Line: a striking new trim level of choice\n\nThe revised PEUGEOT 208 continues its move up-market with the arrival of a new trim level specification – GT Line - and adopts many of the styling attributes of the iconic GTi model.\n\nAvailable in three and five-door versions, 208 GT Line is available with a choice of three engines – the 1.2-litre PureTech 110hp S&S petrol in manual or EAT6 (auto) transmissions or the 1.6-litre BlueHDi diesel in either 100hp or 120hp outputs. The GT Line finish is derived from the Allure trim and features an 'Equalizer grille' with red 3D markings, a gloss black grille and front fog lamp finishers, with 17-inch Caesium alloy wheels, gloss black door mirror shells, chrome window surrounds and a chrome exhaust finisher. It has GT Line badges on the grille, front wings and tailgate, plus red PEUGEOT lettering front and rear.\n\nThe PEUGEOT 308 GT Line adopts the aesthetics of the new PEUGEOT 308 GT on both Hatchback and SW versions. The Lion is also present within the grille, highlighted by three horizontal chrome bars. Lighting comes in the form of top of the range Full-LED headlamps and rear LED lights. The PEUGEOT 308 GT Line has a total of 142 LEDs.\n\nEquipped as standard in the UK, the PEUGEOT 308 GT Line has 18'' Diamant alloy wheels, sill finishers which visually lower the car's stance and black lacquered diffuser and finishers, such as the twin exhaust tailpipes, all of which also feature on the 308 GT. The GT Line signature is applied to the grille, bonnet and front wings.\n\nIn the cabin, red stitching is used on the TEP/Alcantara trimmed seats, specific full-grained leather steering wheel, door panels, dashboard and gear lever gaiter. The 9.7\" touch screen follows this theme with the RedLine colour scheme. The sporty and top of the range ambience is finished off by the anthracite headlining and pillar trims, stainless steel door sill finishers and aluminium on the foot rest and pedals. The Driver Sport Pack is available as an option on eligible engine types.\n\nThe PEUGEOT 508 GT Line and 508 SW GT Line benefit from the major changes made to the new PEUGEOT 508 presented at the Paris Motor Show. They present an assertive exterior style with, notably, a vertical chromed grille which includes the new brand identity of the Lion in its centre, Full-LED headlamps and LED foglamps. The exterior styling also includes specific 18'' GT Line alloy wheels and twin exhaust tailpipe finishers on the rear skirt. In addition, the PEUGEOT 508 SW GT Line has dark tinted side windows and a panoramic sunroof. The GT Line signature is applied to the grille and the front wings.\n\nThe cabin is marked by red stitching on the Marston Tramontane half-leather seats, the mats and the gear lever gaiter. The 7'' touch screen, built into the middle of the dashboard, adopts the RedLine colour scheme and displays the image returned by the reversing camera. The technological content also includes blind spot sensors, keyless entry and starting and colour head-up display.\n\nGT Line is available on the PEUGEOT 508 with either the 1.6 litre BlueHDi 120 with a 6-speed manual or EAT6 transmission, or 2.0 litre BlueHDi 150 with a 6-speed manual transmission.\n\nRCZ GT Line\n\nThe RCZ highlights curvaceous style as the Brands Sports Coupé and the GT Line features an enhance specification; its 19'' Technical Grey alloy wheels, Xenon headlamps with titanium masks, gloss black door mirrors, the red line in its wheel caps, twin exhaust tail pipes and the GT Line badge in the grille serve to highlight its blend of style and specification.\n\nIn the cabin, red stitching is used on the small sport steering wheel, mats, gear lever gaiter, Alcantara leather seats, dashboard, door panels and leather door inserts. The seat belts carry a red line feature, with other interior features including: Satellite Navigation, Climate Control and DAB radio.\n\nPEUGEOT RCZ GT Line is available with the 1.6 litre THP 200 6-speed manual.\n\nWith this new GT Line, customers can enjoy the style, equipment, resolutely sporting ambiance and wide range of engines this line has to offer, whether on the latest PEUGEOT 208, 308, 508 or RCZ", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "bd78f580-d0f9-4fcd-bb73-8d0031685722", "url": "http://www.wjking.co.uk/news/sports-look-enhances-new-peugeot-gt-line-models"}

The case revolves around an FCC order banning Comcast's blocking its broadband customers from the file-sharing technology BitTorrent. The original order by the FCC was issued when the commission was headed by Republican Kevin Martin. The current commission, chaired by Democrat Julius Genachowski, is placing a top priority on the issue of net neutrality.\n\n• The expected closings at Reed Business Information began a little earlier than expected with the news that Video Business was being shuttered, along with MBT (Manufacturing Business Technology) and Industrial Distribution. Penton quickly followed with the news that two of its B2B pubs would stop publishing print editions and become online only pubs.\n\n• The Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas was held and the news was tablets, tablets, tablets (oh, and readers, too). Whether you are in the newspaper, magazine or book business, new devices are being targeted at consumers.\n\nComputerWorld states the obvious: You don't need to work in my business to know that publishing is in a world of hurt. Newspapers and magazines are cutting staff or closing down due to declining readerships and the loss of advertisers. Book publishers, also losing readers, bank on high-priced blockbusters, franchise publications, and dashed-off tell-all books, and take fewer risks with unknown authors.\n\nThis same article also pointed to an older post on MacWorld that asks \"Does Apple really want to sell magazines?\": Apple would need to create a new set of iTunes storefronts for books, magazines, and newspapers, and would need to sign deals with major publishers. Publishers would need to present their content to Apple in a compatible format, which could be easy or hard, depending on if Apple were to support a common format or create something completely new.\n\n• Yet more CES news: Sling Media, maker of the Sling Box (I want one, too bad Christmas is over), announced support for Flash support in its hardware and software products. The Sling Box allows users to view television broadcasts on their computer when the device is hooked up to a cable box. Sling Media also has an iPhone app that allows users to watch live television on their phones via their Sling Box.\n\n• And finally, this story backs up my assertion that Microsoft head honcho Steve Ballmer's CES keynote address was a bit of a disappointment.\n\nApple must be patting themselves on the back, as the Hewlett-Packard (HP) tablet unveiled by Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer on Wednesday night failed to wow those expecting a true competitor to the mythical Apple tablet ...

{"text": "Exhibition Manager Information & Diary\n\nImportant Information\nThis layout is unusual in that the height of the trackbed from the floor is approximately 5ft. Exhibition managers must consider if this is likely to provide viewing issues for exhibition visitors. If so, you should not request this layout for your exhibition. The layout is also operated from the front as three link couplings are in use. There will need to be comfortable walking space in front for at least one operator, along the full length of the layout. Access will be required to the rear of the layout for set up/break down/maintenance, so at least one metre access space as a minimum will be required behind the layout.\n\nScale and Gauge\n4mm Scale, OO gauge using Peco Code 75 track. The normal operation is with DC, however it also has the functionality to convert easily to DCC.\n\nEra\n1950's through to mid 1960's. The layout is operated with stock to suit time period, and is based in the Forest of Dean, Gloucestershire.\n\nBase board foot print max 12ft x 3ft ( Please add 1 metre for operator corridor on frontage, and one metre behind for maintenance, and sufficient access space to walk around end to rear of layout)\nHeight to top of backscene 6ft 6in.\nSet up break down time, approx 30-45 minutes\n\nOperators/ Three (minimum)\n\nLayout Transport / 1 x Estate car Ford Mondeo size (minimum)\n\nAvailability / The layout is not on the exhibition circuit due to the owners work committments and will only do two or three shows each year at a maximum.

A floor to accommodate displaying the layout on. Carpet depth must be 5mm top layer, with a 7mm underlay underneath.

It seems that we haven't had time to take a breath since we started the application process to Lifeline Children's Services in May. Wow! The amazing thing is……we are just weeks away from traveling to Hungary to meet our children and bring them home!!!\n\nWe sat by our beautiful tree last night, drinking hot chocolate and eating chocolate chip cookies (My Tony makes awesome Cocoa and Cookies!) and we talked and dreamed about next month. If everything goes according to plan we will be meeting our kids in less than 5 weeks! This has been an amazing journey! God has blessed us all along the way. Every time we have a payment due or a fee to pay, God has brought precious people along who have blessed us financially. Every time we have had a need, God has been right there to provide, just in time!\n\nWe were talking last night, about how Jesus was adopted by Joseph. Joseph raised Jesus as his own son. And if Jesus had not come to earth as a baby, we would not have been adopted as God's very own children – His sons and daughters. We are so blessed to be a part of the miracle of adoption as God's kids and so blessed that He chose us to adopt these precious children from Hungary. We look forward to sharing this story and God's abundant love with our son and daughter.\n\nIn a few weeks, the miracle of a family will take place. God has already placed such love for these children in our hearts. We have made all of the preparations that we can and have worked so hard to make a special place for them. It has been a joy to do so. As we think of that, we pause and think of what joy it gave Father God to send His son to earth for us. We think of the joy that He takes in preparing things for us. And we think of how often we forget to be grateful for all that He has done. As we prepare to be parents and experience such joy and overwhelming emotions, we know that it doesn't even begin to compare to how much God loves us, His children. Wow! Father God, watches us daily, waiting for us to look in His direction and spend a few moments with Him.\n\nSo, as Christmas approaches, don't forget to pause before your Father in Heaven Who loved you so much, He gave you all He has! God bless each of you as you celebrate the wonderful miraculous gift of Jesus!!!!!", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "8c5707c2-6b0c-4e27-a40d-2d039c65ceb4", "url": "https://therosettasadoption.wordpress.com/tag/christmas-tree/"}

{"text": "Stephanie Roberts is a victim of abuse, but making the decision to leave her abuser--her husband Mark--isn't easy. Time and again she forgives his emotional and physical cruelty; she loves him and wants the marriage to work. However, when Mark lashes out at their teenage son, hitting him repeatedly, Stephanie decides she must act to save her children.\n\nI'll Know You by Heart, the debut novel of author Kimberly Job, struck a nerve with me because I once found myself in the same situation. My husband of five years was domineering and manipulative. He frequently beat me and I feared for my life. I didn't leave him because I didn't think I deserved anything better. It was only when I began to fear for the life of our daughter that I found the courage to depart. That was only the beginning of a turbulent ordeal. My ex-husband was good at showing remorse, he wanted me back under his control. But his good intentions were repeatedly washed away on tides of anger. In some ways similar to that of Stephanie Roberts, my passage to healing was long and painful.\n\nI've read that this novel is based on Kim's own experience—my heart goes out to her. Enduring spousal abuse, being trodden into submission by the man who is supposed to love you, is heart wrenching and demeaning; one of the deepest betrayals of trust. To relive abuse through committing it to paper is something I haven't yet attempted. I admire Kim for her willingness to journey through turmoil and pain as she constructs the lives of Stephanie Roberts and Jared Wakefield, the man Stephanie falls in love with. Jared has endured his share of heartache as well. After losing his wife in a car accident he struggles to find himself again and to define his role as father to his young daughter.\n\nKim deftly shows the inner struggles both Stephanie and Jared experience as they strive to maintain emotional equilibrium. And she has penned a cast of well-crafted family members, from children to in-laws, whose lives are also impacted by the inherent anguish and scars of violence, divorce, and loss. The story is testament of the power of love and the strength of the human spirit.\n\nI appreciate the invitation of Kimberly Job's publisher to read and review I'll Know You by Heart. I look forward to reading more of Kim's work.\n\nFrom the back cover:\n\nThe day Stephanie Roberts met Jared Wakefield, she didn't realize they'd met before. Running from an abusive marriage and trying to safeguard her children, she turns to Jared for support, but he needs more from her than she might be capable of giving. With her abusive husband looming in her past, the difficulties they must overcome to be together seem insurmountable.\n\nIs it possible for love to conquer all? I'll Know You By Heart is a timeless romance that explores the possibility that relationships span the entire realm of eternity. A story about abuse, hardship, and betrayal, it is ultimately a story about the healing power of everlasting true love.\n\nI cannot wait to read this book. I've been saving my pennies to get it for myself--not just because I think it sounds good but because I know Kim to be a wonderful, insightful woman. I can't wait to read it", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "5ef5aef3-9ffc-4a0b-b1d4-9ed5dab8e5ee", "url": "http://forethoughtandpurpose.blogspot.com/2010/04/read.html"}

You will have amazing results for your traffic as long as you use them effectively on social media sites such as facebook and Twitter.\n\nYou will be aided in business promotions if you showcase honey in a unique manner. A car that has the URL of the site on the side of it would be good if you have car related honey. The honey should be displayed on the car as well. You do not want to harm the reputation that you are trying to build by outrageous promotions. Take care when deciding.\n\nBest way to sell online is to feature the most popular honey for the season. At the holiday times just advertise $FREE shipping to the gift recipients' home. You can even include a gift card for FREE!\n\nUse special offers and promotions to help boost your sales. For example, offer a 3 for the price of 2 special. Similarly, you should design your website to maximize your potential.

Concentrate on the customers so that you'll always continue growing, whether you are on the radar or not.\n\nIt is up to you how large you want your market base to become. Decide exactly how large you want your market base to be. It is important for you to research your target areas and make sure that you do not of outgrow your ability to deliver honey to your customers. When marketing your site can your honey it is important that you try and reach a broad demographic.\n\nDo not just enlist your business with one search engines.

If insurance costs go up it's simply added to the company's overhead. That's what this weird looking, shitty pizza selling dude is saying. The company never pays these increases, the costs have to be passed on to consumers and/or made up for by reducing staff while performing at the same level.

The problem is – he'll add 14 cents and take the millions as bonus money. I'm no commie asshole but think corporations have 0 loyalty to workers. I understand we get paid but we also deliver your results. The problem here is that the prick can't outsource the jobs to India. Corporations are not in the business of creating jobs just to create jobs. Therefore, tax breaks won't magically create jobs unless the company actually needs the employee. If his cuts make people wait longer for pies and cost them customers they will keep them on as workers. I don't buy the layoff shit here. We need to make the cost of doing business here that includes healthcare.\n\nzel\n\nNovember 11, 2012 at 9:17 pm\n\n@rockdory @TBoAtl Are you sure they can't outsource?

The would rather add it and take the profits. I know this is a ridiculous perspective but I'm sure corporations were just as bent when they could no longer use slaves. Guess what -cost of doing business is not providing healthcare for workers.\n\nrockdory\n\nNovember 11, 2012 at 9:05 pm\n\nMeant the cost of doing business is now providing healthcare.\n\nDerekWeber\n\nNovember 11, 2012 at 9:10 pm\n\n@rockdory I don't dispute that, spread out across every pizza sold, it's a minimal increase. The tone of the post was that this guy is an asshole because he doesn't want out to cut into profits and that's not really fair.\n\nrockdory\n\nNovember 11, 2012 at 9:15 pm\n\n@DerekWeber agree. If the cost of 14 cents a pie is a benchmark it doesn't seem like too much. I'd pay extra here and there for goods and services for healthcare. I'd also be far more likely to support a corporation who lets it known that this is the case. If a company came out and said \"we are sacrificing profits and slightly increasing cost to provide insurance for our employees\" maybe they would gain a shitload of business. In order for this to work, the employees would need to be great and helpful to the customers.\n\nindpendnt\n\nNovember 11, 2012 at 9:38 pm\n\n@rockdory @DerekWeber if thats the case then buy your own insurance and pay that tax penalty too, you know the one they said wasn't a tax?\n\nindpendnt\n\nNovember 11, 2012 at 9:35 pm\n\n@rockdory @DerekWeber you realize that these costs are considered OVERHEAD COSTS(and not just this pizza company but all companies) , and the CONSUMER(me and you) pay this cost in the final price of the product. So if you're TOO STUPID to know BARRY is FUCKING YOU with more taxes. GOOD FOR YOU IN YOUR WORLD OF IGNORANCE!\n\nrockdory\n\nNovember 11, 2012 at 9:40 pm\n\n@indpendnt @DerekWeber dude, the company I work for makes 4 billion a year in profit and they're constantly laying off or outsourcing to cheaper labor. It's the nature of a corporation. If Mitt won and they kept the same tax cuts would that change? No. Don't tell me how I'm getting fucked. Pass the costs onto us, I could give a fuck. We need to make giving healthcare to our workers a cost of doing business. Slave owners probably said the same shit and guess what?

I bet a pedophile feels you (I assume) are bigoted!\n\nzel\n\nNovember 11, 2012 at 9:13 pm\n\nI think his problem is that he let crazy Peyton Manning give away 2,000,000 free pizzas. Even after telling Peyton he only wanted to give away 1,000,000 free pizzas, Peyton told him to STFU and go play in a corner.\n\nSuch a pushover.\n\nBTW, their pizza sucks anyway. Fuck him.\n\nindpendnt\n\nNovember 11, 2012 at 9:20 pm\n\nNothing like punishing the success of someone to pay for those who rather sit on their asses. Let's try and create jobs. Here's an ideaThey're not innocent. These rich motherfuckers have most of their money in tax shelters and are paying shit.\n\nindpendnt\n\nNovember 11, 2012 at 9:28 pm\n\n@zel how much state and local taxes did he pay? not to mention sales tax? Besides, if you don't like the TAX LAWS get together and demand a FLAT TAX. Otherwise, you are just being dumb\n\nzel\n\nNovember 11, 2012 at 10:08 pm\n\n@indpendnt\nA flat tax is not the only possible answer. And sales tax is an equal tax to all (within his state), so how much he paid is irrelevant.\n\nindpendnt\n\nNovember 11, 2012 at 10:20 pm\n\n@zel so do you have a tax shelter like a flexable spending account or a 401K or another type of retirement account? You realize that the money he paid in taxes are on dividends and profits off property? Not from working a job? That is from money that he paid taxes on before he invested it and now they tax the extra made? I don't think you understand this class warfare bullshit you're spewing. Guess you never pan on being successful. You realize that when he dies, he has a death tax of 50% of everything he owns will be paid to the Government?\n\nzel\n\nNovember 11, 2012 at 10:30 pm\n\n@indpendnt\nAll the more worse! I actuallyt have to go to a job and work and I pay 30% He makes million upon millions of dollars from \"moving money\" and pays 14%.\n\nI don't plan on being successful? I am very successful. and I pay 30%.\n\nAnd don't you worry your pretty little heart. I'm sure he has all of those tax shelters worked out just nicely so that all of his little kiddies get the money without taxes being applied for. Then his republicans can cry and ask for a \"tax repatriation\" exemption.\n\nindpendnt\n\nNovember 11, 2012 at 10:36 pm\n\n@zel why aren't you cry babying about the 47% who pay NOTHING AND ACTUALLY GET EXTRA MONEY just for filing. Also, compare the minuscule amount that you pay, compared to his millions?\nrockdory\n\nNovember 11, 2012 at 11:07 pm\n\n@indpendnt @zel read up on the 47%. Around 12% actually pay nothing. Most are people who work and pay state payroll tax plus other taxes. The 47% also includes senior citizens who worked their whole life and paid into social security. They did pay taxes during their whole, working life. Veterans and students also exist in this group. It's not just bums freeloading, dude. Read up on it.\n\nzel\n\nNovember 11, 2012 at 11:10 pm\n\n@indpendnt First off, fuck you. I'm allowed to state what the fuck I think and it's not \"crybabying\". If it is, well then you're \"crybabying too. So fuck off.\n\nSecondly, I don't care that he paid \"millions\" in taxes. He has that and more to spare. If he's a \"jobs creator\" (and he isn't), he's using the services and infrastructurethat the government has provided through the use of his taxes.\n\nYeah, this goes back to that whole \"you didn't build that!\" spat.\n\nI can already imagine your head exploding, and I love it. Roads, schools, scientific research, law enforcement, firefighting,defense. All of these are provided by the government.\n\nCan these be provided by private companies and corporations? Sure, but only if there's a profit to be made. I don't want law enforcement, firefighting, and defense to be provided by the private market on a \"for-profit\" basis at all.\n\nRoads, research, schools. Sure, there is room for some private investment, and there is plenty of that to be seen, but there should also be a basic level of access to these things that the average person can benefit from. Because we should NOT be a nation that leaves the weakest behind.\n\nSo you ask me what I think about the \"47% who pay NOTHING AND ACTUALLY GET EXTRA MONEY just for filing.\"\n\nFirst off, irony. Look it up. A few posts ago you told me that \"MITT ROMNEY PAYS STATE TAXES AND SALES TAXES TOO. OMG#@!#!@#!\" Guess what? So do the 47%. They pay state taxes, sales tax, federal payroll taxes.\n\nHow about welfare? I agree with you, to a point. There are dirtbags out there who leech off the system and are no fucking good. My sister is one of them. She has 4 kids and is on welfare. She doesn't have a job. What's her next move? She has another fucking baby. She's trash. I've told her that myself.\n\nBut I have also known plenty of military members who have been on WIC and have qualified for food stamps. Are they fucking moochers, you piece of shit? I don't think they are. When I was in the military, I was almost always a member of the \"47%\" in that I often received a refund. Was I a fucking moocher, you piece of shit?\n\nExcuse me if I ask Mr. Mitt Romney to spare a few extra hundred thousand dollars off of his multimillions he made through capital gains so that others, many of whom just need a temporary helping hand, can get through the day without worrying about what their kids will eat for the day.\n\n*rant over/won't be responding any more*\n\nindpendnt\n\nNovember 11, 2012 at 11:18 pm\n\n@zel WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA! They paid taxes on dividends! Yes it is a lesser amount. But if crybabies like you would fight for FLAT TAXES with NO DEDUCTIONS, then he would've paid the SAME PERCENTAGE as you! WAAAAAAAAA! But remember that the 47% or so that got checks for existing would've not got that check, but would've ACTUALLY CONTRIBUTED instead of being a BLACKHOLE for money! EVERYONE WINS!\n\nCan you say COMMON SENSE, instead of WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!\n\nindpendnt\n\nNovember 11, 2012 at 11:19 pm\n\n@zel BTW, should I cuss at you now? WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!\n\nindpendnt\n\nNovember 11, 2012 at 11:26 pm\n\n@zel also, you realize those amounts don't include Social Security and Medicare Tax. But you don't understand that the money you pay to SS and Medicare is what they pay per employee. So consider that as well!\n\nindpendnt\n\nNovember 11, 2012 at 11:28 pm\n\n@zel forgot to tell you, I laughed and no my head didn't explode. I aslo forgot to say WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!\n\nrockdory\n\nNovember 11, 2012 at 9:33 pm\n\n@indpendnt These people are employees which ,means they are working. They are not sitting on their asses. Please know the difference and stop putting them in the same group.\n\nindpendnt\n\nNovember 11, 2012 at 10:44 pm\n\n@rockdory what people?\n\nrockdory\n\nNovember 11, 2012 at 9:35 pm\n\n@indpendnt Corporations do not create or keep jobs just because they have money around. I work for a company that's makes 4 billion/year profit and they are always downsizing. If Romney won and they kept the Bush tax cuts would that change? Fuck no.\n\nindpendnt\n\nNovember 11, 2012 at 9:42 pm\n\n@rockdory @indpendnt well if they don't have the money, they aren't as likely to invest in new products and services which DO CREATE JOBS. They also are more likely not to have small businesses start like myself who was going to invest in a company venture if Barry didn't get elected. So use your class warfare BULLSHIT to justify your IGNORANCE!\n\nrockdory\n\nNovember 11, 2012 at 9:46 pm\n\n@indpendnt The election is over. Hopefully we got the right guy and it all works out. That's all I can hope for.\n\nindpendnt\n\nNovember 11, 2012 at 9:51 pm\n\n@rockdory well if you like failure, you got the right guy for the job.\n\nrockdory\n\nNovember 11, 2012 at 9:53 pm\n\n@indpendnt In every election I voted in they said the guy who won would ruin the country. The only one they were right about was Bush. Worst economic crisis since the Great Depression. Don't you remember him using those words? Now I'm supposed to roll back to his game plan? No thanks! I don't have GOP amnesia. Btw – I'm a member of the GOP.\n\nindpendnt\n\nNovember 11, 2012 at 10:03 pm\n\n@rockdory you realize it wasn't as bad before we spent almost a trillion dollars on so called infrastructure that actually came to 3% of a trillion dollars? Not to mention more people on disability and welfare? Seems like the last 4 years have been the worst. That trillion had NOTHING to do with a devastating collapse? Weaker dollar do to printing our money like MONOPOLY cash. Rising fuel prices, because they voided all oil exploration on public land leases. Bailing out GM and Chrysler, then they STILL WENT BANKRUPT. Plus giving Chrysler to FIAT for ZERO DOLLARS. Really, Bush was bad for making deals with the LIBERALS who made loans to everyone for homes whether they could pay their payments or not, causing a MORTGAGE COLLAPSE? Those things?\n\nrockdory\n\nNovember 11, 2012 at 10:06 pm\n\n@indpendnt but they do have money. They profit 4 billion a year.\n\nrockdory\n\nNovember 11, 2012 at 10:08 pm\n\n@indpendnt Higher % on welfare because the economy shit the bed. I had 4 neighbors on welfare for the first time in their lives. All are working now – things are picking up. Chill with the fear, race warfare shit. Hard working people sometimes need help.\n\nrockdory\n\nNovember 11, 2012 at 10:10 pm\n\n@indpendnt banks made those loans. After the collapse, a bank offered my buddy who doesn't make a load of cash 500k for a home loan. It's banks.\n\nindpendnt\n\nNovember 11, 2012 at 10:26 pm\n\n@rockdory the banks in MOST CASES were forced to make loans to the SAVAGES that couldn't afford them. I know there was predatory lending, but the rules the LIBERALS set into place cause the ability for a spend your fucking ass off on 4 wheelers and toys and the like. Caused a COLLAPSE which in turn cause this depression that you blame Bush for.\n\nindpendnt\n\nNovember 11, 2012 at 10:31 pm\n\n@rockdory I understand they have a profit, that is how they get money to pay employees bonus(sometimes) and to invest in new products and services to employ more people! If they can it makes this plan below work!\n\nPlease readK Dubya\n\nNovember 11, 2012 at 10:55 pm\n\n@indpendnt Why are you trying to hard to defend those that could give a shit about you?\n\nRFGvac\n\nNovember 11, 2012 at 9:21 pm\n\nThis is precisely the problem with America. Instead of taking pride in employing and bettering the lives of the thousands he employs, men like Schnatter think they should live in opulence and force those who helped him get where he is to live in poverty.\n\nIt's a perverted version of the American Dream.\n\nindpendnt\n\nNovember 11, 2012 at 9:24 pm\n\n@RFGvac wasn't it his risk, hard work and business savvy that made that company successful? I AGREE, LETS PUNISH HIM FOR SUCCESS!\n\nrockdory\n\nNovember 11, 2012 at 9:50 pm\n\n@indpendnt @RFGvac Do you think that's what the argument of slave owners sounded like? \"Oh fu k, this guy invested in all of these slaves and he's a successful business man…. Now we're going to punish him for owning the whole east coast?\n\nindpendnt\n\nNovember 11, 2012 at 9:54 pm\n\n@rockdory @RFGvac why does it always turn to SLAVES and me supposedly be racist if I don't agree with BARRY and the LIBERAL AGENDA? Do you suppose cavemen gave a fuck obout what the fish in the Ocean was doing? This has NOTHING TO DO WITH SLAVES! If someone hates being productive BARRY will help them out.\n\nrockdory\n\nNovember 11, 2012 at 9:57 pm\n\n@indpendnt @RFGvac I don't think you're racist at all. I'm comparing it to a situation where the government said \"you have to do this\" to corporations. Only the change was way more drastic. They lost 100% free labor and still got filthy rich. I'm happy for successful folks and am doing ok myself. I just think we should build our country and communities by giving people healthcare.\n\nindpendnt\n\nNovember 11, 2012 at 10:12 pm\n\n@rockdory it wasn't free labor, they paid for them, they housed, fed them and clothed them. It was fucking bullshit that they could own someone. But it wasn't free labor. But this so called free healthcare you think they are getting isn't free. It cost consumers, and taxpayers. Your children and my children and our grandchildren are going to pay for these SELFISH entitled feeling assholes. Not to mention the TAX PENALTY that they said wasn't a tax.\n\nrockdory\n\nNovember 11, 2012 at 10:19 pm\n\n@indpendnt Or maybe somebody in a family gets sick they get treatment instead of going bankrupt without coverage. Keep in mind this may be working people without insurance. I just want what's best for most people and I would pay a bit more to make it happen.\n\nFanBoy1\n\nNovember 12, 2012 at 2:21 pm\n\n@indpendnt @rockdory My wifes rates have increased 3 times in the past 2 years due in large part to Obamacare (the rate increase statement said just that). and only 1 time Obama actually did something about it(because enough people bitched to the media)….telling bad ole Blue cross they couldnt or shouldnt raise rates in such a large percentage of an increase…… so they backed off, a little……. then raised it 2 more times for a larger percentage then the initial increase…… I know its confusing but thats exactly what happened in my exact case of The government yet telling another \"Business\" how to run themselves. I got screwed 3 X's as hard. and Obamacare has already cost me money and I dont even use it.\n\nFORWARD 2012? no thank you.\n\nRFGvac\n\nNovember 11, 2012 at 11:39 pm\n\n@indpendnt Yeah, all the franchises all around the country are owned, run, and operated by him. No one helped him build the company. He made all the pizzas, delivered them, etc.\n\nDon't buy the nonsense that a wealthy prick deserves EVERYTHING and no one else does. It's fallacious thinking.\n\nHe isn't a great American who loves his country; quite the opposite. He wants to keep all the money, put it in offshore accounts, pay no taxes, and have a workforce of Papa John's employees who have to be on welfare and food stamps because he pays them minimum wage.\n\nHe contributes NOTHING to America.\n\nHe's not a maker; he's a taker. In the worst possible way, too.\n\nindpendnt\n\nNovember 11, 2012 at 11:44 pm\n\n@RFGvac really? How many of you asshole invested you money and took a chance on a company? Bet you just work for one of these CUNTS! I think you should all quit your corporate positions and show these assholes what for! Show them how their company will fail without you! Cause another asshole like me will step in and gladly do that job to make him money. Guess what, I won't expect him to make a pittance and me to make an assload.\n\nRFGvac\n\nNovember 11, 2012 at 11:54 pm\n\n@indpendnt I've got a surprise for ya…help build a company, and the owner will sell out the first chance he gets when a larger corporation offers him a boatload of cash for the business. Then they come in and either clean house or cut your salary in half.\n\nRFGvac\n\nNovember 11, 2012 at 11:56 pm\n\n@indpendnt And I'm not saying it should be up to the government to tell these heartless cocksuckers what to do with their money. They should have a conscience and soul and do the right thing. Most don't, though. That's why I have zero admiration for them. He's not a success story in my eyes; he's a brutal dictator.\n\nindpendnt\n\nNovember 11, 2012 at 11:57 pm\n\n@RFGvac pretty sure he paid you wages to do a job, what the fuck did you invest? If you put money behind the company you deserve something.\n\nindpendnt\n\nNovember 11, 2012 at 11:58 pm\n\nTF does EVERYONE feel so entitled to Corporations money?\n\nRFGvac\n\nNovember 14, 2012 at 6:51 pm\n\n@indpendnt We're obviously never going to agree because you see the world in a black and white, cut and dry way. I happen to believe there are a lot more gray areas. Can we at least agree that the Right Wing of the Republican Party is laughable when it aligns itself with the ultra religious and tries to paint itself as the party of morality?\n\nThe CEO's and executives you worship are guilty of every single one of the 7 Deadly Sins that I learned about in my Catholic School days, and didn't Jesus himself say it was easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of Heaven?\n\nI guess God \"wants\" them to accumulate vast wealth at whatever cost, and rip off those beneath him.\n\nAs long as they're anti-abortion, Jesus is on their side!\n\nindpendnt\n\nNovember 14, 2012 at 7:05 pm\n\n@RFGvac Black and White? Cut and dry? It is either fact or a \"grey\" area, at least I don't try and justify my points with emotion, I use facts and details which are obviously translucent to a liberal like yourself. I am a conservative Independent thinker. I don't give a shit about the religious view.\n\nI also don't worship any CEO, Executive or Corporation. I'm sure you feel it's a sin to make money. But these people that were working for him were paid well, had benefits and were happy. Otherwise they were stupid to be working there. You claim they shouldn't make profits? Why the fuck would you risk your money and efforts to become successful? How do you know what he does with the profits? Maybe he is creating jobs through other ventures? What the fuck business is it of yours anyway? You act like an angry ex-wife that has done nothing with her life. Acting like an OLD WOMAN!\n\nRFGvac\n\nNovember 14, 2012 at 8:11 pm\n\n@indpendnt HAHAHA! I'm no liberal, trust me. I'm no conservative, either. The fact that you identify yourself as a \"conservative Independent\" is an oxymoron. If you're subscribing to an established ideal, you're no longer an independent thinker.\n\nAnd your \"facts\" are not facts; they're what YOU believe. That doesn't make them the truth.\n\nA Christian will say that it's a fact that Jesus Christ is the Son of God.\n\nMillions of others wouldn't agree that it's a fact.\n\nindpendnt\n\nNovember 14, 2012 at 8:27 pm\n\n@RFGvac your views certainly are liberal. You are suppose to be college educated. Independant is someone who isn't Dem or Rep. Conservative is someone who KNOWS the Government SQUANDERS money, and is tired of paying TAXES while they spend all their budgets just so they don't lose any budget allocated for the next year. Or while I feel a woman has the right to choose to have an abortion, I shouldn't be made to assist in the financial responsibility if I didn't knock her up.\n\nWhat fact isn't a fact? The fact that Papa John risked his own money and effort to build his business? The fact that he paid his employees a fair wage? The fact he offered benefits to them? The fact that Obamacare has driven the cost of healthcare to 3X what it was prior, so he can no longer run a business without losing prior profits and closing them all?\n\nThis is exactly why those living on the Government tit (IE Government Employee) are overpaid compared to the private sector and our Government is losing TRILLIONS of dollars. It isn't sustainable. But you've never tried to be a real businessman.\n\nCigarsAndscotch1\n\nNovember 11, 2012 at 9:25 pm\n\nShame on anyone with more than me. Do we really want to live in a world where CEOs of successfull companies have nice homes? He should just absorb the costs of Obamacare let his company fail.\n\nindpendnt\n\nNovember 11, 2012 at 9:30 pm\n\n@CigarsAndscotch1 how DARE YOU talk common sense?\n\nOprahs moose knuckle\n\nNovember 11, 2012 at 9:34 pm\n\n@CigarsAndscotch1 Well said\n\nOprahs moose knuckle\n\nNovember 11, 2012 at 9:33 pm\n\nHere we go again…eat the rich. Question: how many blue collar people did he employ when he built that castle? How many is he employing currently with the upkeep? When he is building new stores? I work hard so I can one day be wealthy like that. Why is it acceptable for rap stars/rock stars, sports stars,etc to be rich and flaunt their money, but when it's someone who makes a LEGAL business decision, they are vilified? It's a publicly traded company, and if I was a shareholder I would applaud his decision to save the company money so share price would go up and they wouldn't necessarily have to raise the price of pizzas to cover the cost of Obamacare. 50% of the population are invested in the stock market, so if you have a 401(k) or own mutual funds, you own stock in these \"evil\" corporations.\n\nezbradley\n\nNovember 11, 2012 at 10:01 pm\n\nI work for Papa Johns. I think the plan is to limit the hours of most non-management employees to less than the 30 hour part-time threshold. We will not be eligible for company insurance. I'm sure we will be eligible for whatever government subsidized healthcare is available. People willing to work and pay for their own insurance will not be given the opportunity.\nIf ever there were something that needs to be socialized, it's medicine. We all get sick. We all (hopefully) get old. We all get hurt. Healthcare should never have been tied to your employment in the first place. Why should your health ever be tied to the health of the company you work for?\n\nindpendnt\n\nNovember 11, 2012 at 10:06 pm\n\n@ezbradley why should doctors and dentist give away their work for a subsidized fee? Should you? Everyone eats, shouldn't food be free with that example? Everyone needs a place to stay, should that be free too?\n\nezbradley\n\nNovember 11, 2012 at 10:18 pm\n\n@indpendnt Yes, everyone should eat and have a place to live. I see no problem with a social safety net for those who need it. We can all look out for each other and still amass wealth and live comfortable lives. No one's asking anybody to sell their golf course.\n\nindpendnt\n\nNovember 11, 2012 at 10:22 pm\n\n@ezbradley what about those who'd rather do drugs and have you pay the bills? You do understand that EVERYONE should eat for free and have free housing under your concept. EVEN THE RICH THAT YOU HATE?\n\nezbradley\n\nNovember 11, 2012 at 10:47 pm\n\n@indpendnt There are many people society would deem failures, often due to their own actions. I will not begrudge them food, shelter and healthcare. And rich people are just people, there are no caste here. I don't hate them or begrudge them their wealth. But if you take more you're going to have to kick back more.\n\nindpendnt\n\nNovember 11, 2012 at 10:52 pm\n\n@ezbradley what? you begrudge them for taking a risk and being successful! Why not make those able to work on welfare to go pick up trash etc.? Maybe find roads to pave to help pay for their meals?\n\nBeer\n\nNovember 12, 2012 at 7:57 am\n\n@indpendnt @ezbradley Try to get a great lawyer for free…they won't meddle in that because most politicians are or serve lawyers\n\nindpendnt\n\nNovember 12, 2012 at 8:36 am\n\n@Beer @ezbradley but why shouldn't that be free too?

He, the Papa Johns guy, announced in august that he would do this and spoke about it at Wednesday night after the election. Nobody out words in his mouth, nobody made assumptions abouy what he meant. He gratuitously declared it…which makes him sound like a crybaby douche..which was my point.

Telling lazy people they're right for not trying because they are owed a living and but for evil rich people we'd all be millionaires. So the lazy fat 39 year old who still lives in mom's basement playing computer games and eating hot pockets all day and is on the dole because of his \"carpal tunnel\" and the fact he only works 12 hours a week at the hobby store so as not to cut into his gaming time hears this shit and thinks \"she's right I'm only in this position because fat cat assholes are conspiring to keep me down\". \"I'm going to vote for her so I can continue doing my civic duty (nothing) and she'll make those rich sons of bitches pay their far share so I can finally get what I'm owed\".

And with even a shotglass full of sense you would realize that the current employer-based insurance coverage system is wack and that Obamacare, far from being a socialist plot is actually a good first step to bring some market dicipline and efficiency to the provision of healthcare in this country.\nAnd if your primary argument about the efficacy of capitalism doesn't rise above the Cumian School party line of \"I earned it all myself and its all mine!

{"text": "sitemeter\n\nFebruary 07, 2006\n\nBetty Friedan and Working Women\n\nBetty Friedandied over the weekend, at 85.I read her most famous book, The Feminine Mystique as an undergraduate in a feminist theory course. Her book, a founding text of second-wave feminism,analyzes and decries \"the problem that had no name,\" the anomie and discontent of educated, middle-class women who had no practical alternative to a stultifying, suburban existence of tending to home, husband, and children – women who got everything they thought they wanted and were then left asking themselves, \"Is that all?\"\n\nI remember feeling a sense of gratitude when I read the book:in significant part because of books like hers, the world that she described wasn't the world I expected to inhabit.But accompanying that sense of gratitude was an equally strong feeling of disconnection: the recent past that she described was a foreign country, not a place that struck me as familiar.These problems, I thought, weren't my problems.\n\nI'm now struck – and slightly embarrassed – by howdisconnected I felt from what she described.I grew up in a milieu in which, quite honestly, it truly never occurred to me that I wouldn't have a professional life.Back when I was a junior in college reading her book, I didn't know what I'd be – journalist? Lawyer? Anthropologist? – butI certainly knew that I'd never identify with the label 'housewife'!.I vaguely expected to have a family someday too, and perhaps I even wondered every now and then about how I'd juggle the various roles, though I suspect that I didn't give those matters too much detailed thought back in those days.Why couldn't I have it all?\n\nNo doubt the world is a very different place now than when Betty Friedan published her book in 1963.And yet:I look around at my friends, at my law school classmates, at the people all around me, and I am struck by what an enormous number of talented, highly educated women are choosing to forego their professional lives in order to stay at home with their families.(We don't talk abouthousewives any more, of course; the terminology du jour is the 'stay-at-home-mom'.)\n\nThe present is, of course, very different from the post-world-war-two landscape about which Friedan is writing: for one thing, for most of today's well-educated women, staying at home is genuinely a choice as opposed to the only socially and institutionally-sanctioned alternative.(And it goes without saying that class plays a central role here: it's a choice available only to the immensely privileged few who can possibly afford it.)\n\nThe return-by-choice to an updated version of the domestic fantasy of the 50s has been much commented upon – think, for example, of Lisa Belkin's much-analyzed (in my circles, anyway) 2003 NYT magazine piece on female Princeton grads and the 'opt-out' revolution, or the Times' more recent survey of female Yale undergraduates, many of whom expect to leave the workplace when they became mothers. Part of it, I think, stems from the simple reality that for many women, the working world turned out to be less than it seemed.If, as Friedan stirringly described,home and hearth can be sources of discontent that lead to silent yearning, so, it turns out, can 65 hour-a-week jobs, constant corporate jockeying, workplace cultures that value infinite 'face-time' in the office, and business reorganizations so frequent that no one ever gets a handle on their job.\n\nNo doubt there are a lot of stay-at-home mothers who are less happy than they'd like to admit. And yes, from my perspective, it does seem like the new stay-at-home ideology invites a certain degree of unjustified martyrdom and self-sacrifice. I admit it: some stay-at-home mothers seem so invested in their children's every move that it makes me squirm. But I have no doubt there are also a lot of unhappy corporate lawyers too.And those who try to juggle both professional and personal lives can feel dissatisfied and inadequate in both their realms.\n\nStill, as one who makes the choice every day to juggle both roles, I wouldn't have it any other way. But I'm struck that when I think about Friedan now, 20 years after I read her landmark book, the world that she describes resonates more with me today than it did when I first laid eyes on it.\n\nComments\n\n\"I admit it: some stay-at-home mothers seem so invested in their children's every move that it makes me squirm.\" Well, this is just the domestic counterpart of the brutally competitive corporate professional, invested in some market's every move, so to speak. Both are caricatures, which doesn't necessarily mean they are any less obnoxious. At a certain level, Friedan was most interested in breaking down a system, probably considerably less so in the individual personality quirks that would emerge from the result.", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "3422c47e-9c6b-4c13-8ea5-3f296b8bfcae", "url": "http://lawculture.blogs.com/lawculture/2006/02/betty_friedan_a.html"}
{"text": "Opening Segment and Championship Celebration Announced for RAW\n\nBy Amish Patel -\nOctober 28, 2013\n\n– WWE has announced on their website that the opening segment of tonight's RAW will feature the newly crowned World Heavyweight Champion John Cena addressing the live audience in Orlando. Here is an excerpt from their announcement:\n\n\"Some said he returned too soon. Others claimed Alberto Del Rio would show no mercy on John Cena's ailing left arm. At Hell in a Cell, see how Cena proved all the naysayers wrong and captured his 14th World Title. Tonight, The Champ addresses the WWE Universe at the start of Raw at 8/7 CT on USA.\"\n\n– Stephanie McMahon announced on Twitter that new WWE Champion Randy Orton will have a Championship Celebration on tonight's show. She tweeted:\n\n\"Tonight @RandyOrton Championship Celebration! Plus, John Cena, the new World Champion returns to #Raw for the 1st time in over 2 months!\"\n\nPost Views: 1\n\nPost navigation\n\nWell I mean Orton and Cena are champions.. oh yeah same guys, uh the last wwe champion was Cena, then Rock, uh, oh yeah same guys and nobody else, well the world title gets around, Orton and Sheamus, huh, same champions, *sigh* I guess I couldn't prove you wrong, WWE just hands the same guys the same titles.\n\nat least WWE hasn't put the world title around a celebrity yet like WCW did, but sadly I fear that when the muppets come back, Kermit the Frog will have his reign as champion *sigh*.\n\nKristopher Robinson\n\nVery well said.\n\nKristopher Robinson\n\nI agree, but Cena isn't the only superstar in the locker room. This company is turnin into wCw and it's the same champions over and over and over again. It makes the WHC look weaker bc if Cena doesn't have it then is at the same level as the US and IC title.\n\nJohnCena33\n\nSince your other comment is awaiting moderation, i will reply to this one.\n\nCena does wrestle a couple times of week and sadly will probably be a lifer in the business. The only reason Cena does not turn heel is make a wish. All of those kids that look to him for hope, Cena would never turn his back on that, although it hurts his in ring career, it just helps his life outside the ring that much more, if there was no make a wish, cena would turn heel, and I honestly think we would see the greatest heel turn and heel promos of possibly all time, maybe that is just me being too much of a Cena fan, but he has the ability to be a top level heel, but we will never truly know.\n\nkamalas leg\n\nI will never argue that Cena doesn't love the business and works his ass off. He grew up a true fan like the rest of us. But as far as making the most money? I don't know about that. Think Hulk Hogan from 1983 – 1993. Think Stone Cold circa 1997 – 2002. (Also because wwe over sells merchandise, toys, etc down the youths throat.) What if Hogan sold more than one color T-shirt. Think about it)\nBut to compare Flair's passion to Cena is hard to do. Times are different. Flair would wrestle 5 or 6 times a week every week for years. Every country, every territory. A true World Champion. When Cena is still relevant in wrestling conversations in 2035 then I'll say OK, he's the man.\nMost true fans hate his corny catchphrases and over the top try to be the top good guy too much act.\nI respect him. The make a wish kids, TV appearances, work ethic, helping younger talent, and what he does for pro wrestling by being a global star. Will I ever chear him? No. I'm too old school. When he grabs the mic, rips off his colorful t shirt and tells the fans to stick it, then I'll cheer lol. Flair said a long time ago: \"to be a good pro wrestler, you have to be a good face and better heal. That's why Ricky Steamboat isn't as remembered as he should be.\"\n\nEnd of the history lessons for today\n\nJohnCena33\n\nThanks for the list. I never really liked Flairs style of wrestling, so I am glad Cena will break the record, he deserves it, he loves the business, does the job well, and has made wwe the most money. I just dont understand why people complain about Cena winning the title, guess they are jealous.\n\nRocco Hunsinger\n\nDel Taco did nothing for the title after his heel turn…\n\neveryone knows John will make the whc matter me the del taco ever could.\n\nkamalas leg\n\nHate to say it, but Flairs reign at the top may be in jeopardy.Which means Cena may be sitting on top of the list for a long time. Not the biggest Cena fan, but Hear me out:\n\n6 (marked with *) of the top 10 are no longer active\n2 (Sting and Angle) probably don't have enough time left in their careers\n1 has just 10. (Randy Orton) as much time as he disappears from the title picture, I doubt it.", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "4158517e-3bbb-480f-b708-f82eb2e54d35", "url": "http://wrestling-edge.com/opening-segment-championship-celebration-announced-raw/"}
{"text": "American Cancer Society to close its local office\n\nVICTORVILLE• The local office of the American Cancer Society won't be open after Dec. 1 - at least not without some generous intervention.\n\nThe change is part of a statewide shift to more regionalized offices - the closest being Riverside - in the face of dwindling sponsorships and statewide cutbacks.\n\nWhile it won't mean the end of local services, the closing means volunteers are scrambling to find another meeting place for their local support groups, as well as storage space for their supplies.\n\n\"A girl came in today to pick out a wig for her mom who is going through chemotherapy,\" said Marjorie Barnes, one of 10 volunteers with the local chapter. \"That kind of thing, it seems to us, is an important part of the service rather than just calling an 800 number.\"\n\nBetween calls and visits, Barnes said they serve at least six to eight people a day.\n\n\" We have to sometimes make decisions that are not well received,\" said Stephen Browning, regional vice president for the American Cancer Society. \"But they are fiscally responsible decisions and it's important to know that they're not done without a great deal of thought.\"\n\nIn the wake of a \"challenging fundraising year,\" Browning said the American Cancer Society faced its most significant staff reduction in recent history this week, laying off 16 percent of its work force.\n\n\"It causes us to look at all of our operational expenditures,\" Browning said. \"It cost us over $16,000 to keep that office open last year. We simply don't have those dollars this year.\"\n\nPart of the shortfall came from corporate sponsors, including Desert Community Bank, who had supplemented the office's lease since December 2006, not renewing their partnership.\n\n\"We're doing our best and trying to do as much as we can while the economy is like this,\" said Emily Wang, director of marketing for DCB's parent company East West Bank. \"Our commitment to the community has never changed. But it's been a very, very tough year. We are posting losses right now, not profits. We hope that the community organizations can understand, and that we can work together again when the economy improves.\"\n\nBrowning said the American Cancer Society would love to keep a local office open, but that the space and the utilities would have to be completely donated.\n\nIn the meantime, Browning said they don't need to have a physical office to provide the services the community has depended on, and that operations such as the 24/7 Service Center will not be diminished.\n\nHe also said they're working with the volunteers to find free space for the support groups that meet regularly.", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "78b03f8b-bfc9-4c90-83c3-0e63f9b05a8e", "url": "http://www.vvdailypress.com/article/20080929/NEWS/309299986"}

{"text": "Search\n\nJuly – The Innocence Mission\n\nThis barren July We both wake up so dry That no more tears can leave us. And all we've found Are roads we can't go down, Eyes on a day we can't see. I hope it comes. I hope that water comes And drenches us in our clothes. The world at night Has seen the greatest light. Too much light to deny.\n\nWe've been married eight months now. Eight glorious, wondersome moons. Ever more aware of the riches of our union.\n\nSometimes I'm smitten by it. The daily thrills and excitements. Could anything be more joyfullest than to wake next to the one you love best in the world? To be able to serve them soul and mind and body? Even the simplest of duties are driven by a great contentment. Like making breakfast or folding clothes. For someone besides and beside me.\n\nIt's a beautiful life.\n\nToo much light to deny.\n\nWith all love comes yearning.\n\nAnd while there is no desperation or unusual space, yet.\n\nWe are waiting. We are desiring.\n\nThe surprise has worn off slightly. The shock of what seemed the \"next thing\" not entering. The first few months were such a strange dose of keen disappointment. I didn't know I would desire a baby that quickly and fiercely. So that the cycling \"no\" sent me reeling.\n\nThen the months of willing it…\n\n'If only I could FEEL pregnant it might happen'.\n\n'If I pray harder, if he prays harder.'\n\n'If I ignore the lack.'\n\n'If I prove my want.'\n\n'If I prove my contentment.'\n\n'If I prove my worth.'\n\nUnderstand:\n\nThis isn't a plea of pity. I'm not worthy to bear the honour of being one who has waited. I know women who have lived lives open and empty for much longer a time. Who have lost unborn and still placed themselves smiling in front of His throne. The admiration I have for those women is thick. They truly have been conformed to His image.\n\nThis is me stepping back and seeing the story.\n\nBecause till I do I can't play my character with grace Chesterton\n\n(This includes me and my husband)\n\nThe desire for children is a constant thread through my wifehood. It's a chord that plays beneath every day…\n\nSome days it's frenzied dirge.\n\nSome days it's a gentle hum.\n\nSome days it's a playful chant.\n\nThere are times when everything pounds to that sound, others where it's so quiet as to be ignored.\n\nYet never forgotten.\n\nIn my head there are facets of this chord.\n\nHere are the bits that shine brightest these days. The sides that are pronounced and understandable to me.\n\nI'm sure there will come more facets to be seen in the coming months. Thus the glory of God's molding.\n\nFacet One\n\nSeparateness of This Honeymoon\n\nToday I brought my husband lunch and sat on a wood-dusted floor to watch him work. We talked uninterrupted about this subject and other lighter ones.\n\nWe both slept through the night and I showered with the leisure of a queen.\n\nA baby would bring a halt to some great moments that are normal to us. While we wait for that halt with open arms, it would be foolish to dismiss the blessings we stand in. They are great. I can give all my attention to my Lover and him to me. We can pick up and leave for a weekend with little repercussion. Our money is loosely budgeted and involves delicacies that would need garnering.\n\nFacet Two\n\nThe Ever Remembrance Of Motherhood\n\nI'm a nanny. For two beautiful, well loved girls. They are a constant light to me. I love them dearly. More than just about any small persons.\n\nWhen people find out my occupation they often remark, \"what good practice you are getting!\" Which is true. Not always in the way they may think though. I have practiced how to curb my own selfishness, my own anger or disgust. To give my energy fully. To have a plan and adapt it. To love without return. To accept love when it's undeserved.\n\nI've watched those girls grow and change beneath my heart. It's the most humbling thing. Particularly when my heart is growing and changing more violently.\n\nThe other element of being around babes with such consistency is that I'm always keeping my mother-self in the open. I can't put it away in the drawer. It's ever before me.\n\nThere are those moments where that seems taunting, cruel… But most of the time, when I am being obedient the shadow of my mother-self is hopeful. This is how I keep my desire before my Lord.\n\nThis is how I…\n\nSing, O barren, You who have not borne! Break forth into singing, and cry aloud, You who have not labored with child! For more are the children of the desolate Than the children of the married woman,\" says the LORD. \" Enlarge the place of your tent, And let them stretch out the curtains of your dwellings; Do not spare; Lengthen your cords, And strengthen your stakes.\n\nIsaiah 54\n\nIt's how my God calls me to bravery. To keep all the reaches of myself supple and aired. A set part of my life put aside for offspring. Now to put in the Missies from time to time… At His time to put my own Missies and Misters.\n\nI\"m so thankful for my 'job'.\n\nFacet Three\n\nThanksgiving, Trust, Thirst\n\nGod creates places. He's a tangible Creator. There are empty places in which to fill. Wastelands to flood.\n\nI'm thankful for every passing month because it makes more keen and clean the barren place which He will overflow. Just as the hole in my heart became Goodman shaped by hard burning and carving. I'm thankful for the years without so that I may know the comfort of with.\n\nHe knows me best. Knows how precious something must become to me before I fear it's weight and give it to Him.\n\nBoth my husband and I.\n\nWe are thankful that He knows our desire.\n\nThankful that He has ordained it's fulfillment.\n\nOur thirst becomes great and it will be quenched by such sweetness.\n\nPsalm 113\n\nWho is like the LORD our God, Who dwells on high, Who humbles Himself to behold The things that are in the heavens and in the earth?\n\nHe raises the poor out of the dust, And lifts the needy out of the ash heap, That He may seat him with princes— With the princes of His people.

Entitlement to service connection for bilateral shoulder bursitis.\n2. Entitlement to service connection for post-operative residuals of right shoulder rotator cuff repair.\n3. Entitlement to service connection for post-operative residuals of left shoulder impingement syndrome repair.\nREPRESENTATION\nAppellant represented by: Disabled American Veterans\nATTORNEY FOR THE BOARD\nD. Rogers, Associate Counsel\nINTRODUCTION\nThe Veteran served on active duty from January 1955 to January 1957.\nThis appeal initially came before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from an August 2007 rating decision by the Regional Office (RO) of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) in New York, New York, which in pertinent part, denied entitlement to service connection for the disorders noted on the cover sheet. In December 2010, the Board remanded this case for additional development. The case has been returned to the Board for further asserts that his current shoulder disorders had their onset during service following prolonged cold weather exposure therein. He reportedly performed daily patrols of the border between Germany and Czechoslovakia in an area then known as \"The Iron Curtain.\" Patrols were purportedly performed daily in an open jeep in sub-zero temperatures during periods of rain, snow, and sleet. He states that his shoulders were often wet, numb and painful and he recalled having to pound on them to get his circulation going. At night, he slept in an outpost. He reports continued bilateral shoulder pain since discharge that he has self-treated with the application of heat.\nCorrespondence received from the National Personnel Records Center in June 2007 shows that the Veteran's service treatment records are fire-related and unavailable. It was noted that if the Veteran had alleged treatment during service, necessary information should be supplied to code MO5.\nIn an April 2006 statement, the Veteran reported that he sought treatment for shoulder pain during service which was allegedly diagnosed as bursitis. He also stated that he also sought treatment while attending a seven week leadership course at the Seventh Army NCO Academy in Munich, Germany.\nAlthough the Veteran returned an incomplete NA Form 15033 in July 2007 indicating that he was unsure of the dates, times, and locations that he received treatment for shoulder pain, copies of U.S. Army certificates submitted by the Veteran show that he received a certificate of proficiency from the 7th Army NCO Academy in March 1956. Accordingly, a request should be made for any clinical treatment records or morning reports pertaining to the Veteran and any treatment received for shoulder pain or bursitis for the period of January 6 to March 6, 1956, while assigned to Company E, 2nd Battalion, 6th Armored Calvary Regiment, APO 225 while stationed at the Seventh Army NCO Academy in Munich, Germany. The record also shows service in Rohrnbach, Germany in December 1956.\nIt should be noted that the Veteran's given first name of \"Efthimios\" was legally changed to Thomas at the time of his naturalization as a citizen of the United States in May 1955. Because the Veteran's given name was shown on copies of U.S. Army certificates, etc., efforts to secure all pertinent records should include requests for treatment records under both the Veteran's given and legal names.\nReview of the record also shows that the Veteran has received ongoing private clinical and surgical treatment for complaints of bilateral shoulder pain since at least 1995 at Western Nassau Orthopaedic Associates of Mineola, New York. Only limited treatment records from this provider have been obtained and associated with the record. Although the most recent treatment record from this facility is dated April 2006, VA treatment records show that as recent as 2012, the Veteran has reportedly received ongoing private treatment for shoulder pain. Additional relevant medical records, if any, should be obtained. 38 C.F.R. § 3.159(c)(2).\nIn accordance with the Board's December 2010 remand, a VA examination was conducted in February 2011. An addendum opinion was provided by the same examiner in May 2012. Although the examiner stated that the claims folder was reviewed, the examination report states that the Veteran denied seeking treatment for shoulder pain in service. Similarly, her rationale appears to rely significantly on the fact that there was no evidence of medical treatment of the bilateral shoulders during service. This suggests that the examiner was unaware that the Veteran's service treatment records are missing through no fault of his own. Moreover, there is no indication that the examiner considered the Veteran's or T.N.'s lay statements of record which indicate that the Veteran did seek treatment for shoulder pain during service, and shortly following discharge, he continued to experience shoulder pain that he attributed to cold weather exposure during service. The above evidence is competent, see 38 C.F.R. § 3.159(a)(2) (2011), as both the Veteran and his friend are capable to describe symptoms experienced or observed.\nAdditionally, correspondence received from the Veteran since the February 2011 VA examination questions the adequacy of that examination and the May 2012 opinion. The appellant stated that due to scheduling conflicts/errors at the VA Medical Center, the examination was ultimately performed by a physician's assistant rather than by an orthopedic physician. He said that the examiner did not ask any questions about shoulder pain during service but questioned him about his childhood. He too pointed out that the examiner did not take his own or T.N.'s lay statements regarding his cold weather exposure and shoulder pain during and after service into account. In light of the foregoing, and because the Board directed that the examination be conducted by a physician, not a physician's assistant, further development is required. Stegall v. West, 11 Vet. App. 268 (1998 complete a request to the National Personnel Records Center for any morning reports or clinical treatment records pertaining to both the Veteran's given and legal names and any treatment received for shoulder pain or bursitis during the period of January 6 to March 6, 1956 and December 1956 while assigned to Company E, 2nd Battalion, 6th Armored Calvary Regiment, APO 225 while stationed at the Seventh Army NCO Academy in Munich, Germany. The recommended procedures outlined in the June 2007 response from the National Personnel Records Center for obtaining records of treatment must be completed.\nIf the RO/AMC cannot locate such records, the RO/AMC must specifically document the attempts that were made to locate them, and explain in writing why further attempts to locate or obtain these records would be futile (i.e., a memorandum of formal finding of unavailability). The RO/AMC should request all relevant VA medical records from the Northport, New York VA Medical Center dating since March 2012. All records obtained should be associated with the claims file.\n3. The RO/AMC should send the Veteran a letter requesting that he submit authorization to enable VA to obtain all clinical treatment records from the Western Nassau Orthopedic Clinic located in Mineola, New York to include all records dating since a 1995 right shoulder operation. All attempts to secure this evidence should be documented in the claims file.\n4. Thereafter, the RO/AMC must obtain a medical opinion from a VA orthopedic physician to determine the nature, onset, and etiology of the Veteran's claimed bilateral shoulder disabilities of bursitis and post-operative residuals of a rotator cuff repair of the right shoulder and of an impingement syndrome repair of the left shoulder. The claims folder, to include any relevant records contained in Virtual VA, and a copy of this REMAND must be made available to the orthopedist. The orthopedist must acknowledge his/her review of Virtual VA, and specifically state the range of dates of the records reviewed on Virtual VA.\nThe orthopedist is to opine whether it is at least as likely as not, i.e., is there a 50/50 chance, that any diagnosed shoulder disorder is related to service, to include service in a cold weather environment. All opinions must be fully explained and the rationale provided. In preparing the requested opinions, the orthopedist must consider the lay statements of the Veteran and T.N.\nIf the orthopedist is unable to provide any of the requested opinions that fact must be stated and the reasons why explained. That is, the examining orthopedist must specifically explain why the causation of a diagnosed shoulder disorder is unknowable.\n5. After the development requested has been completed, the RO/AMC should review the examination report to ensure that it is in complete compliance with the directives of this REMAND. The RO must ensure that the orthopedist has documented their review of Virtual VA. If the report is deficient in any manner, the RO must implement corrective procedures at once.\n6. Upon completion of the above requested development and any additional development deemed appropriate, the RO must readjudicate the issues of entitlement to service connection for bilateral shoulder bursitis, post-operative residuals of right shoulder rotator cuff repair, and post-operative residuals of left shoulder impingement syndrome repair. All evidence added to the case and all applicable laws and regulations should be considered.

You can read part one here, part two here and part three here. The fourth type of diaper that I will review in this series are called Genki (large 9-14kg, pants type). They are made by Nepia and you can find their website here (Japanese only).\nI bought a pack of 42 large diapers from Nishimatsuya for 1029yen (thats 24.5yen per diaper). They are more expensive on Amazon.co.jp, where they are 35yen per diaper.\n\nGenki diapers feature the Japanese character Anpanman and his friends. The diapers have different designs that I have photographed below. The front of the diaper is marked with まえ (front), and the back is clearly marked with tape which you can use to wrap up the diaper for disposal.\n\nFront and back\n\nFront and back\n\nPros - cute Anpanman design - there is a wetness indicator on the diapers - very soft materials with a looser waistband\nCons - I have not seen these diapers in a lot of places, so they might be harder to buy if you don`t live near a big baby store like Nishimatsuya. Aiden is a big drinker, and usually goes through a lot of diapers each day. During our use of Genki diapers, we had only 1 or 2 leaks or overflows (at night only). For that reason, and the fact that they are super soft, I might use these diapers again! *This is not a sponsored post.

As a Technology Advocate, Clarke was recognized for his outstanding leadership in assisting, advancing and accelerating the performance of tech communities and the community.\n\nClarke has spent the past 40+ years of his career identifying opportunities for technology to revolutionize \"business as usual.\" His first major contribution began in 1976 at Control Data, where he developed software to deliver the very first computer-based exam for Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (NASD) at the time. So if you've taken a computer-based test at any point in your life, you've got Clarke to thank for that.\n\nClarke followed up by developing the concept of IT certification with Novell, co-founding Virtual University Enterprise (now Pearson VUE), and leading the development of a cloud-based credential solution.

{"text": "HP Moonshot 1500 Software Defined Capable Compute Servers\n\nRiding the current software defined data center (SDC) wave being led by the likes of VMware and software defined networking (SDN) also championed by VMware via their acquisition of Nicera last year, Software Defined Marketing (SDM) is in full force. HP being a player in providing the core building blocks for traditional little data and big data, along with physical, virtual, converged, cloud and software defined has announced a new compute, processor or server platform called the Moonshot 1500.\n\nSoftware defined marketing aside, there are some real and interesting things from a technology standpoint that HP is doing with the Moonshot 1500 along with other vendors who are offering micro server based solutions.\n\nFirst, for those who see server (processor and compute) improvements as being more and faster cores (and threads) per socket, along with extra memory, not to mention 10GbE or 40GbE networking and PCIe expansion or IO connectivity, hang on to your hats.\n\nMoonshot is in the model of the micro servers or micro blades such as what HP has offered in the past along with the likes of Dell and Sea Micro (now part of AMD). The micro servers are almost the opposite of the configuration found on regular servers or blades where the focus is putting more ability on a motherboard or blade.\n\nWith micro servers the approach support those applications and environments that do not need lots of CPU processing capability, large amount of storage or IO or memory. These include some web hosting or cloud application environments that can leverage more smaller, lower power, less performance or resource intensive platforms. For example big data (or little data) applications whose software or tools benefit from many low-cost, low power, and lower performance with distributed, clustered, grid, RAIN or ring based architectures can benefit from this type of solution.\n\nWhat is the Moonshot 1500 system?\n\n4.3U high rack mount chassis that holds up to 45 micro servers\n\nEach hot-swap micro server is its own self-contained module similar to blade server\n\nServer modules install vertically from the top into the chassis similar to some high-density storage enclosures\n\nCompute or processors are Intel Atom S1260 2.0GHz based processors with 1 MB of cache memory\n\nChassis and enclosure management along with ACPI 2.0b, SMBIOS 2.6.1 and PXE support\n\nA pair of Ethernet switches each give up to six x 10GbE uplinks for the Moonshot chassis\n\nDual RJ-45 connectors for iLO chassis management are also included\n\nStatus LEDs on the front of each chassis providers status of the servers and network switches\n\nSupport for Canonical Ubuntu 12.04, RHEL 6.4, SUSE Linux LES 11 SP2\n\nNotice a common theme with moonshot along with other micro server-based systems and architectures?\n\nCIO, CTO & Developer Resources\n\nIf not, it is simple, I mean literally simple and flexible is the value proposition.\n\nSimple is the theme (with software defined for marketing) along with low-cost, lower energy power demand, lower performance, less of what is not needed to remove cost.\n\nGranted not all applications will be a good fit for micro servers (excuse me, software defined servers) as some will need the more robust resources of traditional servers. With solutions such as HP Moonshot, system architects and designers have more options available to them as to what resources or solution options to use. For example, a cloud or object storage system based solutions that does not need a lot of processing performance per node or memory, and a low amount of storage per node might find this as an interesting option for mid to entry-level needs.\n\nWill HP release a version of their Lefthand or IBRIX (both since renamed) based storage management software on these systems for some market or application needs?\n\nHow about deploying NoSQL type tools including Cassandra or Mongo, how about CloudStack, OpenStack Swift, Basho Riak (or Riak CS) or other software including object storage, on these types of solutions, or web servers and other applications that do not need the fastest processors or most memory per node?\n\nThus micro server-based solutions such as Moonshot enable return on innovation (the new ROI) by enabling customers to leverage the right tool (e.g. hard product) to create their soft product allowing their users or customers to in turn innovate in a cost-effective way Dev", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "1859a3ab-90b8-48ce-be37-bc6265644e9c", "url": "http://soa.sys-con.com/node/2608888"}

It is said that Kirankumar doesn't like KVP at all and asked the Konda couple to write such an open letter to blame KVP. Such a letter is bound to cause anger to Jagan creating a distance between him and Surekha. The Konda couple might be looking for such a situation exactly.\n\nIt is also said that the Konda couple decided to keep off Jagan gradually and are looking for some convenience. Hence, they have readily agreed to the suggestion of CM to target KVP. It might be mentioned that Surekha has been repeatedly telling that they would make Jagan agree for the demand of separate Telangana knowing full well that he won't agree for separate Telangana being a hard core protagonist of united AP.\n\nIt would be easier for Surekha to come out of the Jagan group blaming him that he was not willing for Telangana.\n\nHer yesterday's remarks that she would continue to fight on behalf of Jagan while continuing in congress if necessary strengthen these rumours.

We played a better game. They've also dropped each of their last five home playoff games.\n\n3rd Star: Torrey Mitchell - Mitchell scored the Canadiens only goal and, along with Steve Ott and Dwight King, gave the Canadiens some much needed energy in a game where they were far less determined than the Rangers.\n\nInjuries forced them to somewhat abandon that strategy, but with a seemingly healthy roster, Alain Vigneault has opted for grind. \"They executed a pretty good game plan. He made the right play when it was there and was key to get that goal for us\".\n\nUnlike Game 2 in Montreal, where the Rangers couldn't protect a one-goal lead late, they got the job done Tuesday night despite almost allowing the equalizer when Habs' defenseman Shea Weber's shot from the point clanked off the post. The Habs were already 0-2 on the power play for the night but did find their game and applied some pressure, highlighted by a quickly released shot by Lekhonen in the slot and a nice save by Lundqvist on a point shot in traffic.\n\nThe New York Rangers were within 18 seconds of taking a commanding 2-0 lead with two road wins, setting up a clear path to a first-round win and nullifying this very column idea.\n\n\"Every time you win you kind of change the momentum\", Plekanec said. \"So we worked really hard until the end and made some big plays and some big blocks when we had to\".\n\nCALGARY, Alberta | Corey Perry scored 1:30 into overtime and the Anaheim Ducks rallied from three goals down to take a 3-0 series lead in the first-round series. Andrew Shaw failed to finish a breakaway on Lundqvist who turned away Shaw's attempt confidently.\n\nFast opened the scoring at 11:39 with his first of the of the playoffs.\n\nIn the second period, the Rangers were outplayed by the Canadiens yet again. It is the right move, as the Rangers need to employ a more offensive unit, as it could jump start their speed game.\n\nTo start the third period, the Rangers committed another penalty, this time to Mats Zuccarello for a four-minute minor.\n\nMontreal coach Claude Julien said he would announce any potential lineup changes Sunday before adding an illness has \"been going around\" the team. \"In the playoffs, you can't afford any weak links and we didn't have any\". The One Where Tomas Plekanec Scores With 17.3 Seconds Left In The Third Period - or 29 more than Price. That gave the Blueshirts a 2-1 lead they would take into the third period. Ryan McDonagh kept the puck in the zone and sent a nice pass to Nash near the front of the net and he slipped a backhand past Price at 4:28 for his second of the series.\n\n\"I told him first playoff game\", said Vigneault of a pre-game conversation with Buchnevich. For fans who have followed the past decade of playoff runs, this is an early sign of a troubling trend: The Rangers failure to close out and limit their playoff games hurts their playoff outlook. D Nick Holden was also in the lineup.\n\nAnd, in doing so the Rangers - gasp - won a playoff game at Madison Square Garden, snapping a six-game losing streak dating to Game 2 of the 2015 Eastern Conference final against the Lightning.\n\nWeather\n\nRecent Posts\n\nPosted - April 20, 2017 Capital Guardian Trust Co. raised its position in shares of American Express Company by 23.6% in the fourth quarter.

Known as myPackage, the program is designed to attract visitors to Austria by offering 11 packages to showcase Austria's most popular destinations and experiences.\n\nThe packages are diversified and target Culture, Gastronomy, Romantic Getaways and Skiing. For example, one of the Culture-based packages focuses on the 'Sound Of Music'. Included in that package is a one way airline ticket from Vienna to Salzburg, a return train ticket from Salzburg to Vienna, 3 nights in a 4-star hotel and a Sound of Music tour that will take you to the locations used in making the movie.\n\nJust a tiny glimpse of Salzburg from Mirabell Gardens, one of the locations where 'Sound Of Music' was filmed.\n\nAs an aside, I had a chance to visit Salzburg on a quick day trip from Munich last year, and can't recommend Salzburg enough! One of my favorite places that I've visited in Austria (or Europe at large for that matter).\n\nFor skiers, myPackage offers 3 Skiing themed getaways with one package specifically focused for a 'Skiing' family. For Romantics, packages are available for fantastic hotels and romantic dinners in some of Vienna's most historic locales. For lovers of Opera, there are dedicated packages designed to maximize experiences at the Vienna Konzerthaus.\n\nThese kind of packages are usually best suited for someone visiting the region for the first time and just wants to see the highlights of the area or for those who are looking for a turn-key solution where they don't have to worry about booking all the different components of a trip. It truly becomes a one-stop 'Holiday' booking service.\n\nThe packages are bundled by AUSTRIAN's travel agent partners and can easily be integrated into existing bookings and itineraries issued through Austrian Airlines.

I have worked hard this year in leadership positions in both JSA and MUN. As a part of JSA, I played a key part in organizing OES's first chapter conference and ran for OR Vice Mayor in JSA. In MUN, I was voted by my committee to be the best defendant of my country's policies as China. I believe that I have the leadership experience required to represent our student body.\n\nBut enough about me, let us talk about what I would like to do. I would like to institute wide and meaningful reforms to community time.

I do recall that one of them (not MY guy) was cute and quite funny. I just got stuck with his weirdo sidekick who knew that the distance between my house and my friend's was 3.3 miles.\n\nNow, keep in mind that my *almost* boyfriend is now a farmer. Like with his own land and own tractors and animals and things. I fully respect farmers, and I'm not knocking that career in the slightest. That was his dream when I knew him…and now he has it. He also now has 4 kids and a wife with bottle-blond hair who wears miniskirts, florescent yellow tops and stiletto fuchsia and leopard heels to the neighborhood grocery store with her bleach blond hair pulled up on top of her head and her bangs split in half with half curled up and back and the other half curled down over her forehead. Needless to say, he wouldn't have been happy with someone like me. Like I said, someone for everyone…\n\nPost navigation\n\nTizz, I appreciate your honest feedback.

{"text": "Here we go with my second vacation blog. I'm still in West Virginia, but I've switched from Big Bend to Oak Hill. So, yesterday was Easter and Bobby, myself, and Vikki Beth spent it at my daddy's and step mommas, along with my sister and brother-in-law. It was nice having everyone together, and we enjoyed a lovely family supper cooked mostly by my step momma, but with minor help from my sister and I. Here are some pictures from our Easter get together:\n\nOnce we had finished supper, I packed us back up into the Bronco and we headed off to Oak Hill, where we're staying with my sister and brother-in-law. They're newlyweds, and oh so cute together. They were married on 12/12/12, and this was the first time I really got to spend any \"quality time\" with my new brother-in-law. Needless to say, I totally approve. Vikki Beth instantly took to him, and every other sentence she said began with , \"Uncle Donnie…\"\n\nWe spent the rest of Easter just relaxing. Today we had a very full day. We headed off to Charleston, where we got to see the state capitol and a bunch of other landmarks pointed out to us by my brother-in-law. We started the day off by going ice skating. It was Boo's first time, but she did really good…especially if you factor in the fact that she's only three!!\n\nAfter ice skating for half an hour or so, we headed off to get a bite to eat. We stopped at a Chinese buffet with an amazing supply of delicious food, and for a really great price!! We paid less than $40 for four adults and one child- including the drinks! That's an amazing deal if you ask me!! We finished off our big day in Charleston with a trip to the mall, where we just walked around and saw what there was to see. After getting back to Oak Hill, we relaxed for a while, and then we spent a good three hours playing Kinnect Sports. Now everyone has winded down once more and is relaxing. Tomorrow is our last day in West Virginia, and on Wednesday we leave for Alabama- possibly with a short stop in Tennessee between! Hope everyone had a Happy Easter and is staying safe! Now, time for a bit of online work for myself, and another big day ahead of me tomorrow!!!", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "9c20f0fb-2522-4ca2-a90d-20b20a30a681", "url": "https://chelseafalin.com/2013/04/01/vacation-blog-2/"}

{"text": "Bell Pepper Salad Bowls\n\nI think that I might just be a little obsessed with turning vegetables into cups/bowls/plates etc…..But if I have the opportunity to make something cute, I totally will! A Bell Pepper Salad Bowl is a great way to show your friends and family what a creative hostess you can be!\n\nOn my blog, I have made Cucumber Dip Cups, Zucchini Pizza Cups and a Pineapple Plate. I have seen peppers used as dip bowls around the web before, but I really don't like to blog about things I have already seen a million times on Pinterest. But then, I got this idea of fanning out the bell pepper and using it as a cute and functional salad bowl The best part about this fanned out Bell Pepper bowl, is that you get perfect bite sized bell pepper slices to eat after you finish eating your salad! The bell pepper slices were perfect for soaking up some of the leftover salad dressing at the bottom of the bowl!\n\nBell Pepper Salad Bowls\n\n1) Obtain a Beautiful Bell Pepper and Wash it.\n\n2) Cut around the stem of the pepper and remove the stem.\n\n3) Cut around the perimeter of the pepper. Not all the way down though. Cut down just enough so that all the pepper slices fan out\n\n. 4) Wash the inside of the pepper and shake out the seeds. 4) Dry the pepper, inside and out.\n\n5) Fill with salad and enjoy!\n\nThese bell pepper salad bowls will fit a salad perfectly! If you grow peppers in your graden, this is a great way to use them up! I love sweet bell peppers. This lunch yesterday was a reminder that spring isn't so far away!\n\nThis bell pepper bowl is just cute! Lol, that's a word I never thought I'd use for a veggie, but it fits for this recipe.

He has been in practice for 30 years, specializing in laser, robotic laparoscopy, urogynecology, Metabolic plans, abdominal and vaginal cosmetic procedures and Bioidentical Hormone Replacement Therapy. His primary goal is to provide a Wellness Plan for each patient and ensure a healthy and active lifestyle. Although, men and women may struggle with gender-specific issues related to hormone imbalance. Erectile dysfunction is a common problem for middle-aged and older men while women may experience symptoms of sexual dysfunction as well. Unfortunately, a lot of people internalize the message that these problems are a natural part of getting older and there is nothing they can do about them. Dr. Mays, who specializes in anti-aging treatments and Bioidentical Hormone Replacement Therapy (BHRT), wants you to know this is not true.

{"text": "Cosmo/Casey\n\nTommy and I lost our first GRR boy, Butters (01-122 Bear) to hemangiosarcoma in August of 2012. We adopted Cosmo (12-093) in September of 2012, when he was 6 years old. We really aren't the \"Cosmo\" type and changed his name to Casey. We always called him our grief dog. He slept with us and each night and morning, he would snuggle up to one of us and put his head on our chest as if to say, \"It's ok, I'm here now\". And it was OK. He absolutely healed our hearts after losing Butters.\n\nHe had lived with a man for 5 years and definitely had an affinity for Tommy, so I took him through a basic obedience class to help him and I bond. He was just awesome there, and everyone told me what a good-looking dog he was. I thanked them and felt so proud, because not only was he gorgeous, he was just sweet. He was my rock solid, bombproof dog. The only flaw he had was that he didn't like being an only dog when we were gone. I still look at the nibble marks on my back door and smile. Jacki and Margo were nice enough to let us foster Lexus (12-050). She was just what Casey needed. He was still more bonded to us, but she provided something we couldn't, and he felt safer when we were both out of the house. Sadly, we lost Lexus to cancer in February of 2013. He welcomed every foster and gently taught them the ropes. We began fostering Ruger in December of 2012. I remember bringing Tucker (10-038) home and Tommy was out of town on business, so it was just me to do all the introductions. I put Casey and Ruger in our courtyard (it had a wrought-iron gate) and brought Tucker through the backyard gate. He took one look at Casey and Ruger and he was barking, growling and snarling. This went on for a while until Casey backed up and lay down, as if to tell Tracker \"I mean you no harm\". We had a successful meeting because Casey made it that way. He was just the best dog! He had enough energy to play ball and run around in the yard, yet he knew when we came inside, that it was time to settle down.\n\nHemangiosarcoma claimed his life in 3 days - the exact same cancer that took Butters from us, also in 3 days. I am forever grateful to Dr. Eric Winston. He told us to bring Casey in at 5pm (this was a Friday) if he wasn't better and he stayed with him until midnight. Saturday we took him to a specialty hospital where they continued diagnostics – no one knew what was wrong. Finally, the radiologist on Sunday afternoon confirmed a hemangiosarcoma diagnosis. We knew it was time and we knew we had to be good to Casey, as he had always been to us. Good friends that were close to our dogs came to the hospital and were able to love on him and say their goodbyes. I think we stayed about 3 ½ hours with him. We only had him for 3 years, but they were so fun-filled. We have so beautiful and heartwarming memories of him that we will always cherish. We will see you at The Bridge dear Casey.\n\nGold Ribbon Rescue does not and shall not discriminate on the basis of race, color, religion, gender, gender expression, age, ancestry, disability, sexual orientation or military status, in any of its activities or operations.", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "31146a66-8a24-4736-a5a4-845a3eeb5f51", "url": "http://www.grr-tx.com/dogs/cosmocasey"}

{"text": "6.10.2016\n\nHey there friends. This is a sad post to write, but I wanted to share a little of what's been going on behind the scenes the past few weeks. As much as I like to try to keep this blog about my creative pursuits and focus on the good things in life, I also feel like I can't really get back to those posts until I talk about this first.\n\nNick and I had to say goodbye to our dog, Lucille, a few weeks ago. I know many of you have shared when your pets have passed away and so I'm sure you can understand the heartache we've been feeling. Lucille was 10 years old, but her death was sudden and unexpected. She was her usual happy self when both of us came home from work, but began acting funny around 8 or 9 pm - not eating dinner, breathing heavy. She continued to decline throughout the night and by 5am she was gone. There was nothing we could do. The only bright side is that we were both there with her in the end, and though she was in pain and scared, it wasn't prolonged. And I think we both feel somewhat grateful that we didn't have to make any hard decisions about putting her down.\n\nLucille was 2 years old when I met Nick. He got her as a puppy while living in the Shenandoah Valley in Virginia. She was a mutt and the runt of the litter, and she stole his heart by constantly untying his shoes. She was no bigger than a loaf of bread. When I met Lucille for the first time I remember thinking \"wow, that is a good dog.\" I've always loved dogs, but Lucille was the first dog I ever met who was truly a good dog. She was amazingly sweet tempered with everyone and everything - even when we brought our shitty cat, Mister Muscles, into the house (Muscles looooved Lucille, by the way). She was also incredibly smart and well behaved. She was just easy. And she had nothing to give but love. I always joked that Lucille resented me showing up in Nick's life - that she was Nick's #1 girl, but that couldn't have been further from the truth. She was my #1 girl, too.\n\nI've never thought of myself as the type of person who considers my pets \"my children\" or \"my furbabies\". But Lucille was my family. It's amazing how much she was a part of the fabric of our lives - in ways I've never thought about until she's gone. I miss the sound of her nails click clicking on the hardwood floors. I miss her heavy sighs, and her snores. I miss the weight of her head in my lap and the constant presence of her at my feet. I miss her velvety ears and soulful eyes. I miss having an excuse to go for walks. I miss that there is no fanfare - no one visibly excited - when I open the drawer to get the 'poo bags'. I miss her toys and her food bowl and I even miss her shedding. Thunderstorms take me by surprise (Lucille hated thunderstorms and would begin panting and shaking well before we were aware that it was even going to rain). I still pause every time I open the front door, thinking she's about to run out to me.\n\nI feel a bit like a crazy person that my feelings of grief and loss are so shockingly profound, but I know those of you that have loved and lost an amazing animal will understand. I wish there was more decorum allowed for the loss of a pet. Lucille deserves better than a blog post, but sadly, that's all I have to give.\n\nThank you for letting me share my little heartache with you all. I'm hoping that in sharing this sadness I can get back to posting about what I love and what makes me happy without feeling like a fraud.

Are you?\n\nWhat's This TV Show About?\n\nAiring on the CBS television network, SEAL Team stars David Boreanaz, Max Thieriot, Neil Brown Jr., AJ Buckley, Toni Trucks, Jessica Paré, and Judd Lormand. The military action drama series centers on an exclusive Navy SEAL unit as they train for, plan, and risk their very lives to carry out perilous missions for the sake and honor of the U.S.A. Fierce and focused Jason Hayes (Boreanaz) leads the Tier One team. Despite the hardship it causes them and their families, this SEAL team is ready, willing, and able to embark upon secret missions at the drop of a hat. Their love of country and deep resolve is unmatched.\n\nTelly's Take\n\nAlthough it premiered with positive ratings, it is still too early to use those numbers to predict whether CBS will cancel or renew SEAL Team for season two.

{"text": "\n\nSunday, August 2, 2009\n\nIn our duplex bedroom apartment, we have two computers on the upper level (our offices), a desktop on our kitchen table, and two laptops that make the rounds. It's hard to spend time on the second floor, because that either takes us our of Bradley earshot or brings him upstairs where he demands we play with him instead of working on our computer. Downstairs we at least have a shot at keeping him amused for stretches of time (20-30 minutes) while we work. Of course if only one of us is home, the situation becomes even less manageable.\n\nI used to try and sit on the floor with him, \"playing,\" while sneaking minutes to type or read. Aside from the detrimental (to him and me) distraction, the challenge to get mental focus from zero to sixty in three seconds was enormous. Even with half-hour stretches of work, this is a huge problem.\n\nA couple of months ago, I gave up trying to divide attention, and now save writing for the downstairs desktop, at times my wife takes Bradley out; for an hour or two at the upstairs desktop after Bradley goes down and before the customary midnight bedtime (which leaves barely enough hours to sleep before he wakes up between 7:30 and 8); and for the laptop when I am out of town or away at our summer property by myself, or, if I'm there with Denise and Bradley, for nighttime, when he's asleep and Denise also has work to do. (On the property we stay in a camper that has one small table, on which we set our two laptops back to back. Sometimes, one or both of us can sit on the deck and write, but with Bradley loose on two acres, this isn't a great option.)\n\nSo, where and how do you work and watch you kids at the same time? Do you? How have you arranged your living space to combine or separate work and child-rearing?\n\nThursday, July 23, 2009\n\nMy son Bradley, two and a half, a thirty-three-inch-high, acrobatic, high-energy, bundle of sheer will, is back in Florida, whence he came to us in October 2008. My wife and I are parents in our forties, both professors and writers. I have been publishing for over twenty years, and had just begun to achieve some success when Bradley arrived. In other words, I hit that crucial point in the career when writers grow or slowly disappear.\n\nI'm here in Florida with Bradley, giving my wife time to do research on the Italian Americans of Tampa, her current subject. This little vacation follows a ten-day solo stint on my little place in Upstate New York, during which I was able to keep my own schedule and write as much as I pleased. In that short time, I finished more work than I had in the previous nine months, including a short story owed an editor, the first chapter of a cookbook, and the last portion of a story that will round out a small collection of \"Pope Stories.\" That's the reality.\n\nI'm going to blog for a little while on putting writing out of my mind for a while, the adjustment to that, and strategies for getting back to it on Bradley's schedule, not mine.", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "b11b8eb9-9859-4a71-ae42-ca0bd8055ef5", "url": "http://writerhole.blogspot.com/2009/"}

{"text": "A Review Of Sorts: Roses and Rot\n\nBy: Michael Worthan\n\nI am terrible at reviews, not because I lack the vernacular to write about something, see that there that's at least a two dollar word, it's because I feel I never do justice to what I have read. I have a terrible habit of reading others reviews and seeing that they break down every page, every twist, every turn, and even delve into what things could or should mean. I'm not that guy, again I am intelligent and thorough enough to do that, but when I read something I want to make my own conclusions, draw forth my own thoughts.\n\nSo I always come to a compromise, I will tell you what the book is about in the vaguest of senses, like you might as well read the back of the book to get a feel for it kind of vague, and then I will tell you what I thought of the book without giving even the slightest possible thing away. I do this with all my reviews or books and even movies, I want the reader to read the book, but also to connect their own dots, like a great song an amazing book means something different to everyone.\n\nWhen Imogen was young she told her sister Marin fairy tales. Once upon a time, she'd tell her, there was a way out, out of their awful lives, away from their abusive mother, this way was on the backs of fairies. As an adult Imogen realizes that the true escape had been in telling those tales and so she continues to tell them as a writer who is still grappling with the nightmare that was her childhood. Reunited with her sister at an artists' retreat Imogen is forced to confront her past.\n\nThe debut novel of author Kat Howard (I linked you folks to the Amazon pages, spoiler the book is great go buy it) is nothing short of amazing. A fan of all sorts of Fiction Roses and Rot had me enthralled in the story the entire time. I was no longer just an audience member reading a book to what will definitely become a best seller, I was a part of the story, a witness to something beautiful yet horrifying in the same way.\n\nHoward's Attention to detail, ability to surprise me as a reader, and use of the Grimm styled fairies that I have come to love and fear in the world of Fantasy had me smiling and grimacing all the same. Like I said before I refuse to spoil this book, but I can definitely assure you that this is one that I will share with all of my readers, friends, and family. Kat Howard deserves nothing less than a standing ovation for this novel, and I personally can not wait to see what she does in the future.", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "152818e1-e033-49dc-9fc1-db97c9062986", "url": "https://iknownerd.wordpress.com/2016/06/29/a-review-of-sorts-roses-and-rot/comment-page-1/"}

{"text": "Sunday, November 29, 2009\n\nI'm guessing that if you are reading this, then you survived BLACK FRIDAY! And Now it's CYBER MONDAY!\n\nAfter standing in lines from early in the morning and then only to find that the store probably only had 13 of the items you had your heart set on, I have to symphasize with you. Fortunately I was not one of those. I have to admit I was up early to go to work, but made sure to hit the Starbucks furthest from the malls.\n\nIn passing Walmart and I noticed that not only was their parking lot full, but they filled the Home Depot parking lot next door and just about any parking spot they could find. After work, I did wander into Walmart at the end of the day to see what was left, or more correctly what was not left and saw the rows of truck containers lined up on the road in the back waiting to either restock Walmart or unload the newly arrived Christmas trees.\n\nSo just to brighten your day and if you have a chance to get in on some CYBER MONDAY online shopping, which may take some online work to match those of BLACK FRIDAY'S. I have put together a package, limited as it is, to help you in your marketing and money making through the year and enjoy some Hawaiian Christmas Music through the season. This little incentive package combines the HOT Selling SPIDER SEO program with a little bonus.\n\nFor the first Fifty that purchase the SPIDER SEO package through the following link, I am going to give your absolutely free a copy of \"Have a Very Maui Christmas.\" This CD was made back in 2002 and in a limited quantity. My brother's a recording studio engineer and he brought in some little know and since pretty well know Hawaiian Musician's that recorded a Christmas CD. As I was cleaning out my closets, I found a case of them and so for a limited time, unless I can scrape up a few more before Christmas, I will be including a copy to everyone that purchases the SPIDER SEO. I know that this is a CYBER MONDAY promotion, but I just may extend it until Tuesday for those that still have to work, but don't wait or your chance will be gone!\n\nThis year make a point to create yourself a Self Sustatainingincome and enjoy the time listening to some Hawaiian Music and thinking about taking that vacation on Maui.\n\nWhile you can buy the SPIDER SEO through any of my links on this page, please use this one to help me better track your purchase and get that gift off to you right away.\n\nUlupalakua Ranch's owners Pardee and his son Sumner have taken nearly 12,000 acres of their existing 18,000 acre ranch lands and donated them through an easement to the Maui Coastal Land Trust.\n\nThe land that the Erdmans of Ulupalakua Ranch have now preserved for future generation are very much a visible part of Maui.\n\nPart of the land was an Awapuahi. In the older days of Hawaii as land was considered \"divided\", it normally consisted of parcels that ran from the ocean to the mountain, sort of pie slice shape. This allowed the people that lived on that land to make full use of all it's various resources.\nThey could live along the beaches or in the mountain areas or choose to move to one or the other throughout the year.\nFishing, medicines from plants and various types of crops, not to mention just fresh drinking water were available for everyone's use. A concept that modern land ownership took away.\n\nMuch of the property donated in an historic lease agreement allow for the Ulupalakua Ranch to still use the property for much of their normal ranching, which presently consists of about 5000 cows, but also includes goats, Elks, Lambs. In addition they grow grapes and operate a Winery, small store and leases to operations like horseback riding and clay shooting.\n\nThe parcel includes the very sensitive Auwahi Habitat Restoration Project area that has been successfully removing invasive plants and replacing them with native species.\n\nWith so much development encroaching on the lands around Ulupalakua, including Oprah Winfrey purchasing a 1,000 acre parcel next door, the Erdmans felt it was time to make a move like this.\n\nIn the past, the site of Ulupalakua Ranch has a very rich history. Founded as far back as 1865 by Linton Torbet. The ranch had various owners over the years, with Captain James Makee probably one of the most notable.\n\nThe Ranch was a favorite stopping off and vacation spot by many famous people in it's early years. Hawaii kings and many notable Authors were among it's large and varied list of guests.\n\nHere we are 150 years later and the land that once was the home to many forests and plants like the very much valued Sandal wood trees that were all either harvested or removed to make room for pasture land, will now see from 12 to 15 Wind Turbines sprout along the ridge line\nAdding nearly 20 Million Watts of power to Maui's Electrical grid. Sempra Energy recently of San Diego recently bought the project and acquired the lease within the Auwahi portion of the Ranch.\n\nSo with the exception of possibly viewing a few Wind Turbines, the southern ridge of Haleakala on Maui in Hawaii will continue to hold it's present beauty and view.\n\nOf course, adjacent land owner's are not restricted beyond the normal existing laws and development will no doubt continue on around the Ranch, but maybe the government and public will take the Erdman's act into consideration when considering future proposals for development, at least within that area of Maui.\n\nHaving been privileged in the past, during a time when I worked on the two-way radios for the ranch and took many a trip to the top of this region, stopping off to taste some freshly picked Strawberries at the newly started Ulupalakua grown Strawberry farm, being raised on Maui it was my first time to taste what an actual plant ripened Strawberry, as opposed to the green ones picked on the mainland and forced ripened for sale in our stores. I never imagined a Strawberry being eaten without sugar sprinkled on them. The experience and the views from the top of the ranch where their water tank and radio repeater were breath taking. I just wish they had digitable cameras back then.\n\nI hope to see more of this take place, especially after having just been working above the pineapple fields located on the slopes of the West Maui Mountains above the resorts and development.\n\nWith the new of Maui Land and Pine apple closing all it's Pineapple operation this is a huge area that could quite easily be either developed or mismanaged and through erosion devastate the slopes and further add to the loss of our ocean's reefs.\n\nThrough proper cover cropping and similiar trusts or leases, these lands could also be held for the future.\n\nSaturday, November 28, 2009\n\nThe last thing I would want my blogs and websites to be viewed as is just another web marketing site, but part of being self sufficient and sustainable is knowing how to not only make money, but to reduce your debts.\nOne program that is useful in educating and helping you to get your website noticed by search engines like google is  it is useful in understanding more about how the \"spiders\" or \"internet robots\" go out and find your site.\nBasically, these spiders and robots read the content or wording on your site and the links that are included in your posts and keep a record of it all.\nThen when someone searches for something related, they know which sites to take the searcher to.\nThe ability to second guess how search engines rate the importance or relevance of your site to what is being searched for is sort of like playing the stock market, although getting your website or blog as close to the top of the list, especially when the search engines may return literally tens of thousands of websites, can really make a difference in whether your wasting your time online or not.\n\nSo once again  a program called Spider Seo can really help you to understand how to get as near to the top of the search list as possible.\n\nI may have to start a blog related to just the internet side of business. No matter what type of business your in these days, the internet is bound to play a part of it. That is if you want it to be seen and read.\n\nWhy would anyone want to put themselves through all that when for today only, you could order the instructions on how to make Solar or Wind Turbines not only for a fraction of the cost and for today Black Friday get it for about the price you would pay for a few Starbucks coffees.\n\nThursday, November 26, 2009\n\nUnless you are the type that enjoys those 4am mornings at the Mall to scrimp and save over a few dollars what ever might be left in the stores by the time you actually get in there, here is a way to save some money until Friday Night only and then keep saving money throughout the entire year.\n\nThese savings are only happening until the end of Friday, and you won't see it again until next year. So if you want to learn how to build solar panels and wind generators get your guides at a very reduced cost.\n\nTuesday, November 24, 2009\n\nOver the weekend Maui Electric Company, the local electric provider for Maui Hawaii installed a Mariah Vertical Wind Turbine. actual a local company installed it and will turn it over to Maui Electric. There are two charging stations located in front that can be accessed for Electric Cars to use. Whether it will be just for the Maui Electric Vehicles for now or not, I am not sure.\n\nThe video was captured early in the morning before starting work and so most of the noise is due to traffic. the Wind Turbine is very quiet.\n\nMonday morning upon arriving early to work, I found that all the equipment I thought was being unloaded to put up a gate on Friday, turned out to be for something else entirely.\n\nAs it turns out Maui Electric had a Vertical Wind Turbine with two vehicle chargers installed rigt in the front of their Main Office Building in Kahului on Maui.\n\nIt was still early and the sun was just rising. so the pictures are a bit light, but the wind was blowing and I heard it ran pretty fast over the weekend. I will still need to get more info on it, but it looks to be a Mariah WindSpire 1.2 Vertical Wind Turbine.\n\nIt ran quietly in the early morning breeze. I hope to have more video up on it later. For now, her is a picture or two.\n\nSunday, November 22, 2009\n\nGoogle uses what are called \"Spiders\" to crawl around the internet and look at every page. That's how come they can find so many things people are interested in, but unless you understand more about how they work (Google's pretty good at keeping their ways a secret), you may want to understand more about how their \"Spiders\" work. This program will help you to do that.\n\nThere are many ways to put some of you computer and internet skills to work to create additional income and even re-occuring income. I have some of the ads posted on this page for a few programs that would allow you to do just that.\n\nEven if you are still employed, you can put some time in during the week instead of watching TV or surfing around the internet. Using some of these programs could be the answer to helping make ends meet.\n\nWhy sit around wondering how to get the extra money to pay the bills or mortgage, when educating yourself and joining a few different programs can help solve that problem.\n\nOne of my main goals with  is Sustainability. Having enough money is a crucial aspect to being self sufficient and part of living a Sustainable life.\n\nThe website  is being structured around a Sustainable Life for people. So beyond helping to reduce, conserve and produce Energy, as well as, learning more about how to Farm and produce Food. Increasing your income is a large part of the Sustainable aspect of life.\n\nSo signing up for the EmpowerMaui newsletter using the Big Blue Button located at the top right of this blog and the top left of my website at  can help you to achieve a truly SustainableLifestyle and help take the pressure off. Go and sign up right now for the newsletter today and look at the various programs and choose ones that can help you achieve that extra income.\n\nI will be adding more under the topic of Education to point you in the direction of how to make the Internet work for you. Most of the programs are very thorough and give you access to a wealth of information and help on how to market their products. Many, if not most of the Affiliate Programs actually do the majority of the work and you just collect your commissions.\n\nWouldn't you rather be checking your bank account deposits grow, rather than blowing the time on another reality TV show?Tuesday, November 17, 2009\n\nAfter emailing Teresa Martin-Pike of Pike Family Farm and letting her know she was the one to get the copy of the \"Great Energy Book Give Away\" her response started off with \"Aloha!Yipee, And yes, we do use a lot of energy on the farm, I'm very excited to learn more!!\" She no doubt was happy to learn she had been selected to get the copy.\n\nLiving on a farm, she has quite a need for Energy in many ways. I hope this will help her to produce some extra Energy and help her to also lower her cost she already paying. Take a look at her website at  and see how beautiful it looks and the amazing things she and her family have done with it.\n\nFor the rest of you that were not able to get a copy. the name of the site is Earth4Energy and can be accessed by clicking on the name or here!\n\nEarth4Energy will teach even the most people with no clue how to build Solar and Wind Energy at a fraction of what it costs to buy it outright. They also includes plans, step by step instructions and even video of every step of the way.\n\nIf places like Germany can lead the way in Solar use, I don't see why America can't have solar somewhere on every piece of property. With prices so low and where to buy the products to assemble units in your garage or yard. there no reason not to get a copy and try a project.\n\nHey!, maybe it could become a nice little business producing panels for all your neighbors. You won't know until you give it a try.\n\nMonday, November 16, 2009\n\nAs some of you may already know, and especially those that follow EmpowerMaui on Twitter do know, I have been itching to give away a copy of a great DVD for building your own Solar and Wind energy.\n\nIt's been called the \"Great Energy Book Give Away\" and even though it's not actually a book, it's jam packed with useful information and plans. There are video tutorials and even where to get the parts to build the equipment.\n\nAs it turns out, one of my Twitter followers that signed up has been selected and I will be arranging to ship her a copy at no cost to her. What a deal! Most give-aways make you pay the shipping.\n\nThe winner is Teresa Martin-Pike of Pike Valley Farms in Kentucky. Their farm can be found on Facebook and here is a direct quote from their bio section \"Pike Valley Farm is a Certified Organic, pastured and sustainable farm in the north end of Garrard County. You can call ahead and buy directly from the farm if you'd like! Think of us as your local farmer!\"\n\nSo Congratulations Teresa and I'm so happy for you that you will be able to attend the Weston Price Foundation Conference this year. I attended the AcresUSA Conference last year and it was definitely worth the time and expense to get there from Hawaii.\n\nWell I'm sure you use quite a bit of Energy on the Farm and I hope this helps. Now I wish you were one of the people I hope to give away to that is that is more directly related to Farming, but that's another give away.\n\nTeresa is one of my followers on Twitter and goes under the Twitter name of pikevalleyfarm. Be sure to visit her and follow them on Twitter, Facebook and their website \n\nSaturday, November 14, 2009\n\nI just watched the movie called Pirate Radio about a radio station and a quite unusual mix of characters that managed to bring Rock & Roll to Great Britain during a time when it was outlawed.\n\nTo me this represents the Sustainability of Music and the effect it has on people and Community.\n\nThe fact that it can create such a diversity of opinions and yet bring even the most unexpected people together really shows how Sustainable some things are.\n\nOvertime they may change to suite the times, but often the message is carried on.\n\nWhile not a real movie critic, it sure beat all the violent type movies that there were to choose from and I would recommend it, if for no other reason than just to be entertained and realize a true sense of what can happen when a common goal is the purpose of many.\n\nWith most of my chores done and some running of errands out of the way, I can't help but wish it would rain.\nThe weather guessers keep calling for like 80% rain and except for some mercy of high clouds, it's still awfully muggy and hot downtown in central Maui.\nShould be on top of more work but find it hard to get motivated in this heat.\nIt's a shame to live on an island surrounded by beaches when you would rather live in the mountains.\nBeing raised here and seeing, as well as doing most things doesn't help.\nDon't for get that my great Energy Book (CD) Give Away ends tomorrow and then someone will get a brand new unwrapped copy of it at no charge. I'll even send it out at my cost!\nNot many offers like that. In fact, I don't think I've ever seen one where they didn't make you at least pay the postage. This is the link  sign in now!\n\nThursday, November 12, 2009\n\nWhile I do use my Website to try and categorize the use of Sustainable Technology in the aeas of Energy, Food, Farming, Water, Education and Community Events, I am finding that the blog works about the best in getting the word out. My websites  and my  site try to bring a little of Maui to those that care to see it. Often I have received notes from family members of people that now live on Maui and are appreciative to see what is going on here. While I am obviously not to only source for this, it is from my point of view. I just wish I had more time and skills to bring it out better and quicker. what for more articles relating to Crowdsourcing. this may be the answer for many to help together in this sort of area.\n\nI am constantly searching and researching Technologies. Being in the Energy Sector, I tend to find it the most relevant, since I know the most about it. Probably the second most relevant area is my interest in Growing and Educating around good Farming practices. That is why I am also sitting as the VP on Maui Aloha Aina Association, a 501c3 Non Profit Organization, and can be found at  has a conferences coming up On January 16th & 17, 2010 in Olinda, Maui on a Farm. This is around the 10th year since this Conference has started and brings in world class speakers from the likes of  and \n\nProbably one area I am most passionate, but have the least time to devote to is Education. Within the next few years many people, myself included that have been working in the field of Energy will be hitting retirement age. This is a scary thought from having seen the changes over the last 16 years and the changes that are coming with the Smart Grid.\n\nMy concern is, where will the people come from that will do this work. Many of the Colleges are turning out people that are more interested in the glamorous work and not really geared towards Utility work. Granted the Utility as we know it today, may not be the same one as we see in even the next few years.\n\nThe Technology of the Smart Grid, Automated Buildings and Meters, Alternate Sources of Energy such as Solar, Wind, Bio-Fuels, Algae, Bio-Mass, Fuel Cells, Concentrating Solar (CSP) which National Geographic did a great article on recently, and even the release this past Sunday in the Maui News for a contractors to lay down Electric Lines that will be used to interconnect the Hawaiian Islands of Maui, Lanai, Molokai and Oahu. Changes in the way we Store and Reuse Electricity through times when it cannot be generated and of course the existing technologies of Natural Gas, Coal, Oil and Nuclear. Europe just announced, I believe it was France, that they will move towards more NuclearTechnology. There are so many ways in which Energy will be provided and how it is used and distributed is probably the bigger question.\n\nTransportation has gone towards ElectricAutomobiles, surely not an old Technology, but there are firms that can right now build Semi-Tractor Trucks with at least, if not more pulling power than the conventional diesel trucks. Their range is getting better all the time.\n\nPersonally, I have been experimenting with products for Battery Technology. This is in regard to the re-use of what was considered to be dead and useless Lead Acid and Gel Cell Batteries that would ultimately be disposed of, if they are indeed disposed of right and end up as hazardous materials and sent to be recycled properly. More often than not, at least on Maui, I find them laying on the side of the road since know one wants to pay the cost to get rid of them.\n\nOne particular product that doesn't require opening the battery, has even in it's simplest version, been allowing me to rejuvenate to date about 10Yuasa Gel Cell Batteries. Five of them are probably 15 years old, wouldn't accept a charge anymore and sat around with only a 5-6 Volt DC charge when they should have been at least at 12 Volts DC. I've also been successful at bringing back some smaller units from some small UPS (Uninterruptable Power supples).\n\nWhile I'm wandering a bit in this post, the point is that Sustainable Technology is something that is needed, Education is very much needed and programs to place the workers into the right fields so we can produce much needed products and employ the citizens of our Country the United States. Much of what we should have shifted towards has moved off shore and left towns and workforces idled. It's effected our economy and created a record unemployment of over 10% and growing in many areas. This does not need to be the case.\n\nThey are a number of Organizations that can be re-tooled and put these people to work, the resourses are still there to help train and re-train people to produce these goods. The ability to turn our lands back into Nutrient Dense and Useful Lands that can become our Farmacys and help move us away from depending on what has come to become the Medical System and the dependency on new and expensive drugs to try and \"band aid\" the symptoms of just not eating right. It's never too late and the both the HumanBody and the Earth are pretty amazing at responding to the right inputs in healing themselves.\n\nThat brings me to the internet. while I would love to fill all my blogs and websites with advertisements for Local Companies, it's a quite a task to approach and help create ads and spaces for them all. I hope to do that with my  website. In the meantime I will try to include ads to Companies that not only have something valuable to bring to the Sustainable Table, but can also help provide some revenue for me to keep spreading the information.\n\nWe haven't had much rain lately, especially in Central Maui, but I better end now because the lightning and rain are getting pretty intense. Time to disconnect from the grid in the event of a surge.\n\nTake care and if you wish to follow me in short burst and are into Twitter, I can be found under the name of EmpowerMaui on Twitter and my site page is \n\nHave a wonderful day or night, where ever you happen to be and I am going to go enjoy the sound of the rain and have some late dinner.\n\nWednesday, November 11, 2009\n\nI have found a product that gives a person all the details that help them to not only build their own Solar Panels, Wind Turbines and a host of other products. It also includes where to obtain the supplies to build a panel for under $200.00. I plan to give away a copy on November 15, 2009.\n\nI have one copy to give out and the hitch is that you must get signed in at  before the 15th in order to have a chance at receiving the copy. All that is required is your name and email address to initially be entered.\n\nAfter signing in look for a spot at the top with a Url that will allow you to download a Pdf file on over 400 tips for Self Improvement at no cost and yours to keep. This Pdf is over 90 pages long and available to keep by anyone that registers.\n\nOnce registered, if you are selected, I will email you for more details on how to get the CD to you. So don't wait go to  and register right away. This CD will be sent out at no cost to whomever is the lucky person that is chosen. After that everyone else will just have to buy a copy for themselves if they want this valuable information.\n\nLook forward to more of these types of give aways in the future, but with a different theme based around Sustainability.\n\nWednesday, November 4, 2009\n\nAloha,\n\nI've been so busy with my \"real\" job, working on websites and evaluating energy products, not to mention the successful trip to four Organic Sustainable Farms in Kipahulu Maui with about 100 people in attendance that it's been hard to find time to even get a blog in. I seem to have problems making my new Blackberry on Verizon post to the blog, but I will get it down one day.\n\nIn the meantime I've posted some of my video of the various groups playing at the Annual Maui Ukulele Festival 2009 held at the Maui Arts and Cultural Center.\n\nThe event is a complete day of Hawaii musicians and because of local and individual sponsorship, it is free to the public each year. You can find it at EmpowerMaui.com and besides one of my favorite groups the Hula Honeys being right on the front page, look under the community events heading in the main menu or recent articles and you can watch some more like Hula Lindsey and some of the winners of this years Merry Monarch Hula Festival held in Hilo.\n\nAlso Herb Ohta Sr. has a page and he is one of the originals that even played on the old Ed Sullivan show years ago.\n\nDon't forget that if you are a Twitter follower of EmpowerMaui you only have a fee more days to register for the \"Great Energy Book (CD) Give Away\" at  and I've sweetened it up a bit by adding a download on the page immediately following your registration. The download has over 400 tips on Self Improvement and is over 90 pages long in Pdf format. Either way you get something out of signing up.\n\nI also have a poll on the front page, left-side about Twitter. I know some love it, some don't and many don't even know how to use it.

{"text": "Posts\n\nOne of the benefits of modern technology is that when you are out for lunch with a fellow priest, it is possible to have a quick look at the days \"Bolletino\" from the Vatican. Very often there is not much to write home about but on Saturday, I was surprised to see the announcement that Bishop Josef Wróbel of Helsinki was appointed as one of the assistant Bishops of the Diocese of Lublin.\n\nThe Finnish news service YLE news describes it as an \"abrupt departure\" and a \"surprise move\". This could just be journalese - most episcopal appointments are a bit of a surprise and happen abruptly. Nevertheless, I did find it intriguing that an Ordinary should be taking up post as an auxiliary Bishop - perhaps there is some special need in Lublin or perhaps Bishop Wrobel wishes to return to his alma mater.\n\nMy friends in Helsinki will no doubt be wondering who their new Bishop is going to be.\n\nArchbishop Kelly of Liverpool has appointed Fr Simon Henry to the Church of St Vincent in Liverpool's Toxteth. St Vincent's is an 1856 Pugin Church that has not been wreckovated. It has only 25-30 people attending Mass there each week. There is a Sunday afternoon Mass in Liverpool served by a rota of priests and attended by 40-50 people in a less accessible location. I wish Fr Henry every success in this new initiative which will put the traditional liturgy into the mainstream of the life of the diocese: a \"treasure for the whole Church\" as Cardinal Hoyos has said.\n\nNot having a television, I get my news about the great service that our broadcasters are offering us from pro-life websites. Thus I find that Heinz has dropped a TV advert for its mayo because 200 people have complained about a gay kiss in the advert. (Cf. LifeSite news article)\n\nThe Pink Paper has picked up the story (Warning: this is a site that has stories such as '\"Eco-dildo\" a useful bulwark against oil price instability.') It refers to the key article by Ben Summerskill of Stonewall in the Guardian: Beanz meanz bigotz calling for a boycott of all Heinz products.\n\nI thought that this story might be a gift for headline writers. Such is the nervousness over the whole issue, however, that the headlines are all very prim and proper. Lifesite's \"Heinz in Pickle\" and the Grauniad's \"Heinz mayo ad too saucy\" are about as far as people are prepared to go. Let's see if the bloggers can do better!\n\nArchbishop Raymond Burke has been appointed as prefect of the Supreme Tribunal of the Apostolic Signatura. His departure will be a great loss for the Diocese of St Louis but a great gain for the Vatican.\n\nArchbishop Burke, who is 60 on Monday, was Bishop of La Crosse from 1995 until he was named as Archbishop of St Louis in 2003 to replace Archbishop Rigali. He has established oratories for those who attend the Traditional Latin Mass and has invited the Institute of Christ the King into his diocese. Last year, he ordained two of their priests in the traditional rite in the Cathedral Basilica of St Louis.\n\nDuring the run-up to the 2004 presidential election, he publicly stated that pro-abortion politicians should not receive Holy Communion (obviously intending to include John Kerry).\n\nWhen questioned during another controversy about his firm and uncompromising defence the sanctity of life, he said:\"Is there something unusual about a bishop saying that it's wrong to be in favor of procur…\n\nI have just received a review copy of \"Reclaiming our Priestly Character\" by Fr David Toups. The book includes a historico-theological examination of the doctrine of Priestly Character, an analysis of post-conciliar confusion over the priesthood, and a positive presentation of six key principles in the foundation of priestly life\n\nFr Toups is a priest of the diocese of St Petersburg, Florida, ordained in 1997 and currently working with the US Conference of Catholic Bishops as the Associate Director of the Secretariat for Clergy, Consecrated Life and Vocations.\n\n\"Reclaiming Priestly Character\" is based on his Doctoral thesis, completed in 2004 at the Angelicum in Rome. The footnotes are wisely left in the text, thus offering a source of further reading and, as Fr Toups says, \"as a reminder that this work is not simply my own opinion or perspective.\"\n\nThis is an excellent book which I would recommend especially to priests and seminarians but also to laity who wou…\n\nMgr Marini, the Master of Pontifical Ceremonies has given an interview to L'Osservatore Romano in which he has said that it will be a habitual practice at papal Masses for Holy Communion to be given on the tongue to the faithful kneeling down.\n\nIn the same post, Fr Z has included the podcast of the sermon he preached here at Blackfen on the Feast of the Exaltation of the Holy Cross at a High Mass on the occasion of the promulgation of the Motu Proprio Summorum Pontificum.\n\nThe Lancaster Cathedral blog reports on the music at their monthly EF Mass celebrated last Saturday:Il Suono, the a cappella group who sang a concert in the Cathedral last night, also sang at today's Mass. They sang the Mass of Pange Lingua by Josquin Desprez (1450-1521) and motets by Byrd. It is wonderful to hear this sacred music being performed in the context for which it was written.\n\nThere is a rumour about that Cardinal Antonio Cañizares Llovera, Archbishop of Toledo and Primate of Spain is to succeed Cardinal Arinze as Prefect of the the Congregation for Divine Worship. (Cf. NLM: \"The Little Ratzinger\" to head CDW?)\n\nFor pictures of the Cardinal such as that above, you could look at the ICKSP site where there are photos of an ordination that he carried out.\n\nClaire and Stuart McCullogh today gave an inspiring talk to clergy gathered for the conference of the Association of Priests for the Gospel of Life. Taking it in turns, they spoke about the origin of their work, their way of counselling women who have decided that they must have an abortion, about the reasons women want to have an abortion, and about what priests ought to be doing.\n\nIt was very helpful to hear from two people who are on the \"front line\" of pro-life work about what is actually going on when women seek abortion. They report that nearly all of their clients know that they are carrying a human life and that abortion will kill that life. They believe that abortion is wrong. Then there is the big \"BUT\". For various reasons, women feel that they simply cannot continue with this pregnancy now and that they must therefore, regrettably, go through with the abortion. The mission of the Good Counsel is to \"mediate the mission of motherhood\", to revive …\n\nThe Catholic Children's Society has published a statement indicating its intention to comply with the Equality Act 2006 and the Sexual Orientation Regulations. This involves accepting the requirement not to \"discriminate\" against same-sex couples when considering couples as adoptive parents.\n\nBut then there is the question of the money that the society holds which has been donated by the Catholic faithful in good faith, believing that they were donating money to a charity that would act in accordance with the beliefs and practices of the Roman Catholic Church. Should this money be transferred to the new non-Catholic charit…\n\nOK, first of all the acronyms. CMF - the Christian Medical Fellowship which is doing sterling work in supporting the family and promoting the sanctity of human life. BMA - the British Medical Association, the UK based professional association for doctors. ARM - the Annual Representative Meeting of the BMA, its key policy-making meeting. This year's meeting will be from 7-10 July.\n\nThis motion, to be considered on the Thursday morning (10 July), proposes a serious restriction upon pro-life doctors who conscientiously object to abortion. Harris wishes them to be forbidden to claim that they give \"balanced advice\" and to be forced to refer patients to doctors who will carry out abortions.\n\nThe first clause of the Abortion Act begins: 1. — (1) Subject to the provisions of this section, a person shall not be guilty of an offence under the law relating to abortion when a pregnancy is terminated by a registered medical practitioner if [...]This recognises that abortion is still an offence in the UK and can only be carried out legally if certain conditions are met. These are described in the current Abortion Act continues as follows:[...] two registered medical practitioners are of the opinion, formed in good faith—\n\n(a) thatIn the meantime, in my parish I celebrated Mass this evening for the children and young people of our parish who have died. We have had a number of tragic deaths and the parents never cease to amaze me with their fortitude and charity. Here is my sermon for this evening's Mass in which I tried to say something of use, God help me! I post it here in case it may be of help to any of you.Lawrence Binyon's poem for the fallen expressed the sorrow of a whole generation of mothers and fathers who sons died in the fields of Flanders, the Somme and other battlefields of the first World War. It struck me that his words probably reflect our feelings too as we remember the children and young people of our parish who have died. Of them too, it is true that:\n\nThey shall not grow old, as we that are left grow old: Age shall not weary them, nor the years condemn. At the going down of the sun and in the morning We will remember them.\n\nWestminster Diocese is awash with rumblings about a talk given last Wednesday at the All Saints Pastoral Centre, London Colney to over 200 priests by Fr Jerome Murphy-O'Connor (the Cardinal's cousin) on \"Paul the Pastor\". It does not sound good.\n\nThe talk was not given from a prepared script nor was it recorded and therefore I can only go by what I am told by those who were there. Here are some key points that I have summarised from the accounts of many priests. If anyone wishes to offer corrections of serious errors of fact, I will be happy to amend the post.\n\n********************\n\nSt Paul didn't believe in the divinity of Christ - he didn't deny it but his thought hadn't taken him that far.

There is no charge but donations will be welcome.\n\nZenit has news of a new master's program in architecture, sacred arts and liturgy at the European University of Rome of which Fr Uwe Michael Lang is one of the directors. (Cf. Master's Program Aims to Halt Art Crisis). Fr Lang commented on the crisis in sacred art:... a crisis of the deepest roots, a crisis that has swept away, even before art, beauty itself, of which it should be the bearer. The very concept of 'fine arts,' of which the conciliar Constitution on Sacred Liturgy speaks, is debated.Following Hans Urs von Balthasar, he also stressed thatTogether with the loss of the beautiful, the good and the true have also been lost.\n\nThis prohibition seems to make little sense. If marriage is good and can be a legitimate part of the clerical state, as it is in the East for priests and deacons, and in the West for permanent deacons, why should there be a law forbidding marriage after ordination?\n\nThe answer most coherent with the fact of this universal law is that there was an apostolic discipline of clerical continence (i.e. abstinence from sexual union) even for those who were married, and that the existing law, which applies even where clerical marriage and the use of marriage is retained, is a vestige of the ancient discipline.\n\nThis accords with the words of Our Lord:Jesus said, \"Truly, I say to you, there is no one who has left house or brothers or sisters or mother or father or children or lands, for my sa…\n\nAdvertisers seeking to grab customers at every possible opportunity now advertise in lavatories with A4 sized framed posters. One I have seen recently which made my heart sink was for Divorce Online... a free, content rich resource for people in a divorce or separation situation. It allows them to access a wealth of information and services regarding family law matters. We believe in providing as much free information as we can to help our users make informed choices.There is a Gold Service DIY divorce for the knockdown price of £65. Surely the cheapest way to smash up children's lives and undermine the fabric of society! I do recognise the duty of solicitors to represent their clients and gain the best settlement for them, but this does seem somewhat too slick. The whole website is an eloquent testimony to the truth of Pope Paul VI's warning in Humanae Vitae; and I quote:Responsible men can become more deeply convinced of the truth of the doctrine laid down by the Church on t…\n\nApparently, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation's \"Planet Slayer\" site invites young children to take a \"greenhouse gas quiz\", asking them \"how big a pig are you?\". At the end of the quiz, the pig explodes, and ABC tells children at \"what age you should die at so you don't use more than your fair share of Earth's resources!\" Charming!\n\nIn response, ABC managing director Mark Scott insisted that,... the site was not designed to offend certain quarters of the community but to engage children in environmental issues.My question is how this squares with the Child Protection policy of ABC. Could we have access to a copy of this policy?\n\nIn journalistic parlance, this is a \"Man Bites Dog\" story from Agence France Presse: Vatican demands opening of Israeli archives. Walter Brandmuller, president of the Pontifical Committee for Historical Sciences said,I do not understand some critics as most of the Vatican documentation is accessible... while others do not make their documents availableApparently fifteen Israeli archive collections keep documents to which scholars are not allowed access. The Commission investigating the life of Pope Pius XII would like to study these documents.\n\nThanks to Andrew Cusack for linking on Norumbega to the Daily Telegraph blog of Gerald Warner: Is it just me? I particularly liked Only lemon properly complements a gin and tonic and I quote:How many times, in pubs, do I have to lecture captive audiences who convincingly feign ennui as a defensive reaction to their embarrassment at the solecism they are committing, that lemon is the only legitimate accompaniment to a gin and tonic? Tradition is, of course, an adequate reason in itself. But the fact is that, while a slice of lemon complements the gin, the overpowering flavour of lime drowns it completely.As with most of society's evils, he traces the root cause to New Labour although he opines that barmen who rub the lime around the rim of the glass were trained by the Borgias.\n\nThis prompts me to observe the remarkable similarity between Tony Blair and Cesare Borgia. I wonder if they are by any chance related?\n\nIn their public policy they were entirely different, of course.

I particularly appreciated his comment:I also say, \"Take heart!\" for it is obvious from the many young people in England and Wales who love the Church's ancient liturgy that you have done very well in preserving and handing on a love for this liturgy to your children. It is good to hear the Cardinal encouraging families in the context of a speech about the traditional liturgy. I have to say that I also have experience of children growing to love the traditional liturgy and passing on that love to their parents who have been overjoyed that their children have found something that will nourish their faith and keep it strong.\n\nHis Eminence also made special mention of the Merton conference to train priests to celebrate the usus antiquior and gave his blessing to this year's conference.

You can read the LifeSite article and the full text in English translation. Point 4 of the declaration states:From the moment that the ovum is fertilized, a new life is begun that is not part of the father, nor of the mother, but rather a new human being that develops autonomously. Further, something so important is at stake that, from the point of view of moral obligation, the mere probability of the existence of a person is sufficient to justify the absolute prohibition of any intervention made for the purpose of eliminating a human embryo. Human beings must be respected and treated as a person from the instant of their conception and, for that reason, from that same moment the rights of the person must be respected, principally the inviolable right to life of every innocent human being. Human life must be respected from its conception, without exceptions.…\n\nA busy day today up in London. My good friend Lt Col James Sterling Corum is in England to give a lecture to the Defence Academy. We were at Oxford together many years ago and it is always great to catch up with news of his family and his academic work. Jim is an acknowledged expert in military history and especially airpower, and counter-subversion. He has recently written a new book: \"Wolfram von Richthofen. Master of the German Air War\", published by the University Press of Kansas. Wolfram von Richthofen is usually overshadowed by his cousin the \"Red Baron\". Before the second world war, he played a central role in building and developing the Luftwaffe. Jim has another book out in the summer analysing examples of failed decision-making processes by democracies in wartime. Talking to him about the book over lunch, it struck me that the principal lessons could be applied almost exactly to failed decision-making in the Church.

You'll not be sorry. ;-)\n\nI have just received this quotation from the address of Cardinal Castrillon Hoyos to the Latin Mass Society:I am aware that the response of the Pontifical Commission \"Ecclesia Dei\" with regard to the observance of Holy Days of obligation has caused a certain amount of disturbance in some circles. It should be noted that the dates of these Holy Days remain the same in both the Missal of 1962 and the Missal of 1970. When the Holy See has given the Episcopal Conference of a given country permission to move certain Holy Days to the following Sunday, this should be observed by all Catholics in that country. Nothing prevents the celebration of the Feast of the Ascension, for example, on the prior Thursday, but it should be clear that this is not a Mass of obligation and that the Mass of the Ascension should also be celebrated on the following Sunday. This is a sacrifice which I ask you to make with joy as a sign of your unity with the Catholic Church in your country.That's fine.

Latin Mass \"power of silence\" raises UK Catholic decibels). After the Cardinal had spoke about the power of silence in the usus antiquior and its element of contemplation, Elena Curti, deputy editor of the The Tablet, said that:[...] many Catholics like herself were confused at the new emphasis on the old rite.

We stopped in at the Cité Europe shopping mall to buy some good tea, olive oil, a couple of electronic items and a few bottles of nice wine before having a very reasonably-priced lunch at a fish restaurant.\n\nWe had enough time for a visit to Bleriot Plage (I did not have my camera but the photo above captures the scene) and saw some windsurfers skating and jumping over the waves of the Channel. This was the site from which Louis Bleriot made the first cross-channel flight in 1909, winning the £1000 prize offered by the Daily Mail.\n\nThe video clip above shows a part of the recessional at the end of yesterday's Pontifical Mass and it prompts me to post a few personal comments from the experience of assisting at the Mass.\n\nYou can see that I was walking slightly behind His Eminence who held the crozier in a not entirely vertical position. For anyone who is second assistant Deacon on such an occasion, I can warn you that you are liable to be stabbed in the foot by the crozier - as I was twice! I learned to keep out of the way.\n\nThe vestments we wore were heavily embroidered with gold thread but practical in that their Roman form allowed for all the necessary movement during the ceremonies. I now feel much more confident about taking a mitre off - something I have not had much experience of in the past since Bishops nowadays tend to do this themselves.\n\nFr Conlon, the Assistant Priest, had the job of moving the Missal stand and Missal - made of solid brass, it weighted about twenty pounds.

He comments particularly on the important statement by Cardinal Castrillon Hoyos that the Holy Father is offering this form of the Mass for all and that therefore it is something for all parishes, not just \"many parishes\". As Fr Z says,This was stated by someone who knows what he is talking about. He wouldn't have said it if it was according to the Holy Father's will. how can we know this? He made a similar statement before. Review this. If the Secretariat of State or the Holy Father had a problem with what Card. Castrillon said back then, he wouldn't be saying it in public now.(Cf. UK: Card. Castrillon Hoyos - TLM in \"Not many parishes – all parishes\"!)\n\nFollowing on from Justin's report, here are some photos from today's Pontifical High Mass at Westminster Cathedral, celebrated by Cardinal Castrillon Hoyos. Above you can see His Eminence solemnly entering the Cathedral, giving his blessing as he passed along.\n\nThe push-chairs illustrate the youth of the congregation: there were many young families with babies. Their occasional wailing did not matter a bit.\n\nAbove you can see Fr Hudson, the Subdeacon (centre), myself as the second Assistant Deacon (left) and Fr Wadsworth as Deacon for the Mass (right)\n\nThe Cathedral was completely packed for the Mass. These photos were taken from about two-thirds the way down the nave. People were standing at the back and all the way down the side aisles.\n\nToday was a magnificent, joyful and hope-filled celebration of the Roman Rite in its finest form with the Cathedral Choir singing and over two thousand people participating actively by uniting themselves spiritually with what was happening at the al…\n\nHere is a report from \"Justin\" in the comments box fof Fr Zuhlsdorf's blog \"What Does the Prayer Really Say\". It is such a good summary of today's Mass that I felt it would be best to post it in full:I have just returned from the Pontifical High Mass at the Throne for the Feast of S. Basil the Great celebrated by Dario Card. Castrillion Hoyos, President of Pontifical Commission Ecclesia Dei. You will be happy to know that the Cathedral was overflowing – all seats were filled 30 mins prior to Mass, the side chapels were packed, and the side aisles and crossings were standing room only. Many of the congregants of the overflowing cathedral were youth, or families with children. I am 24 myself, and I would estimate that at least half the congregants (surely numbering more than 1500) were in my age group or younger.\n\nThe famed Cathedral Choir (the actual Cathedral Choir) sung their pieces with the professionalism and technical wizardry superior to any Oxbridge col…\n\nThis evening, I had the privilege of attending dinner at the Travellers Club in London with HE Darío Cardinal Castrillón Hoyos and the Committee of the Latin Mass Society, together with the other sacred ministers for tomorrow's Mass, Frs Wadsworth and Conlon of the diocese of Westminster, and Fr Hudson of the Institute of Christ the King, Sovereign Priest, together with Fr Ronald Creighton-Jobe of the London Oratory. Fr Christopher Tuckwell, the new administrator of Westminster Cathedral was also there: we are all very grateful to him for his hospitality and for making available some of the Cathedral's finest vestments and plate for tomorrow's Pontifical Mass.\n\nAfter dinner, Julian Chadwick, the LMS Chairman gave a rousing speech in which he noted that the visit of Cardinal Hoyos does much to fulfil the legitimate aspirations for which the society has worked over several decades.\n\nCardinal Hoyos replied in a moving and heartfelt address in which he expressed the hope that tomo…\n\nPriests in England and Wales recently received a copy of \"An appeal to the Bishops of England and Wales to ordain priests for our parishes.\" Married priests, that is. The petition from \"Marriedpriests-ew.org\" reads:We, the undersigned Catholics, wish to express our support for our bishops who are preparing the Catholic Church in England and Wales for new forms of ministry and leadership. We request the Catholic Bishops Conference to place the following items on the agenda for their next plenary meeting.\n\nWe ask that the bishops:\n\n1. Acknowledge that there is a major crisis in ministry within the Catholic Church in England and Wales. 2. Acknowledge that there is no doctrinal or theological barrier to the ordination of married men. Our church has already ordained married former Anglican priests. 3. Take practical steps toward ordaining suitably qualified married men. 4.

It is a charming and very readable account of a journey through Bavaria by two noble ladies who have retained and exemplify that genuine nobility which finds its source and fulfilment in the faith which built Europe.\n\nHuman Life International has drawn up a Clergy Pledge of Assent to Humanae Vitae. As they explain:In the face of a whole generation of silence and dissent to this most critical of all papal encyclicals, HLI is endeavoring to form a new generation of assent, both from the ranks of the existing clergy and among those who are studying for Holy Orders.You can read more about the pledge at the HLI homepage and you can download a copy of the pledge (pdf 105kb) which bishops, priests, deacons and seminarians are all invited to sign.\n\n(I wonder if it would be possible for HLI to arrange for this to be signed by email or on the web?)\n\nFr Benjamin Durham FSSP has been visiting Finland. Above is a photo of the Missa Cantata at St Henry's Cathedral last Sunday. The Summorum blog has details (with some text in English) and photos of his visits to Holy Cross at Tampere, the Missionaries of Charity, Maala in the Finnish countryside (with a game of \"mölkky\"), and today to the Carmelite sisters in Esopo. I was very glad to hear that he also had the opportunity to meet the Bishop of Helsinki.\n\nPhilip at Carpe Canem has an excellent post concerning the recent decision of the Catholic Children's Society (dioceses of Southwark, Arundel and Brighton, and Portsmouth) to give in to the government's demands that they place children with same sex couples, and to change the name of the society to the \"Cabrini Children's Society.\" (Cf. Mother Cabrini must be turning in her grave!)\n\nAs Philip rightly says:This is nothing less than the misappropriation of the good name of Mother Frances Xavier Cabrini, and the linking of her name to something with which she would profoundly disagree – a complete perversion of her principles! Mother Cabrini spent her life caring for children, rather than seeing them abandoned or given up into dangerous or sinful situations, founding orphanages to protect and care for the vulnerable.The Catholic Children's Society currently receives income from the following: An annual collection at Sunday MassOfferings at the Christmas CribLenten …\n\nRadiant Light, the website for the devotional and instructional paintings by Elizabeth Wang, has produced a Lesson Plan for Teachers.

This was the site of the Tyburn Tree, the place of execution of many of our English Catholic martyrs. The site used to be marked by the small memorial pictured above. Unfortunately, the traffic island has recently been refashioned and the memorial is no longer there. This is a pity because I know that many Catholics used to like to venerate the cross, even from the opposite pavement (it is a busy road and the island is fenced off.)\n\nMy guess is that this is merely an oversight and that the planners did not realise the significance of the cross. It would not cost much to place a small memorial on the site of the Tyburn Tree similar to the one that has been lost.\n\nThe traffic island is on the boundary of two wards of Westminster Council, Bryanston and Dorset Square and Hyde Park.

{"text": "Over the next few weeks, the Lord will RESET the vision.\n\nThis morning I heard the words, \"Reset, Refresh, Reboot.. FIRE\" and I felt strongly that the Spirit of God is bringing about a RESETTING, REFRESHING and REBOOTING of vision. I had such a strong sense that the Lord is releasing REVELATION and CONFIRMATION of the VISION that He has given His people. I felt so strongly to watch over the next few weeks how the Lord will RESET the vision. It was such a STRONG sense of the Lord CONCRETING the vision.\n\nVISION IS UNDER ATTACK:\n\nI saw many suddenly having the vision God has given them UNDER ATTACK. Suddenly fear, confusion, doubt, naysayers and unexpected occurrences were coming against the vision, and leaving many in anxiety and doubt concerning the vision God had released. I felt the heart of God decreeing \"THE VISION HASN'T CHANGED\". Many are carrying a vision right now that is completely new to what they have done before, a vision for this new season that is \"against the grain\" in some ways and full of change, and an attack has come against that vision leaving many feeling like, \"Am I moving in the right direction? Have I heard God right? Am I doing the right thing?\"\n\nI prophesy over you right now in the name of Jesus that there has been an attack that has come against the vision, because you are moving in the right direction. Fear will tell you that you are being attacked in the vision because you are moving in the wrong direction, but the truth is, the enemy sees the NEW VISION that the Lord has given you and he is trying to stop you from moving into the new land and new vision the Lord has given you.\n\nGod is especially CONCRETING VISION for 2018 right now and especially over the next few weeks.\n\nREBOOTING:\n\nGod is and will continue by His Spirit to bring about a great REBOOTING. He is REBOOTING the vision through supernatural confirmations of His vision. He is REFRESHING the vision. The Holy Spirit will continue to bring about supernatural confirmations to bring a REBOOTING so you can remove the \"bugs\", the \"lies\", the \"attack\", the \"fear\", the \"doubt\" that the enemy is attempting to put on you. The VISION the enemy is attacking, is the next area of significant increase, revelation and favor in the vision He has given you.\n\nFIRE:\n\nThe Lord is calling His people to \"come away\"and in that place He is refreshing, rebooting, reseting, concreting and confirming the vision. Because of the new vision that He is bubbling up within His people, the enemy is attempting to bring great fear and death to the new vision, but as you stay close to Him and decree what He is saying, trust and obey Him, you will see major increase in the vision. I saw FIRE falling upon the vision. In the \"come away\" place, the fire of His presence and love is going to fall upon His people in a new and fresh way.\n\nThe revelation He is going to bring from the Word of God concerning the new visions He is releasing, is going to come with such fire, the Word will be like FIRE IN YOUR BONES (Jeremiah 20:9), the fire of His heart and His Word will be SO STRONG within you, that you will not be able to contain the joy and revelation that has come through His Word and the revelation released to you concerning the vision He has given you.\n\nFAMILY IS KEY IN THE NEW:\n\nI saw a specific attack against \"family\" right now and the vision that God is releasing upon families. Stand against the attack that is coming against \"family\". Rebuke the lies the enemy is speaking regarding family.\n\nThe Lord spoke to me a few months ago and I heard the words \"2018, The Year of Family\" and there are layers of revelation concerning that word, but in a dream recently the Lord showed me an attack against \"families\" and the family unit right now, because of what God is doing and about to do IN family. The enemy is attempting to steal, kill and destroy and hinder what God is doing in family, so PROTECT THE VISION. Protect the promise of what God has told you, showed you about your family, for your family, for the family of God, for other families. Protect it with your faith, prayer and trusting God.\n\nFamily is VERY KEY in what God is doing and ABOUT to do. Increase, multiplication, revival, restoration, favor, healing, freedom is falling upon family. Watch and see what God is going to do through families and the family unit, especially in 2018!Thomas M Iipinge\n\nMember\n\nOctober 24, 2017 3:43 PM\n\nGod blessed you so much Mrs lana.

(source: company press release or website)\n\nWhy We Like It: It might seem a bit odd to consider bullish call positions in a homebuilder in a rising interest rate environment. The yield on the 10-year bond has risen sharply lately and that's putting pressure on mortgage rates, which have risen to levels not seen since 2003. Yet historically speaking mortgage rates remain relatively low. Plus, there have been renewed comments that the Fed might be nearing the end of its tightening cycle. We also recently entered the spring/summer building and selling season for homes so maybe investors are counting on a few strong quarters from the builders. Several stocks in the group appear to have built an inverse or bullish head-and-shoulders pattern and they're all on the verge of breaking out above resistance at the neckline of this pattern. BZH is one such stock and today's gain looks like a breakout. We are going to suggest calls here but the 100-dma (near $69.00) and the $70.00 mark could still offer resistance so more conservative traders may want to wait for a move over $70.00 before initiating positions. Currently the P&F chart points to an $87 target but if BZH can trade over $69.00 it will produce a new triple-top breakout buy signal. We are going to target the $74.50-75.00 range. However, please keep in mind that this will be a short-term play. We do not want to hold over the April 27th earnings report.\n\nSuggested Options: We are suggesting the May calls but we plan to exit on April 26th to avoid holding over earnings.\n\nCompany Description: Marvell is the leader in development of storage, communications, and consumer silicon solutions. The company's diverse product portfolio includes switching, transceiver, communications controller, wireless and storage solutions that power the entire communications infrastructure including enterprise, metro, home and storage networking. (source: company press release or website)\n\nWhy We Like It: The SOX semiconductor index has reversed course. After a five-week consolidation pattern the semis have rebounded and now the SOX index is breaking out over the 520 level and technical resistance at the 50-dma. Strength in the sector is helping fuel as rebound and a breakout in MRVL. The stock spent about three weeks consolidating between $54.00 and $58.00 and now shares are breaking out on rising volume. The technical picture is positive and today's high-volume move is a breakout over the $60.00 mark and its 100-dma. We also like the Point & Figure chart, which looks very bullish for MRVL and currently points to a $73 target. We are suggesting bullish positions above $58.00 and our target is going to be the $65.50-66.00 range. The next level of resistance appears to be $66.50-67.00.\n\nSuggested Options: We are suggesting the May calls.\n\nBUY CALL MAY 55.00 UVM-EK open interest=4335 current ask $7.40 BUY CALL MAY 57.50 UVM-EY open interest=2156 current ask $5.80 BUY CALL MAY 60.00 UVM-EL open interest=4951 current ask $4.40 BUY CALL MAY 62.50 UVM-ES open interest=2652 current ask $3.30", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "b9797fc5-73fd-46ba-89d7-5f849575e462", "url": "http://www.optioninvestor.com/page/oin/strategies/new/2006/04-06.html"}

{"text": "Leatherface Poster Teases Texas Chainsaw Origin\n\nBy B. Alan Orange — September 4th, 2015\n\nThe slasher flick is about to tread into untested territory with Leatherface. It's not unique for showing us a killer's origin story. Halloween and Friday the 13th both did that right out of the gate. What we've never seen are the teenage years for any of these monsters. Leatherface changes all that by delving into the mythos and early years of the killer at the heart of 1974's The Texas Chainsaw Massacre. Millennium Films has unleashed the scary first poster for Leatherface, and it promises a gritty, rain-soaked excursion into the mind of a real Psycho.\n\nLeatherface isn't just an origin story for the original The Texas Chainsaw Massacre. It's also a Scooby-Doo, Where Are You! type murder-mystery. A young nurse is kidnapped by four violent teens who escape from a mental hospital and take her on a road trip from hell. Pursued by an equally deranged lawman out for revenge, one of these teens is destined for tragedy and horrors that will destroy his mind, molding him into the monster we now call Leatherface.\n\nThe movie will have fans wondering who the real killer is, and should be a hoot at the Magic Johnson theater chain, where you're sure to get a little help identifying the real Leatherface from the always electric and very fun crowd. Like reboots in recent past, this movie, too, is positioning itself as the 'real' tale that lead to the events seen in The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, directed by horror legend Tobe Hooper. The prequel marks the eighth overall entry in the franchise, which currently includes the 1984 original, the Tobe Hooper directed 1986 sequel The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2, 1990's Leatherface: Texas Chainsaw Massacre III, 1994's The Return of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre which is notorious for featuring Renée Zellweger and Matthew McConaughey before they were big stars, the The Texas Chainsaw Massacre remake, which launched in 2003 and claimed to be 'the real story', 2006's The Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Beginning, which also sold itself as a prequel, and the last installment, Texas Chainsaw 3D, which attempted to reboot the horror series, calling itself the 'true' sequel to the original 1974 movie. As you can see, the Leatherface backstory is all over the map, with no real connective tissue between some of the films.\n\nFrench filmmaking duo Julian Maury and Alexandre Bustillo are at the helm of Leatherface, their primary goal being to inject this franchise with some fresh new energy, hoping to carry it over into future sequels. Seth M. Sherwood makes his first foray into horror with the Leatherface screenplay. The movie boasts a decent enough cast, with Stephen Dorff leading the charge as the deranged sheriff. Angela Bettis and Sam Strike are also featured in this prequel.\n\nLeatherface and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre are both based on the legend of Ed Gein, an American killer and body snatcher who gained widespread notoriety after authorities discovered exhumed corpses from local graveyards inside his home, some of whom he'd fashioned into trophies and keepsakes. Psycho's Norman Bates is also based on Ed Gein. A&E's Bates Motel delves into the teenage persona of Bates quite nicely, beating Leatherface to the punch by three seasons. But if this member of the Sawyer clan is anything like what we've seen in previous movies, this will certainly be a wilder, much different take on the gruesome legend. And it all starts here with this poster. Take a look, lets just hope the shoes don't give it away (they don't look asylum issue, do they?).", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "804c841b-bd23-4e89-a19c-fcccb7c369d1", "url": "https://movieweb.com/amp/leatherface-movie-poster-2016/"}
{"text": "PALCO\n\nPacific Lumber's Fate in Judge's Hands After Mediation Fails\n\nBy David McLaughlin Dow Jones Newswires April 28, 2008\n\nA mediation session aimed at resolving a battle over the Pacific Lumber Co.'s post-bankruptcy future failed over the weekend, which could force a judge to decide the fate of the struggling logging company.\n\nSettlement talks that took place on Friday and Saturday between rival creditors in the case didn't result in a deal, according to people with knowledge of the mediation who spoke on condition that they not be identified.\n\nWith mediation failing, Judge Richard Schmidt of the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Corpus Christi, Texas, will continue a hearing Tuesday to approve a plan to take Pacific Lumber out of bankruptcy.\n\nSchmidt ordered the mediation on April 18 during a break in the hearing, urging the rival creditor groups who are fighting to take control of Pacific Lumber's assets to reach a settlement.\n\nReferring to himself as a \"loose cannon,\" Schmidt warned them that he would have to resolve the dispute if they didn't. It was the second time he had ordered mediation in the case.\n\nThe confirmation hearing is set to resume Tuesday, with Pacific Lumber scheduled to present testimony in support of its plan to reorganize, a proposal that calls for building luxury homes on a small portion of its timberlands in Northern California.\n\nThe plan does not have enough support from creditors to win confirmation, and Schmidt has called it \"dead in the water.\"\n\nThat has left creditors fighting for control of the company. Bondholders of Pacific Lumber subsidiary Scotia Pacific Co. want Schmidt to allow them to auction Scotia Pacific's 200,000 acres of timberlands, the collateral securing their notes.\n\nMeanwhile, Pacific Lumber's bankruptcy lender, hedge fund Marathon Asset Management, and California logging company Mendocino Redwood Co. LLC have offered to pump new money into Pacific Lumber and take control of the company.\n\nBoth camps have urged Schmidt to reject their rival's plan, but Schmidt has signaled during the confirmation hearing that he see problems with each one.\n\nAt the end of testimony on April 11, the judge said the bondholders' proposal has \"practical problems\" because it only applies to Scotia Pacific but doesn't affect Pacific Lumber, according to a transcript.\n\nSchmidt alsoThat has left both sides battling over the value of the timberlands, which Schmidt will have to rule on. Marathon and Mendocino have set a value of $430 million, while bondholders say that's too low and point to a $603 million offer from bondholder Beal Bank in Plano, Texas.\n\nBondholders, represented by The Bank of New York Mellon Corp. (BK), have warned Schmidt that approving the Marathon-Mendocino plan \"would severely damage an already shaky credit market.\"\n\n\"The MRC/Marathon plan, if confirmed, would do more than simply cause irreparable harm to the current noteholders – it would signal to the markets that, despite the representations of an issuer of secured notes or the specific terms of their issuance, holders of secured notes cannot depend on, at least, the return of their collateral,\" the Bank of New York said.\n\nBut Marathon-Mendocino have won the support of unsecured creditors in the case as well as California and federal agencies in charge of regulating logging. Marathon and Mendocino say unlike the bondholders, their plan ensures Pacific Lumber's survival.\n\n\"The MRC/Marathon plan, unlike any other plan that has been proposed, will maintain the economic vitality of Northern California by preserving business operations, going-concern value, jobs and pensions,\" they said.", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "07d0bc71-b68c-4ffd-ac40-8465da3691b0", "url": "http://www.hrcllc.com/palco/pacific-lumbers-fate-in-judges-hands-after-mediation-fails/"}

{"text": "Menu\n\nMy month of June 2015 so far\n\nThe first week I was set to work onsite at a client in Surrey, however this was rescheduled (which can happen last minute in audit) and so I was in the office working on an accounts prep for a small property company. Accounts preps are rarely straightforward as you have to get an understanding of the client by looking at their prior year accounts and develop an expectation of how their accounts should form this year.\n\nI was set to work on this fairly autonomously, but with some help from a few friendly seniors I was able to produce the bulk of the work by the end of the week. That Friday we also had a leaving lunch and evening drinks for the Assistant Manager, Dino Campanaro, who had been at Shipleys for 7 years since he was a trainee. It was sad to see him leave and we wish him all the best in his future career.\n\nThe following week I was back at Kaplan to finish my Financial Accounting and Reporting tuition – one of the 3 exams I will be sitting in September. We were given a mock exam, which seems scary several months before the exam but was just to test our progress so far. We begin the 'revision phase' in August and so until then it's a matter of solidifying my understanding of the course. I will begin tuition for Tax Compliance and Audit & Assurance next week.\n\nThis week, the client side of things in the office has been slow so I have used the time to update my training log ready for my 6 monthly review next month. This involves keeping a log of how many hours worth of audit and accounts work I have achieved so far, as sufficient practical experience is part of the requirement to become ACA qualified. There are also 'skill ladders' in areas ranging from team work to technical competency that need to be achieved at the end of the 3 year training course. Part of the 6 monthly review is to ensure the firm allocates your work to areas to help you stay on track to achieve these.\n\nToday is the assessment day for the August intake at Shipleys. Myself and some fellow trainees and seniors will be spending lunch answering questions to the candidates and showing them around the office to give them a feel for what it would be like to join us. Jane has given an insight into the day below, and whilst it's a challenging and nervous day, it is also an exciting chance to potentially enter into a fantastic career with us.", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "2ac680f4-e61a-45ab-864f-29d3fd65ff7f", "url": "http://graduate.shipleys.com/my-month-of-june-2015-so-far/"}

{"text": "\n\nSunday, July 18, 2010\n\nSaturday, July 17, 2010\n\nBob and I got to spend this afternoon with Annie! We hadn't seen her in at least nine years. When Bob and I bought the house on Monticello Avenue here in Dallas in 1996, Annie was living in the apartment over the garage. She called it her \"treehouse\". She asked if she could stay there and of course we said, \"YES!\" Annie was like another one of our kids and we loved having her as part of our family. Annie has a Master's degree in pottery making. She had beautiful pottery displayed all around her apartment and within a short time, I also had Annie's pottery displayed all around our house. One day we came home from work and there were pottery shards all over our driveway. Annie was throwing some of her pieces of low-standard pottery off of her balcony and smashing them. I was very upset. Not for the fact that she was littering our driveway with her pottery, but because she was breaking her BEAUTIFUL PIECES! I loved every piece of pottery Annie made, perfect or not! I rescued a few of her pieces of pottery that would have been smashed, as they didn't live up to her standard of pottery making. I collected the pieces of pottery in a bucket and I used some of those pieces to put around the outside of flower pots. While Annie was with us this afternoon, she talked me into possibly teaching some jewelry making classes in Burleson, where she will be teaching some pottery classes. If you are interested in seeing some of Annie's pottery, take a look at her website -- \n\nFriday, July 16, 2010\n\nI was digging through some boxes today looking for something and I found this old photo of me. It says \"Spring 1974\" on the back of it. In the Spring of 1974, I had been married to my first husband, David, for four years and I was working as a receptionist for Playboy Magazine in Chicago. I saw a billboard about becoming a model and I decided I wanted to take the classes and learn about how to become a model. I took some very interesting classes on how to walk, sit and how to get in and out of a car properly. I had a class on how to apply make up and hair styling and what color of shoes to wear with what color of dress. I remember that you are supposed to wear shoes darker than the hem of your skirt and to NEVER wear WHITE SHOES, unless you had on an all white outfit. There were several girls in the classes, but I am sure none of them actually became models. Someone took our photos with our stats, such as height, weight, etc. on the photo and this is the photo taken of me -- Height - 5'5\", Weight - 110 pounds. Sure wish I still had that body!\n\nSunday, July 11, 2010\n\nSaturday, July 10, 2010\n\nI love the jewelry that the ladies wear on the TV show, \"Bones\".

I plan to make more necklaces like the ones worn on the TV show. I will add this one to my Etsy website for sale.\n\nMonday, July 5, 2010\n\nBob had today off work and we wanted to spend the day together doing something fun, exciting, and different. When we are home together, Bob is either on his computer or watching TV and I am beading. We wanted to do something other than our hobbies today. We Googled \"day trips from Dallas\" and decided to head down I-80 to East TX and see how far we got. We went through Terrell and Wills Point. Wills Point is the Blue Bird Capital of Texas. There was a Bluebird Cafe that looked interesting to have lunch in Wills Point, but we weren't quite ready at the time. Another time perhaps. Bob and I like to eat at the local places and not the chain restaurants. We continued down I-80 to Grand Saline. We found a local Mexican restaurant called Papadales where we had lunch. Very yummy! I wanted to see the salt flats, but Bob missed the turn off, so we continued down I-80 to Gladewater. It is the Antique Capital of East Texas! We stopped and walked down the main drag and went into some of the antique stores that were open today. Also in Gladewater, there still stands the Snavely #1 Oil Well. We were too hot and tired to continue any further east, so we decided to head back towards Dallas and see if we could find the Morton Salt mines. We did and I took a couple of photos, but we didn't ask for a tour. It was a fun and interesting day even though the temps were in the high 90's. You can see more of my photos at share.shutterfly.com/action/welcome?sid=8EbMmLJq3aKLjw\n\nSunday, July 4, 2010\n\nBob and I decided to go to Royse City tonight to listen to the Claxton Welch band and have dinner at Fish Camp. Our friend Jarad Calkins plays in the Claxton Welch band and his wife Allegra, whom I worked with for five years at Project SEED, was also there with their son Bryce. We had never been to Royce City or the Fish Camp restaurant until tonight. We asked our friends Barry & Pat to go with us. We also asked our friends Kathryn & Max, but they didn't make it. Kathryn returned around noon today from a vacation in Puerto Rico, so I'm sure she had jet lag. It was a beautiful evening, so we sat at a picnic table outside and watched the kids fish in the pond. They mostly caught small fish, turtles and snakes. The music was very good and so was the food. We enjoyed the evening. We even saw a few fireworks driving back home.\n\nSaturday, July 3, 2010\n\nGuess who is Resident of the Month at The Mondrian? ME!!! Well, NeeNee & CheeChee's Beaded Things is being featured as Resident of the Month for July 2010. There is a fishbowl on the security desk in the lobby of The Mondrian where Bob and I live. The fishbowl is for residents to put their business cards in and one is drawn each month. That person or business is featured in The Mondrian newsletter. I didn't know about the plaque that is placed on the security desk in the lobby, so that was just an extra bonus!

{"text": "Schlabach also reports that Boykin, a senior, disobeyed team rules before the incident occurred.\n\nMark Schlabach @Mark_Schlabach\n\nAccording to sources, Trevone Boykin was in his hotel room when TCU coaches did curfew check at midnight Thursday and then went back out\n\nTCU head coach Gary Patterson released a statement through the school expressing his frustration in the matter, via ESPN.com's Jake Trotter:\n\nJake Trotter @Jake_Trotter\n\nBoykin suspended for the Alamo Bowl, per TCU. \n\nBoykin's arrest is another in a series of disappointments for a Horned Frogs team that entered the 2015 season as a national title contender. Injuries to Boykin and star receiver Josh Doctson, coupled with a poor defense, derailed those hopes as TCU limped to a 10-2 record.\n\nWith the surging Oregon Ducks next on the slate, TCU's downward spiral appears primed to continue.\n\nAfter starting the season 3-3 with a new quarterback in Vernon Adams Jr., Oregon reeled off six straight victories to close out the year, including wins over Stanford and USC.\n\nSince returning from injury after sitting out the Oct. 10 loss to Washington State, Adams is tearing up opposing defenses. The graduate transfer has thrown 21 touchdowns to just four interceptions in his last six games while throwing for over 300 yards in four of those contests.\n\nStar running back Royce Freeman is also in the midst of a fantastic season, rushing for 1,706 yards and 14 touchdowns. Freeman has 847 rushing yards in his last six games, with Oregon averaging 45 points per game over that span.\n\nThe Ducks rely on perimeter speed, something TCU struggled with this season. Just ask Oklahoma State receiver James Washington, who burned the Horned Frogs for 184 yards and three scores.\n\nOregon's offense is now back on track, but TCU is going in a different direction. Since Boykin picked up a nagging ankle injury in Week 10 vs. Kansas, the Horned Frogs have struggled to consistently move the ball. Without Boykin for most of the game, TCU put up a measly 23 points against Kansas and was stagnant before a late surge gave it 29 points against Oklahoma. When Boykin returned against Baylor, the offense failed to take advantage of a depleted Bears team, putting up 28 points in a rain-soaked overtime match.\n\nSenior backup quarterback Bram Kohlhausen, the presumed starter for the 2016 Alamo Bowl, struggled to move the ball through the air, an area of weakness for the Oregon defense. He completed only five passes against Oklahoma and threw for only 122 yards against Kansas. That's not a good sign going against an Oregon defense ranking third-to-last in passing defense in the FBS, right behind Kansas.\n\nMaking matters worse will be the absence of Doctson, by far TCU's top receiving option. This will allow Oregon to focus on KaVontae Turpin, the Horned Frogs' top playmaker, who is second on the team with eight receiving touchdowns.\n\nWith Turpin as the biggest threat through the air, Oregon can pack defenders in the box to slow down running back Aaron Green, a 1,000-yard rusher who becomes TCU's primary ball-carrier with the limited passing game.\n\nTCU's expected offensive struggles will give plenty of opportunities for the Oregon offense to rack up points. The Horned Frogs give up a modest 26 points per game, but the Ducks' extra possessions will cause that number to increase.\n\nBoykin accounted for 4,187 yards and 40 touchdowns this season. With him, TCU had a chance. Without him, TCU will end its season on an even more sour note.", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "7797efdb-2d06-4207-b665-e0aa4198984d", "url": "http://bleacherreport.com/articles/2603998-with-trevone-boykin-suspended-tcu-faces-uphill-battle-vs-oregon-in-alamo-bowl"}

Sound Lounge was a recording home to bands such as Ballyhoo!, Tribal Seeds and many more. Armed with knowledge, experience and true passion for what they do, Kash'd Out's focus is to put out positive energy through catchy tunes, to help the continued growth of our flourishing reggae/rock community.\n\nOnce their self-titled debut EP was complete, Kash'd Out recruited Joey Brohawn on Bass, Marshall Hearne on drums and Nick Gudzan on keys. Now, with the line-up complete, the band hit the studio to record tracks for their second record. During that time, frontman Greg Shields was also co-writing 'Girls' — Ballyhoo!'s new record (Now available on iTunes!). Shortly after those sessions, Greg traveled with Ballyhoo! on the Vans Warped Tour 2016 where he was introduced to Hawaii's own reggae rock legends, Pepper. Since Greg had also co-written Ballyhoo!'s \"Daydreams\" which was released through Pepper's label, LAW Records, he patiently waited for the right moment to show them Kash'd Out's new material.\n\nFast forward to 2017, Kash'd Out is fresh off of a nationwide tour with Pepper/Less Than Jake followed by another with Pacific Dub, and their new full-length album aptly named \"The Hookup\" drops May 26th on LAW Records and pre-order begins March 31st. Kash'd Out is constantly on the road, making themselves easy to find on a stage near you!", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "d47a9f72-aa3b-459d-a05a-8e8bb46a00cd", "url": "http://www.surfandrock.tv/banda-recomendada-kashd-out/"}

{"text": "Beaver Dam Creek, TN – 05/06/2015\n\nMy son's graduation from Fuqua Business School, my niece's wedding, and visits to my sister and friends were all in the plans as I boarded a U.S. Airways jet and made the flight from Denver to Tri Cities, TN. While working at Air Products and Chemicals I became acquainted with David Luther, the owner of an industrial gas distributor business that was acquired in the 90's, and we discovered that we both had a passion for fly fishing. David L. vacationed in Colorado several times since my departure from Air Products, and we met on the stream several times. David L. offered me an open invitation to visit him in Tennessee to sample some of the local quality rivers, so I decided to accept his offer, and I added three days to the front of my southeastern U.S. tour.\n\nDavid picked me up at the small northeastern Tennessee airport and transported me to his beautiful home on the edge of Bristol, TN. After dinner at Quaker Steak and Lube, we returned to the house, and David L. called the information line for the South Holston River. Unfortunately he discovered that the operators were releasing water all day on Wednesday, and this made flows too high to effectively wade fish. I read articles about the sulfur hatch on the South Holston, and I was quite anxious to experience the quality fishing that was described. David L. was undeterred, and he suggested that we would float the tailwater in his john boat, and he was confident that we would have success.\n\nBecause our day now involved a two pronged approach that included wade fishing a nearby Appalachian freestone waterway called Beaver Dam Creek and then floating the South Holston in a boat in the afternoon, we were delayed a bit with the task of hitching the boat to David L.'s Suburban and then dropping it at his brother's house near the river. We then continued without the burden of the boat trailer over a high mountain ridge to a town called Shady Valley, home of an annual cranberry festival. David told me that Shady Valley was the farthest south that cranberries could be grown, and he pointed to an area to our right that used to consist of bogs formed by Beaver Dam Creek.\n\nBeaver Dam Creek Is a Beautiful Mountain Stream\n\nWe turned left in Shady Valley and proceeded along the gorgeous stream until we entered Cherokee National Forest, and then we found a nice wide parking space among the dense trees and rhododendrons and prepared to fish. David had a neat way of marking the entry points to the stream that facilitated playing leap frog. He pulled a wide yellow tape from his bag, and then we found a suitable stick to which he knotted the highly visible yellow ribbon. When the upstream angler entered the stream, he planted the stick along the bank. When the downstream fisherman arrived at the marker, he simply removed it and then walked upstream to a point above the upstream fisherman and planted the marker again.\n\nThe weather was ideal with sunshine and high temperatures in the low 80's, but the thick forest canopy along Beaver Dam Creek blocked the sun's rays, and the air temperature was comfortable in the shade. The size of the stream was also ideal with a width that was somewhat larger than Brush Creek in Colorado. The flows were high but clear and probably perfect for early May in eastern Tennessee.\n\nI planted the yellow marker and waded into the stream below an inviting pool, while David L. hiked along a faint path to a position farther downstream. I assessed the circumstances and decided to launch my southeastern tour with a Chernobyl ant, ultra zug bug and hares ear nymph. This trio of flies have been my most productive imitations over the last year, so why not see if they worked in the southeast? Unfortunately the strategy did not pay dividends, and I fished for twenty minutes and through several nice holes with only a refusal. If they refused the Chernobyl, could this mean they were looking to the surface for their food? I noticed a few caddis buzzing about near the surface, so I switched to a size 14 gray stimulator.\n\nThis Stimulator Produced Two Trout\n\nThe bushy single dry fly changed my fortunes and yielded two buttery wild brown trout. The second fish slurped the attractor dry after I spotted a rise in a run near the head of a deep pool. Catching the brown on a high floating stimulator on a swollen crystal clear mountain stream lined with rhododendrons was exactly the vision I had when I began fishing. Unfortunately I could not get comfortable with this style of fishing, as I covered more very attractive water with no results. Doubts crept into my mind over the effectiveness of a dry fly in high cold spring flows, so I decided to convert to a nymphing approach.\n\nA Bright Brown Trout with a Stimulator Lip\n\nA Rainbow Snatched the Ultra Zug Bug\n\nI knotted an ultra zug bug to my line as my top offering and then added the hares ear nymph as my point. This move paid off, and I began catching fish. One especially delicious deep run yielded two nice rainbows and my best fish of the afternoon; a thirteen inch chunky brown trout that tugged the ultra zug bug at the very top of the run. By 2:30 I landed six feisty trout from Beaver Dam Creek; two rainbows and four browns. At this point David L. caught up to me, and he suggested that we should find our way back to the car if we hoped to sample the South Holston River.\n\nA Pretty Section of Beaver Dam Creek\n\nThe three hours on Beaver Dam Creek turned out to be my favorite outing for the Tennessee and Virginia portion of my southeastern United States trip. The ice cold clear mountain flows, the thick mountain vegetation, and the bright green of fresh spring growth supplemented the brightly colored wild trout. It was a sensory delight.\n\nHi Fred – I was visiting a friend who lives in Bristol, TN so I went off of his recommendation and never looked at a hatch chart. My fishing visit in May was the first and perhaps only time I will fish in Beaver Dam Creek. Nice mountain stream though.\n\nThanks for getting back…the streams and rivers i this area are fairly hard to fish and the fish are very particular…I changed flys on the Watauga River 8 times today and had only one bump…the day before I caught and released two rainbows…when all else fails I go to nymphs and sometimes, more often than not, that doesn't work either…However the guides have no trouble in taking fish for their paying customers. Midges are popular but I can't se to tie a #22 on a tippet…", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "4a8fa55c-1878-43cd-bf25-605caf72b09e", "url": "http://wellerfish.me/beaver-dam-creek-tn-05062015/"}

{"text": "Flexing some financial muscle\n\nWell before the Enron collapse and other corporate scandals prompted Congress to set down corporate governance requirements in the form of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, a number of the largest institutional investors were using the muscle the scale of their stock holdings provided in an effort to influence corporate behavior.\n\nThe California Public Employees' Retirement System has long been at the forefront of those efforts, and hasn't tired of the fight yet, yesterday releasing its latest list of companies the nation's largest public pension fund is citing for what it sees as lackluster financial performance.\n\nAmong those finding a spot on CalPERS 2007 Focus List is Marsh & McLennan Cos. Inc., whose stock has \"underperformed relative to the S&P 500 and its industry peer index\" over the past one, three and five year periods, the $230 billion pension fund said.\n\nCalPERS other beefs with Marsh appear to include what it considers excessive executive severance packages–the fund is pushing a shareholder proposal this year that would require that Marsh seek shareholder ratification of any severance agreement providing benefits with a total present value greater than 2.99 times the officer's combined base salary and target bonus.\n\nInclusion on CalPERS annual list might not be all bad, though. The pension fund cites a Wilshire Associates study that suggests the \"CalPERS Effect\" shows the stock of focus list companies outperforms the S&P 500 Index by 3.1% per year over the five years following their time in CalPERS spotlight.", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "5bf47beb-80f6-4291-b31c-b987d97213e3", "url": "https://roddzblog.wordpress.com/2007/03/16/flexing-some-financial-muscle/"}

{"text": "\n\nWednesday, November 26, 2014\n\nWhen popular than I could have ever imagined, with this blog becoming secondary.\n\nThis is fine with me because I don't aspire to be a traditional sports writer. It was never a goal of mine to be a news breaker, I just like posting my jokes. However in the past couple weeks I have tried several times to update this blog, and my irritation with some of the narratives in Cleveland sports shone through in my writing. I will never post those articles because they are out of character for me. Its not my job to tell people how to feel, and its not my business to try to make people see things my way.\n\nI'm not ready to abandon my blog quite yet, so I've come up with an idea. I would like to create a type of forum here. So I'm inviting everyone to send me questions. Then periodically I will choose several to answer here on my blog.\n\nObviously I would prefer sports questions, but feel free to send me anything you might have. Who knows you might inspire my next meme. Either way if I choose your question you will get a mention on both my blog and Twitter, and probably a dumb answer to boot. Who could ask for more?\n\nSo if you want to contribute please send your questions to @BrownsMemes on Twitter and tag them with #AskBrownsMemes\n\nTuesday, November 4, 2014\n\nThe only thing I know for sure about the 2014 Cleveland Browns is that I know less about the team now than I did before the season began. Never in all of my days of watching this team play have I seen more bizarrely unpredictable play.\n\nBut one thing I know for sure is that they are better than the old Browns teams. But reading many people's narratives of this team you would never believe it. To see the amount of people complaining about the QB situation and digging for negatives is crazy to me. To have five wins at the halfway point of the year is an incredible feeling. So lets go down memory lane, as I stack up games 1-8 head to head against last year's team and lets see if anyone would want to live through last season again instead.\n\nGame One:\n\n2014 Browns 27 - Steelers 30 - The season couldn't have started worse, the team bumbled to a 27-3 halftime deficit. However the Browns came out in the second half like an entirely different team scoring 24 unanswered points to tie the game late in the 4th quarter. However the team ran out of gas at the very end of the game giving up a game winning FG in the last seconds.\n\n2013 Dolphins 23 - Browns 10 - The Browns finally mustered some offense just before half to take a 7-6 halftime lead. That was their highlight as the Browns fell apart and Ryan Tannehill and the Dolphins cruised through the 2nd half outscoring the Browns 17-3 from that point on.\n\nAdvantage: 2014 Game Two:\n\n2014 Saints 24 - Browns 26 - In a game where most experts gave the Browns no chance to even be competitive in their home opener the Browns outplayed the Saints through most of the 1st half. However the Browns missed some opportunities and gave up some late points and still led the game 16-10 at the half. However this week the Saints managed the comeback and took a late lead in the game. Then the unthinkable happened. Brian Hoyer led a clutch drive setting up a Billy Cundiff game winning FG.\n\n2013 Browns 6 - Ravens 14 - Once again the Browns wasted a good defensive effort, only managing 6 points at halftime. The Ravens quickly erased the deficit and added one more TD for good measure. Brandon Weeden was injured in the 4th quarter and Jason Campbell didn't have a chance either. Advantage: 2014 Game Three:\n\n2014 Ravens 23 - Browns 21 - The Browns managed to hang tough with the Ravens, and heading into the 4th quarter held a fragile 21-17 lead. Brian Hoyer hit Taylor Gabriel on 70 yard pass that looked like it was going to setup some insurance. The Browns didn't do another thing right that game. The entire offense and defense fell apart and the same old Browns reared it's ugly head.\n\n2013 Browns 31 - Vikings 27 - After a shocking week Trent Richardson was traded and Brian Hoyer was named starting QB. The next shocker was the fact we had offense for the first time in 2013. In the first exciting game of 2013 the Browns hung tough, but found themselves down by 4 in the 4th quarter. Then the unthinkable happened. Brian Hoyer led a clutch drive finding Jordan Cameron for a game winning touchdown.\n\nAdvantage: 2013\n\nGame Four:\n\n2014 Browns 29 - Titans 28 - The Browns had another first half meltdown in this game, building a 25 point deficit in the 2nd quarter. However the Browns scored 28 unanswered points to end the game completing the largest road comeback victory in NFL history.\n\n2013 Bengals 6 - Browns 17 - In one of the most drama free games in a while the Browns managed to hold an early lead for the entire game. The Browns put this game on ice in the 4th quarter with Hoyer's 2nd TD pass of the game. The Bengals offense didn't have an answer.\n\nAdvantage: 2014 Game Five:\n\n2014 Steelers 10 - Browns 31 - In the biggest win over the Steelers in decades, the Browns beat the Steelers from pillar to post. The only negative in the entire game was the fact that Alex Mack would be lost for the season.\n\n2013 Bills 24 - Browns 37 - Brian Hoyer's season ended during the Browns 2nd offensive series. This opened the door for Brandon Weeden to reclaim his job at QB. Weeden wasn't terrific, but Travis Benjamin was. His punt returns set up several key touchdowns taking the Browns winning streak to three games... but now we have to go forward with Weeden.\n\nAdvantage: 2014 Game Six:\n\n2014 Browns 6 - Jaguars 24 - In one of the biggest momentum killing losses in recent memory, the Browns didn't show up in any aspect of the game. Jacksonville literally had a blowout handed to them in this game.\n\n2013 Lions 31 - Browns 17 - In one of the biggest momentum killing losses in recent memory, the Browns took a 17-7 lead into halftime. After the half the Browns self destructed as the Lions put up 24 unanswered points. The game will probably be best remembered for Brandon Weeden's flipper pass interception in the 4th quarter to seal the game for the Lions.\n\nAdvantage: None, both of these games can burn in hell Game Seven:\n\n2014 Raiders 13 - Browns 23 - This certainly wasn't the prettiest game in the world. But the Browns took advantage of the Raider's mistakes and handily won this game.\n\n2013 Browns 13 - Packers 31 - The Browns traveled to Lambeau Field, and did exactly what everyone expected them to do... get blown out. Weeden was horrible, and lost his job again after this game.\n\nAdvantage: 2014\n\nGame Eight:\n\n2014 Buccaneers 17 - Browns 22 - The Browns running game continued to struggle since the loss of Alex Mack, but the passing game picked them up. Hoyer threw for over 300 yards for the first time this season, and the Browns hung tough and picked up a hard fought fifth win of the season.\n\n2013 Browns 17 - Chiefs 23 - Jason Campbell became the 20th starting QB for the Browns since 1999 at Kansas City. And after not being able to complete the comeback after a 20-3 Chiefs lead, became the 20th QB to take a loss. Advantage: 2014\n\nSo tell me again why people are so upset. I have the 2014 season up 6-1-1 versus the 2013 team. And the only time I picked that team was Hoyer's debut. Let's not forget those 5 wins we have at the halfway point is more than the 2013 team mustered all season long. They won their next game and never won again.\n\nSo calm down people, the most alarming things about this year's team is the offensive and defensive lines. We have some work to do. But sit back and enjoy it for a change.\n\nTuesday, October 14, 2014\n\nI post jokes about Cleveland sports. Not much more, not much less. I cover sports in my own weird way. I caption pictures in the same fashion as you would in a meme generator website. Some are funny, some are not. You guys usually will tell me which is which.\n\nI don't take myself super seriously. While I consider myself a minor member of the sports media, I don't need a press pass to do what do. I'm not trying to change the world. I think I can entertain you without dealing out endless false information to try to get a major scoop, or regurgitating old stats. I cover sports. Covering sports really can be as simple as who scores more points.\n\nThere have been some moments that it hasn't been that simple. Ray Rice and Adrian Peterson were necessary diversions. I think many of us can agree we really don't need to pay to see scumbags like that have the perks of being a professional athlete. And the media did their part to ensure the league held individuals like that accountable.\n\nBut I'm not really going to sing the praises of the media here. It was simply a rare positive byproduct of sports coverage (particularly the NFL) moving so far outside the lines, that it finally ventured behind closed doors. Don 't forget that before Ray Rice the narratives for the NFL were simply Johnny Manziel's personal life, and Michael Sam's sex life. No football playing, but a tabloid inspired trash fest of garbage news.\n\nI quit ESPN when Tim Tebow came into the NFL for this very reason. The only reason that I know that ESPN was obsessed about these issues is because nobody else seemed to have quit them. Every time I read my feed on Twitter somebody is complaining about what ESPN is covering, but they don't quit watching. So if nobody else quits watching I guess I can't expect this ever to change.\n\nFor this very reason I depend on our local reporters for Browns news. I've carried a bit of pity for many of these folks, because how fun has it been to cover this team? I remember when I started this, every joke was so negative. At the time what did I have to celebrate? Someone asked me what I was going to do if the Browns ever were good. I said, \"simple, make fun of the other team.\" I think yesterday was a great example of my evolution. Apparently our jaded local boys were not ready to evolve.\n\nDuring victory Monday, someone had the gall to stick a microphone in Brian Hoyer's face and try to drag some contract drama out of him. They succeeded, and managed to spin his answer into a narrative to him not signing with Cleveland unless Johnny Manziel is gone. Happy birthday Brian. Way to beat the Steelers. Have fun dealing with the media driven backlash this is about to cause.\n\nThe fact is that common sense would say that this sensitive contract situation will not be handled until this offseason. It is the smart way to go. We should wait a full season and see the body of work that Hoyer can put on the field. We should observe how hard Manziel works this season to improve his status and go from there. Not ruin the most joyous day in recent memory by falling into the negative, trashy media hole the rest of the world seems to have fallen in.\n\nSo once again the media stirs the pot, I get it when the going gets tough but this time completely baffles me. This fragile fan base that still has a portion that loves the winning, but can't be satisfied with the personnel we are winning with has a new soapbox to cry from. And frankly it pisses me off.\n\nDoes the joke guy need to step his game up? Because right now some of the media is better at telling jokes than me. The issue is that those guys don't realize they are telling them. Be careful guys, because too much more of this and the jokes will start falling on you...\n\nMonday, October 13, 2014\n\nTo be fair the Browns and Steelers rivalry has never been that good. The Browns dominated the 50's and 60's. But 1970 brought on a new day and the \"Three Rivers Jinx\" took hold for the Browns as they watched the Steelers move on to be a dominate dynasty in the NFL. The mid 80's finally shifted in the Browns favor, and once again they were the better team. Then the mid 90's the rivalry shifted back into the Steelers favor. From there the Browns moved to Baltimore, which for Steelers fans replaced the rivalry with Cleveland. And since the Browns returned to the NFL in 1999 they have failed to recover the passion in the rivalry, making losses to the Steelers a nearly bi-annual tradition for us for the past decade and a half. It has dampened a rivalry that still has passion and fire, but also is marred by the fact that Steelers fans see the Browns games as a guaranteed win.\n\nThat was until 2014. The season series started with the same old vibe. In two quarters of play the Steelers made mincemeat out of a seemingly overwhelmed Browns squad. And after going into the locker room leading the game 27-3, Steelers fans smugly gloated while Browns fans licked their wounds in an all too familiar scene. But that was the moment the \"same old Browns,\" died.\n\nFor all the errors the Browns committed in the first half of that football game, the team came out of the locker room and punched the Steelers straight across the mouth. The team rallied to tie the game in the 4th quarter, and the Steelers only barely escaped with the win on a last second field goal. But instead of leaving with their heads held high, the Steelers were left with a win that felt more like a kiss from their sister.\n\nWhile at least that was progress for the Browns, it wasn't a win but it was something. Knowing we had a rematch just a few weeks away, many of us hoped that maybe the 2nd half of that game was something more than the Browns just catching a Steelers team who had fallen asleep at the wheel.\n\nWhen Pittsburgh unholy football team made it's visit to the shores of Lake Erie there was something that felt different. Excitement for Browns football as reached a level that hasn't been seen since the 80's. Gone were the sections of terrible towels and black jerseys. An army of orange and brown arrived instead to greet the Steelers into town.\n\nAnd we were loud, obnoxious and ready to have a reason to scream. The Browns entered the game with incredible momentum, and it showed as they cruised to a 21-3 halftime lead. In normal situations this would usually be enough to feel very comfortable, but being a Browns fan it is a normal reaction to wonder how things are going to go wrong. But this day was different. The Browns kept the pedal to the medal, and very quickly turned Pittsburgh's hopes of their own comeback into garbage time.\n\nThe Browns 31-10 rout of the Steelers was a showcase. A four quarter display of a new look Cleveland Browns team that is crawling out of the large shadows cast upon them by the other teams in the division. A team that Cleveland can finally be proud of. So for that I will spare you the same old recycled analysis you can get anywhere, and just celebrate with the rest of you. Enjoy...\n\nTuesday, October 7, 2014\n\nIt was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the first four games of the 2014 Cleveland Browns season. And yes this team is insanely bipolar, unpredictable and crazy to watch. There is a theory that this team could very easily be 4-0 right now, but the same theory applies to the fact that this team could very easily be 0-4 right now. They probably should be 2-2 right now, but the thing is they haven't won both games they probably should have won, but didn't lose both games they should have lost.\n\nTwice this team has completed the largest comeback in team history. They are 1-1 in those games. They completed a 70 yard bomb to all but seal the Ravens games, and literally didn't do one single thing right for the rest of the game to ensure a loss.\n\nWhen this team is good it is great. When this team is bad it is unpalatable. At times the \"same old Browns\" show their ugly faces, Yet the offense isn't the problem, which is new for the Browns. The defense is a huge problem, which wasn't supposed to be the case.\n\nYes it is very hard to deny that Brian Hoyer has finally managed to make believers out of many people. Hoyer has a 6-1 TD to INT ratio and has a higher QBR than Brady, Brees, Flacco, and Stafford. While there is still the painfully biased Johnny Manziel faithful still calling for Hoyer's benching, the consensus finally has agreed to stay the course with Hoyer for the foreseeable future.\n\nWhile Hoyer hasn't been perfect, he has done a fine job of making his receivers better, not the other way around. He isn't leaning on any one guy. Miles Austin and Andrew Hawkins have been very solid, but many of the biggest plays have been left for guys like Taylor Gabriel and Travis Benjamin.\nBut the real strength has been the fine core of running backs that the Browns amassed this offseason. Gone are the days of watching a back smack into a rear end of an offensive lineman for a minimal gain. This team can run, and run well.\n\nCall them what you will the running backs have been awesome. Ben Tate ripped off a huge run in the opener and got injured. All that did was show us that we have two more awesome running backs in Terrance West and Isaiah Crowell. Each guy is just different enough from one another that it has made for a tremendous opportunity to rotate and keep our running game fresh all game long.\n\nSo what is the catch? Yes it is Browns football so there has to be a catch right? The catch comes in the 31st ranked defense. Yes the vaunted \"wait until you see what these guys can do\" defense that came with into town with Mike Pettine has been awful.\n\nEach game has came and gone with large chunks of games exhibiting some of the poorest tackling you can hope for. Running backs flow through our front seven like water passing through a strainer. Receivers routinely run wide open through our secondary. Our defense is a big play factory. Their 6.1 yards allowed per play is tied for the worst in the league.\n\nSo no I can't tell you what to expect for the rest of this season. I am not even going to embarrass myself with a guess. If the defense improves we have a good chance. If the offense stalls we are probably screwed. It is as simple as that, now hopefully the games will be less stressful.", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "b6ddd024-057f-47d8-9548-6e4bcfb36332", "url": "http://clevelandsportsmemes.blogspot.com/2014/"}

Photo by Tom McCarthy\n\n\"I don't know what to say other than wow,\" McBride said, still in shock after running the rapid speed. \"I could tell it was faster than I had ever been. Everything around me seemed to be moving so much faster.\"\n\nThe weekend was not without its share of adversity for the Spiderman.\n\nOn Saturday it was Wills who scored first with a 5.90 run in qualifying to secure the pole position.

His crew worked late into the night to make changes for Sunday.\n\nThe crew of Larry McBride – Steve McBride, Chuck Stuart and Roland Stuart working hard to make changes for race day.\n\n\"We were struggling a bit with a new tune-up and some high track temps,\" McBride said. \"My team did a great job sorting it all out.\"\n\nOn Sunday McBride lined up with longtime friend and rival Chris Hand. McBride and Hand produced the ManCup's first ever side-by-side five second pass, only the third in the history of the sport, with Hand running a 5.88 to McBride's 5.95.

The hike can take from one to three hours round trip depending on how many waterfalls you want to see. If you are lucky you may spot sloths, monkeys, quetzals or any number of the fascinating wildlife living in the cloudforest.\n\nThe Lost Waterfalls hike exceeded expectations, but it seems very obscure for no good reason. The water is beautiful. The forest is dense with flowers and vines. The views are great. It's a good alternative to the Volcun Baru National Park.\n\nThis is a hike through the rain forest that follows a small river up the mountain cascading in 3 waterfalls. The hike originates in the Bojo Mona region, north of Boquete. It is on private property and there is $5 per person charge. I don't know what their hours are but a person was present midday to accept our money. More about this below.\n\nThis hike is up a mountain and it's hard. This is not something to do in the dark or poor weather. Bring water and camera but not too much to carry. You could picnic but be prepared to carry everything in and out. There was pleasantly no litter (unlike the rest of Panama) and very small amounts or tree/rock graffiti. One regret was that we didn't see any birds or wildlife to speak of. Maybe you have to go early morning for that.\n\nInitially, we only saw this on Trip Advisor and thought it would be easy to find details on the internet. That is not the case. The Boquete vistors center was no help either. They seem to encourage gringos to take a tour for $50+ per person and learning only via your guide. I'm sure that's great but we really wanted to do this ourselves.\n\nWe drove north out of Boquete on Main Street. Took the right fork out of town and followed this single-lane two-way road (slowly for about 4 km) until we saw a sign for 3 Lost Waterfalls with a right arrow and 1.2 km distance indicated. We parked thinking it was pointing to a driveway, but this is a shared access road for several farms (Fincas). You can drive this 1.2 km distance to another small sign at a gravel path to walk through some private property. There was a canopy tour sign on the way to the hiking path and We eventually crossed a small suspension bridge followed by a climb up to a bluff (approx 1 km total). This was pretty steep but only an introduction to the path and still not in the forest. At the top of the bluff is a brand new cabin, outhourse and not-so-new concession stand. This is where you pay and get a brief Spanish and English description of the hike plus a view of a hand sketched map.\n\nThe waterfalls are somewhat equal distance apart and with their own challenges, but generally each is a little harder to climb. If you are visiting all three, you are advised to skip the first waterfall and proceed to the second, catching the first on your way back by taking a shortcut (but very steep) climb down from higher on the path. Generally the path is obvious with either primitive handrails, cut steps, roots, stone steps or even a few ropes. The three waterfalls are similar but distinct. The second and third falls are accessible to stand under or very near with the second hosting a small cave that we didn't enter past one step. The first fall has a few benches made from tree trunks for resting. The falls are 15 to 30 minutes apart but seemed to require a 15 minute break at each just to catch our breath. Budget 2 hours plus 20 minutes each way back to your car with appropriate hiking energy for the return.\n\nEnjoy.\n\n>\n\nAsk Mike20140118 about The Lost Waterfalls-Boquete\n\n1 Thank Mike20140118\n\nThis review is the subjective opinion of a TripAdvisor member and not of TripAdvisor LLC.\n\nWe are avid walkers and occasional hiker. We go for walks of 10 – 12 KM at least once a week summer and winter. For those Canadians familiar with Algonquin Park, we have hiked I believe every trail. When we read the reviews about the Lost Waterfalls we got the impression that reaching the first two waterfalls as a relatively easy hike. We reach both the first and second waterfall and after talking to some younger people, ho mentioned ropes to get down to the third waterfall we, decided against attempting the third waterfalls. We found the hikes to be certainly doable by anyone in reasonably good shape however the hike is fairly strenuous. Going there it is mostly uphill with some very steep portions. To reach the first two waterfalls, from where you leave the road will be a couple of hours. Also even though the altitude provides some temperature relief it is still in the mid 20's and with the humidity in the low 30's. So bring water! The hike is well worth doing, but we just to pass along that it is not a walk in the park. For an easier hike, which is very scenic you can try Finca Lerida.\n\nAsk OntarioHappycamper about The Lost Waterfalls-Boquete\n\nThank OntarioHappycamper\n\nThis review is the subjective opinion of a TripAdvisor member and not of TripAdvisor LLC.\n\nI'm sure I chose this outing because it was listed as a nature walk. Our guide was delightful and took our little group of 4 for a scenic drive to the beginning of this 'walk.' It was a very steep, slippery, uphill hike with poor, rickety railings for support. I was getting cranky and especially when Christian told us we had much more of the same to reach even the FIRST of three waterfalls. We arrived at a clearing where the tour guide paid $5 each on our behalf to cross into the native lands. I chose to stay at the clearing and wandered around the adorable little mountain cabin which is available for rent. The terrain was so steep even at this clearing that I had to be very careful of my footing just walking around taking pictures of flowers, scenery and birds. The scenery was beautiful. We were in the \"Cloud Forest\" and it was very damp and the sky was dull. Going down was easier than the ascent, but still required attention to where you step next. The other couple with us, and Christian, were all very tolerant of my age and speed. This 'walk' needs to be more clearly described. While I was sitting in the clearing on a cute little bench, a woman my age was lagging behind her daughter and looking as if she were in trouble. I told her that I had quit...she said she 'couldn't' and looked ahead to her daughter. It is definitely a 'walk' for the very fit...and not much to see at the end to make it worthwhile.\n\nAsk freddie43Kenora about The Lost Waterfalls-Boquete\n\nThank freddie43Kenora\n\nThis review is the subjective opinion of a TripAdvisor member and not of TripAdvisor LLC.\n\nburtondogs, Owner at The Lost Waterfalls-Boquete, responded to this reviewResponded May 25, 2014\n\nI'm so sorry that you did not have a better day going to The Lost Waterfalls. We pride ourselves on our hike into the cloudforest. and almost everyone loves it. In fact, we have only had 2 negative reviews since we have been on tripadvisor. The first reviewer complained about the $5 entrance fee and then I read yours. I have to say that I don't think that your review was very fair. You stated that The Lost Waterfalls is listed as an easy walk when that is just not the case. It is listed on the website as a strenuous and sometimes difficult hike, not a walk. It is also listed on Trip Advisor above as a moderate to difficult hike.. As far as I know, it is not listed anywhere as an easy walk. There are also potos and videos showing the hike on Facebook. I know that you went on a guided tour with Christian, who is a very nice person, but , as a guide, it is his responsibilty to talk to you before the hike and explain to you the degree of difficulty and to ascertain whether or not you are up to it. I noticed on another of your reviews that you are 71 years old and that should have given Christian even more reason to ask you about your previous hiking experience. We get every age hiker, but they have to be used to hiking. I also thought that it was unfair to give us a por rating when you didn't even see any of the waterfalls. There is another hike fairly close to The Lost Waterfalls that has a waterfall and offers a much easier hike to get to it. Perhaps you mixed them up.

Recommend taking binoculars to spot the much-sought-after quetzal which many other hikers were lucky enough to see. Though we didn't see any of the birds, the trees made up for it. The trail winds up to a lovely stand of old-growth cloud forest and a pretty waterfall to boot.

I firmly believe that Americans must have some degree of parity of arms with government forces. The AR-15 and other so-called \"assault rifles\" (which I've blogged about) are required to maintain that parity. If you have any doubts, you need only study the history of Afghanistan and present events in Syria to realize that the \"people\" do not necessarily need tanks or fighter planes, but they do need rifles. A group of motivated riflemen can, at least by today's standards of military technology, overcome a superior armed force. There is absolutely no historical precedent for Jews to not eventually become the targets of first discrimination, and ultimately physical abuse and murder.\n\nSo in that vein, Jewish political commentator, radio talk show host, and attorney Ben Shapiro recently confronted one of the most vile human beings on American soil, Piers Morgan, and did rather well:", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "6dfde96e-9c2c-4ef9-9bd1-35d76acb4a81", "url": "http://jewishmarksmanship.org/category/ben-shapiro/"}

Don't worry about it.\n\nWhat do you mean by that. Is she going to file green card in future?She did not say that. May be she wants to go back to her native country once H1 expires.Am I right? H1 visa are given to stay here temporarily for 6 years not to get green cards.First husbands get green cardsm then spouses get green cards, then their parents and in-laws get green cards. This is why lot of primary H1 people are stuck in the line for past 8-9 years without promotions,salary hikes,buying homes. When there are no job for primary H1s, don't understand why spouses want to work.That's why lot of folks are going back to their native places.Competition wihtin out guys.Its like siblings fighting for same job in a single family.\n\nWell, there is no requirement from USCIS that forces companies to revoke 140 after employees leave or get laid off from the company. Its more to do with ability to pay issue. When a company receives a ability to pay rfe, it needs to show all the financial records along with how many 140s have been applied by them. USCIS checks the financial docs and number of 140s (underline wages) to make sure that company can pay wages. Most of the time, small time consulting companies get A2P rfe so mostly they revoke the 140s but in this economy, we can't be sure about big companies too.\n\n2010 tattoo i miss you i love\n\nhemya\n\n02-12 02:25 PM\n\nPlease ask your lawyer whether the H1 is being filed as \" change of status\" or \"consular processing\". If it is consular processing then she will have to go and get the stamping done. As per my knowledge if H1 is rejected she can still enter on H4 since it is still valid. I assume the H1 petition will be filed on 1st April. If she enters after that date then most probably it will have to be consular processing\n\nHowever please check with your lawyer since the above is only my understanding\n\nMy\n\nThe\n\nIs this true? any ideas?\n\nGiven the situation for 485 denial. AFAIK, You have an option of filing for H1B (not counted against quota) based on your B's labor approval and pending 140. Once you use the EAD, technically you don't have the H1B status to transfer or extend. Hence, it will require you to go to consulate (b/c approval will come without I94) to stamp, and start working for Company B after you return.\n\n2010 I miss you. Night xxx\n\nand hubby is still pushing\n\ndeecha\n\n08-18 02:23 PM\n\nHi I was not so so keen until this matter was resolved..BUT my GC got approved. I am separated from spouse. But when I filed 485, I was \"married\" because our relationship was still unstable. Now QUITE FRANKLY I am NOT sure what's going to happen ahead.Dont ask me why. This whole uncertainty depressed me . If I re-unite and my wife is in India and I am on GC HOW do I call her here ? If I divorce and re-marry how do I get my new wife here. In any case , I dont plan on getting more than 1 person so pl dont look at it from a gamers view. Thanks for ur help RR\n\nIt's not my intention to encourage marital discord. Having said that there are a couple options for you:\n\n(a) If you re-unite and reconcile with your wife, you can file a follow-to-join petition, since you were married before you got your GC. She will get her GC fairly fast and be able to enter as an immigrant.\n\n(b) If you get divorced and get re-married, you're out of luck. You would have to file a Family based I-140 petition (F2A, I think) and it takes about 5-6 years to get something like that approved. In the meantime if you want her to come to the USA, she will have to come on a dual-intent visa such as H1B. The consulate will not give her an ordinary visa. Of course, you can claim citizenship and \"upgrade\" your petition.\n\nI am not a lawyer and this not legal advice. Please consult an attorney for your specific case.\n\nCertainly not all hospitals and universities must most do fall in the non-profit category.\n\nCheck with the HR of that org. to confirm.\n\nyes of course All US universities and Hospitals are non-cap the pay is less but jobs is more stable and the university will file the visa paperwork(no lawyers fees)\n\nchanging to cap-subject requires a regular oct-dependent h1b visa again\n\nhair And I lie awake and miss you\n\nI miss you.\n\nsnathan\n\n02-23 06:59 PM\n\nI have a B.E in Electronics (4 years) and an PGDM in IT (2 years) from India but my I140 is denied on the basis that my PGDM School in India would accept 3 years undergrad and thus the education is not equivalent to M.S in US. I did send the educational evaluation along with I140 but the decision was made on the descretion on CIS.\n\nPlease advice if I should refile with education evaluation from anothe agency.\n\nIts all depends on what you have in the PERM requirement. It shouldn't be an issue when you have an B.E - 4 years. But the USCIS says the PGDM accepts 3 years bachelor also and I am not sure how that's matter for your individual case. Talk to a competent attorney.\n\nSilicon Valley Immigration Lawyer Blog Has Just Posted the Following: An earlier blog post \"Silicon Valley Employers Need to Prepare for Surprise USCIS Visits\" ( described the \"new normal\" of USCIS employees or contractors showing up unexpectedly and inquiring about past visa petitions and foreign national workers.

{"text": "Vaginal Rejuvenation\n\nvaginal rejuvention CLEVELAND, OHIO\n\nTHERMIVA AND GENEVEVE\n\nWhat Is Vaginal rejuvenation and what procedure is right for you?\n\nAt Advanced Skin Renewal we are happy to offer two treatment options for Vaginal Rejuvenation and Feminine Wellness! ThermiVa and The Geneveve.\n\nAM I A CANDIDATE FOR VAGINAL REJUVENATION?\n\n• Do you feel dry during intercourse?\n\n• Do you have trouble reaching orgasm?\n\n• Do you ever leak urine when you cough, sneeze or exercise?\n\n• Do you feel 'loose' vaginally since childbirth and/or menopause?\n\n• Have you ever not made it to the bathroom on time?\n\n• Have your intimate relationships suffered due to vaginal changes?\n\n• Are you experiencing a loss of self-confidence, interest in sex or lack of sexual desire due to changes in your feminine wellness?\n\nIf you answered YES to any of those questions, non-surgical vaginal rejuvenation might be the answer.\n\nThe best way to find out if you could benefit from Geneveve or ThermiVa is to schedule a complimentary consultation with Dr. Haynesworth and Genevieve George; they work closely with their patients to make sure that the treatment is the best fit for the individual patients and their concerns.\n\nWhat is Geneveve?\n\nGeneveve is a unique treatment that generates healthy collagen and a renewed feeling of feminine wellness. The dual-mode Geneveve treatment cools and protects the surface while heating deeper tissue. Because Geneveve uses tiny pulses of gentle energy, the right amount of heat — for the right time — is delivered to reinvigorate tissue. Patients notice a significant improvement in stress urinary incontinence, vaginal laxity, and sexual health, self-confidence! In ONE treatment.\n\nWhat You Can Expect\n\nYou have made the right choice and decided to take a step toward feminine wellness. Patients can expect to have a consultation with our friendly staff who will explain the procedure in detail.\n\nUpon making the informed decision to have the treatment done, you will schedule the procedure.\n\nIt is vital that we clear you for your vaginal rejuvenation, reconstruction and tightening treatment. Every Patient considering a vaginal rejuvenation treatment will have an evaluation. Although Geneveve is a non-surgical procedure, there can be risks involved. An evaluation is necessary to ensure the health of the patient. Assessments can be done during your initial consultation or at a separate appointment.\n\nThe day of the procedure patients only requires one, 30-minute Geneveve procedure. Treatments are completely painless and require no anesthesia or pain management. There is no downtime following a Geneveve procedure and patients may resume regular activities including sexual activity the same day as treatment.\n\nIn many cases, patients seek additional Geneveve therapies one time per year to maintain results.\n\nWhat is ThermiVa?\n\nAdvanced Skin Renewal also offers ThermiVa.\n\nThermiva is a radio frequency machine, with no downtime.\n\nIt requires a series of 3 (three) treatments.\n\nOnce a month for three months.\n\nThermiVa is a form of energy medicine that uses radio frequency heat therapy to promote collagen synthesis, resulting in shrinkage and tightening of female tissues. ThermiVa is a non-surgical, non-invasive, pain-free smart alternative to more invasive surgical procedures.\n\nHOW DOES THERMIVA WORK?\n\nThermiVa is an in-office, non-surgical procedure that uses radio frequency energy to gently heat tissue through an \"S\" shaped hand piece. Heat and energy shrink skin and tightens external and internal vulvovaginal tissue. The hand piece features disposable applicator with gentle curves to provide comfort. No downtime is necessary. The new tissue will be tighter and younger looking due to new collagen growth and thicker skin resulting from the application of radio frequency to the area.\n\nWhat causes the female tissue to change?\n\nChildbirth, weight changes, age and certain medical conditions can stretch the muscles of the vagina and surrounding tissues, causing them to lose elasticity.\n\nWhy Vaginal Rejuvenation?\n\nWomen choose vaginal rejuvenation treatments for a variety of reasons including incontinence, vaginal tightening and improving sensation and sexual pleasure. Some women suffer from incontinence, orgasm dysfunction, prolapse, vaginal laxity, and/or vaginal dryness as a result of childbirth or a change in hormone status. Our goal is to empower women to take back control.\n\nOur patients seek and want an intelligent choice for their female needs; a decision that is easy to handle has no recovery time and provides results almost immediately.\n\nSTUDIES SHOW THAT THE USE OF NON-SURGICAL VAGINAL REJUVENATION TREATMENTS LEADS TO IMPROVEMENTS IN:\n\n• Labial Cosmetic Appearance: Radio-frequency stimulates collagen and tightens tissues resulting in a reduction of laxity and a tightening of the skin. Skin becomes smoother and softer, and women are more comfortable in tight clothing such as bikinis and leotards.\n\n• Vaginal Canal Tightening: radio-frequency energy also directly causes tightening of collagen at the treatment areas, tightening the internal canal, so it is noticeable to the patient and their partner.\n\n• Improves Dryness/Atrophic Vaginitis: Increases moisture, reducing irritation, and increasing comfort (before, during and after intimacy) without the use of hormone therapies. The radio-frequency energy stimulates the release of neuropeptides, improving circulation and blood flow resulting in improved moisture and lubrication.\n\n• Enhanced Intimate Function: Treatments enhance sensory nerve function resulting in more coordinated and stronger muscular contractions and the capability to achieve orgasms in a\n\nshorter period. Non-Surgical treatments for the clitoral and \"g-spot\" areas are very safe.\n\nImproves Pelvic Prolapse: The treatment shrinks and helps to improve muscle coordination and strength. The vulva-vaginal tissue tightens during treatments resulting in a tightening or pulling in of the prolapse organs. Research is showing an improvement in prolapse by as much as one grade reduction after ThermiVa therapy.\n\nIS ANESTHETIC USED OR NEEDED?\n\nNo anesthesia is needed, and there is no downtime required after the treatments.\n\nIS IT SAFE?\n\nNon-Surgical Vaginal Rejuvenation is being used all over the world to enhance feminine wellness. It continues to prove to be an efficient non-surgical way of reversing the signs of age.\n\nWHAT IS THE COST OF VAGINAL REJUVENATION?\n\nAt Advanced Skin Renewal, we try to pass any cost saving on to you. We offer some Flash-Sales and Specials throughout the year.\n\nThe best way to find out about these specials is to follow us on Instagram and sign up for our emails!\n\nPrices for Vaginal Rejuventation start at $3,000.0\n\nThe calendar is starting to fill up, Call Advanced Skin Renewal TODAY at: (216)-509-6345 to set up a free consultation.", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "f0df647c-1128-4d7d-b2a0-027c24078ac8", "url": "http://www.advancedskinrenewal.com/vaginal-rejuvenation-cleveland-ohio"}

It may be too early to tell, but it looks like 2010 cycle will mark the year of Alan Grayson. It's still only 2009 but Blue America has already raised over $30,000 for him-- without having even made an official endorsement! We've been collecting contributions for him at No Means No, a page dedicated to members of Congress who voted against Obama's supplemental war budget in June, and at Getting Grayson's Back, a page dedicated to standing up for him when he got GOP noses out of joint by telling the truth about their health care obstructionism.\n\nToday Blue America is joining a netroots money bomb effort on behalf of Grayson, urging our community to band together and answer the Inside-the-Beltway and Villager mentality that says there's no room for a plainspoken truth-teller like Grayson in Congress. Nevermind, they tell you, that he studied economics at Harvard, then worked as an economist, then studied law at Harvard and then successfully pursued war profiteers and Bush cronies in Iraq-- even before being elected to Congress in a Republican district and becoming the scourge of banksters and assorted evil-doers dragged before the House Financial Services committee. No, to the Villagers, he's all about \"outlandish rhetoric;\" he's \"the left's Michele Bachmann;\" he's \"pugilistic\" and a \"wing nut.\"\n\nRep. Grayson joins us below in the comments section where you can see for yourself he's quickly become the favorite member of Congress of Democrats and independents from across the country. And please, help out with the money bomb today.", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "c1604917-519f-4dd5-92e0-a6f01c57a9f2", "url": "http://blueamerica.crooksandliars.com/tags/challenger"}

{"text": "This event was skipped from the running calender last year for no apparent reason.With the new state administrative,the Majlis Perbandaran Klang organised this race with a new running route.Unlike the previous one including stair climbing at the old Jambatan Kota and the killer hill behind the Dewan Hamzah,the new route is relatively flat for both the 10k and 7k and it is far from challenging compared to the previous route.\n\nThe race started from Padang Sultan Sulaiman towards Jalan Tengku Diauddin and a left turning to Jalan Tengku Kelana (also known as Indian Street for its popular Indian shops and restaurants especially during the festive seasons) and all the way to the Simpang Lima roundabout before the Persiaran Raja Muda Musa.As for the 7k,runners took a detour at the Taman Gembira/Taman Chi Liung interchange and for the 10k,the detour was at Pandamaran Kompleks Sukan/Port Garden before heading back to the stadium.The only challenging stretch of the course is at Jalan Istana.\n\nThere are two resemblances to the Adidas King of The Road race held last year at the New Pantai Expressway.First the highway was closed to traffic,so runners need not have to worry about the safety and can fully concentrate on their run.Even the SAAA officer joked if a car or a motorcycle is in your path,you are probably running out of the designated route.Well done to the organizer.Secondly the straight highway create boredom for slow runners.It seems like a never ending run.Luckily it was just a short race.\n\nConsidering 'home ground' for the Klangite,many signed up to support this event.Besides members from the KPAC and Klang's Pacesetters group,the local schools also sent their students to participate in this event to make it even more merrier.The fine cool Sunday morning attracted many visitors to the stadium as well.The overall turned up were good and l must say this event successfully attracted many good runners from other states too.\n\nIt was a very competitive race especially in the men open category according to a friend of mine.Top guns like Arul Thevar,Shaharudin,Venul gopal, Samuel Moses and KPAC heroes - Vigneswaran,Jayakumar and Jenken were among those eyeing for the top position.The top 20 position in each categories receive cash and hampers as prizes. Surprisingly there were no Kenyan in sight,maybe they were prohibited from taking part.\n\nCompared to the previous race they organised,the organizer decided to trim down the number of medals offered.Instead of 300 medals in the open categories and 150 in the veteran,this time the medals offered were 100 and 50 respectitively.\n\nA group photo of friends and KPAC members.\n\nStudents made up part of the participants.\n\nL to R:Ahmad Jamil,Mazlan,Badrul Nizam and Syanizam.\n\nCompo MPK entertaining the crowd.\n\nLots of hampers were up for grabs for race and lucky draw winners.\n\nSAAA officials waiting patiently for slow runners to wrap up the race.\n\nDummies exhibiting the vests for the on-coming Adidas King of The Road race.\n\nWe, the KPAC would like to take this opportunity to thank Mr Peter Quah-the Township Manager of Harum Intisari Sdn Bhd for granting us permission to organise our breakfast run at the Botanic Lake.In his approval letter to KPAC recently,he agreed to our intention of promoting a healthy running.\n\nIt was a wet,wet Sunday morning for this breakfast run.Rain did not stop as it drizzled as early as 5.00 am.The turnout was not encouraging,understandably the rain dampened the spirit of a good family outing.There were about 40 runners turned up.As for some serious one,the drizzling did not stop them.Our president and some hardcore runners braved the rain to run 4 laps of 5.5km.\n\nBy 7.30 am more and more members turned up for some shorter runs and enjoy the beautiful sceneries of this Botanic Garden.Later breakfast was served.Fried noodle,vermicelli (mihun),nasi lemak,curry chicken,yam cake,porridge,red bean soup and fruits were prepared for members at no cost.\n\nThe committee has not decided yet when and where will the next breakfast run to be held.Hopefully the attendance will improve in the future.\n\nThe group photograph at Bandar Botanic\n\nMembers were enjoying their breakfast after a wet run!\n\nL to R:Kamaruzaman,Syanizam and who is this? Yap Chin Huat-downed with injuries and now slowly recovering,soon he will make an impact in the local running circuit especially in the junior veteran category\n\nTaman Metropolitan,Kepong,KL I must thank Mr Ronnie See-the captain of the Pacemakers Network- for inviting us to participate in this team relay run.I was told a team pulled out of the competition at 11th hour and Mr Ronnie seek our cooperation to send one to represent the club.\n\nThere were 27 teams took part in this relay race and our team was rated as one of the favorite because our runners are among the best in the local running community.\n\nOur quartet of Thalagavathy as first runner,Vigneswaran,Ng Swee Yee and Jayakumar rocked the PAR4 ' kau kau lat ' as we emerged champion, defeated the defending champion-Der Klang Runners into second place.The race was flagged off by Tan Sri Rohaizad with the ladies to run first.\n\nDer Klang Runners was the first team to change baton as their first lady runner,Ms Mitchele managed to build a large gap between the runners.Our Thalagavathy was lying in the 4th position and by the time baton changed hand, our second runner,Vigneswaran was 200m behind Murali,the leader and two other runners.He managed to close the gap with his excellent run with a timing of 11m 06s (l believe this was the fastest ever clocked by a runner this morning) in this 3.35 km circuit.He overtook two runners only to trail the leader by a mere 50m.\n\nWhen baton changed hand again for the third runner,Ng Swee Yee was very excited.In front of him was Gunaseelan ,another good runner from the Pacemakers Network but our friend confidently challenge and overtook him at the 2.5km mark and now the KPAC leads.Swee Yee's strong finish enable our fourth and final runner,Jayakumar to further widen the gap and ran home unchallenged by the closest rival by more than 2 minutes.\n\nEventhough this was just a simple race organised by the Pacemakers,no champion's trophies were offered and only finisher medals but good co-ordination and cooperations between the volunteers themselves proved that it was a successful event.The KPAC will definitely take part if invited again next year.\n\nKuantan,Pahang First the KPAC 'contingent' to this beautiful race would like to thank Ms Crystal and Mr Tan Wah Seng-the group leader of Kuantan Pacesetters- for assisting us to collect our T shirt and running bib and also arrangement of accommodation as well.Our group consists of 2 female and 11 male runners lead by our president Mr Wong Soon Pin.\n\nOn this 16km race day,the weather was so kind to us.We thought there would be a downpour as thunders were heard growling in the sky.The participation was encouraging probably because of hefty cash rewards offered and we were gunned off batch by batch.The first to go was the Men's International open category,felt a little pity for our poor friend,Dhan Bahadur who is a junior veteran to compete with those young Kenyan running machines.\n\nNext was the Men's National open category which saw stiff competition among the local runners-among them were Venul Gopal,Muniandy,Saharudin,Arul Thevar,Samuel Moses and of course our hero Vigneswaran.\n\nWe ran the first 2 km on the tarmac road all the way to Teluk Cempedak,and then on a narrow wooden bridge which is built parallel to the beach for short distance,then a 200 m hill before the agony of running on the beach begun.Thick fine and soft sand makes the legs heavy as for most of us this was the first ever experience.\n\nFor the next 3 km,most runners were shy of the sea water as the tiny waves hit the seaside,runners were seen avoiding so not to get their running shoe wet.There were several check points to ensure runners run on the designated route.There were 3 water stations and what l like about them was they served ice cool isotonic drink and it was really refreshing.\n\nAt approximately 7 km mark,there was a stream and runners were required to hop on a 3 piece metal plank tight together to plastic drums act as float.The 'bridge' was swaying unsteadily to the left and right and we had to jump into the shallow stream to cross over.There was another stream,l guess it was 2 km away but it was not as broad as the previous one.\n\nThe rest of the run it was sandy beaches,windy and cool breeze air and the best part is you can see the finishing line with white canopies erected at Baluk from a far distance away.\n\nAs far as KPAC members are concerned,this Kuantan Beach Run is a gold pot to most of them.10 out of 13 runners won cash rewards.The biggest winners were Nur Athika and Lim Pei Yen who came first and second in the H category (Women's junior) and they entitled to cash rewards of RM1,000 and RM800.00 respectively.Vigneswaran 10th place position won him RM300.00,Thalagavathy's 7th position in the D category made her richer by RM300.00 too and Dhan Bahadur 19th placing in the International group earned him RM200.00.\n\nIn conclusion the race was an enjoyable one and we KPAC members participated in this run really have fun and hope the Majlis Perbandaran Kuantan will organise again next year.", "language": "eng",

{"text": "David King is one of the great but relatively unacknowledged UK editorial designers. Developing his talent alongside Michael Rand at The Sunday Times during the late sixties, his interest in Russian constructivism art and design led him to become the designer of choice for the groups behind the rise in left wing activism in late seventies Britain. City Limits magazine was one such project, a listings title that grew out of a bitter internal rift within the more established Time Out.\n\nMaking a virtue of a poor budget, King's covers for the new magazine (launch issue above) were based on bold, grotesque typography, strong CMYK colours and coarse halftones. They remain a case study in editorial branding and were one of the main reasons I was drawn to magazine design. (later, my first editorial job was in the City Limits studio). See more of David King's covers here.\n\nWired also has a highly developed visual identity, and hasn't been scared to run typographically led covers over the years. This one, suggested by Warren, is from April 1999 and is almost invisibly black. 'The headlines are printed in clear gloss varnish on matt black. At the time it exuded extreme confidence on what was still really a niche publication.'\n\nSleazenation – an earlier incarnation of Sleaze magazine – produced a run of great covers under art director Scott King. This one, from November 2001, takes a cheesy T-shirt joke and adapts it the newsstand shelf. King has the enviable ability to carry off a simple idea like this by making the design invisible.

And it's a nice break from the relentless political news that fortunately deserves to be covered but a break from is always good too.\n\nThe Adams Homestead and Nature Preserve is always fun to attend as its outbuildings are open to explore and their are carolers and activities for kids and adults to enjoy.\n\nI personally like Christmas. The holiday and its sentimental depiction. When I lived in northern California and got the chance I would go into San Francisco to enjoy the ostentatious window displays that the large stores would put up. These days I enjoy a simpler look at Christmas decorations.\n\nSometimes while out shooting I just enjoy looking at light. And depending on what it falls on creates something that might be worth photographing. One such outing in Siouxland was at the Adams Homestead and Nature Preserve in North Sioux City, SD. I like the Adams Homestead. There are hiking trails that take you to the Missouri River, through a stand of cottonwood trees that have been standing for almost a century and to the homestead itself. The Homestead area over time has taken on a more park-like atmosphere which is nice but lacks its earlier charm of rustic chaos which I enjoyed photographing. But there is barn there still standing that I always visit and have photographed countless times with the look changing through the seasons and time of day and with and without much sunshine. I sometimes wonder if this is how artist Claude Monet felt when he visited the Giverny garden in France. While there is no comparison between my photographs and his paintings, it the continual visitation to a place to look, see and maybe record something not seen and seen many times. A thing of beauty is in the eye of the beholder.\n\nWith the 10 inches of recent snowfall shoveled off my sidewalks and temperatures predicted for Siouxland to hit the 40's it's hard not to be dreaming of blue skies and warm sunshine to hit one's face and make you smile. Spring is coming. I keep saying that maybe more to give me hope although this hasn't been a bad winter. But recent days of 60 degree weather sure can spoil a person and wish for spring to come a little sooner.\n\nWinter is a season that has its cloudy grey days as well as the sunshine days. In the winter the clouds usually help keep the temps a little higher than a clear blue sky day or evening sky. Shooting during overcast days during the winter season with brown tones and grey tones is not always that appealing, and so that might be a time to shoot in B&W. The Fuji cameras I am currently using allow the option. Previously when shooting Canon I could shoot in a monochrome setting or convert my images once in Photoshop. But Fuji, ever the purveyor of film emulsions and now simulations, allows one to shoot in B&W, make some adjustments and use a \"red\" filter, \"green\" filter or a \"yellow\" filter. Having cut my teeth on B&W and experimented with the 25 red and 15 yellow filters, I was game. There are times even in other seasons when B&W can be appropriate.\n\nA visit to the Adams Homestead and Nature Preserve in Siouxland in January was an overcast day, with a fairly decent temperature for walking about and seeing what was there. And it never hurts to either try something different, or experiment a little if its been a while. It's just nice to be outside and enjoying nature.\n\nNo matter what time of year, I always like stopping by the Adams Homestead and Nature Preserve. Walking through the homestead area this last time I visited I saw some new signage both for directions and for information giving some historical perspective about the family that lived there and preserved this area for its fellow residents of Siouxland. Plus with year round residents it now has (four-legged critters), it is fun to see them and the joy they bring to visitors.\n\nThe annual Christmas celebrations for various communities and places are kicking in and it's difficult to get to them all, or then one hears about one you hope to get to next year. Late November the Adams Homestead and Nature Preserve celebrated its annual Christmas event. The ground's buildings are open and decorated. In the church people are caroling, and children can create decorations to take home and hang on their tree in the schoolhouse on the grounds. I took my Lifelong Learning Photo Safari class from the local community college there for an outing. Knowing there was something for every photographer in the group. Buildings, nature, people, artifacts. Something that might appeal to some aspect of what they like to photograph. Even though I try to encourage them to broaden their experience and sometimes pushing them to go outside their comfort zone for the experience. One never knows what might light a fire of interest if there is no exploration.\n\nToday in the Siouxland area it was another spring-like day, with the temperature reaching near 60 degrees fahrenheit. But in a couple of days, the temperatures will plunge stopping somewhere in the 30's with the possibility of more snow. A couple of weeks ago Mother Nature teased Siouxland with warm temperatures and I took advantage of that day to go for a walk in the Adams Homestead and Nature Preserve just across the state line in North Sioux City, South Dakota. The ground was still frozen then with just melted snow forming large puddles. The homestead area of the preserve is a fun place to walk around and to imagine what life must have been like then, in the late 1800's when the family that owned the land first moved to the area. I really like photographing the red barn and trying to capture different images of it", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "3ea17847-caab-4792-a105-1645c28dc2ce", "url": "https://lostinsiouxland.wordpress.com/tag/adams-homestead-and-nature-preserve/"}
{"text": "a very grand pressigny\n\n8 July 2018\n\nWith what seems like an endless stream of visitors after our brief holiday in the Dordogne and a flying visit back to the UK last month I now find it's more than a whole month since my last post!\n\nI WILL post more about our holiday at some point but on the whole it was not a huge success. The gîte was horrible, utterly charmless, uncomfortable and right next to a very noisy road. The weather was not great and when it's raining is when you need a nice gîte to relax in – either that or you drive around in the rain. We didn't last the whole week and gave up on the Thursday – returning to our own lovely home in France and to better weather too. Hey ho.\n\nOne of the good things about having visitors is that in order to entertain them we visit places we haven't been for a long time or ones that are completely new to us. So it is that we went to the Château de L'Islette.\n\nIt's not far from Château de Azay-le-Rideau along the road in the direction of Langeais and although we must have driven past it dozens of times it's only recently that we noticed it was there.\n\nThere is a reason for this – that it has only been opened up to the public in recent years and I think it was probably previously hidden behind tall hedges and trees. The family that have restored it now live in it for seven months of the year, moving out to the farm on the estate over the summer months so that visitors can see it.\n\nIt is truly delightful, obviously a family home as judged by the furnishings and the kitchen. It seems both funny and charming to see Ikea furniture and other bits and pieces amongst antique furniture and fittings. So normal yet truly grand at the same time.\n\nThe bathroom is heavy on wow factor and utterly fabulous. In fact the whole house (or the bit you are allowed to view) is just gorgeous. Everything you would like your own château to be if you were lucky enough to own one.\n\nYou can only think that the owners must be very nice people indeed. Everything for the visitor is provided thoughtfully and carefully, even down to the little pieces of prickly holly placed tactfully on the chairs you should not sit on and very comfy cushions on the ones that you should. So much nicer than the stern notices in other houses declaring that one should not place one's bottom here or else!\n\nAs a day out it is very worth the €9 entrance fee AND it offers the free visit as well as the dreaded guided tour.\n\nWe thoroughly enjoyed our time there and will go back again for a second look before long. There are always things you don't take in on the first visit. We went on a blisteringly hot day and it was lovely to spend time inside where it was cool – next time we might feel more like exploring the outdoors too.\n\nBack at home we are pleased that the fields that surround our house on three sides (all four sides if you include the fields across the road) have been harvested. We dread the actual day that it happens as the noise and dust are intense. We shut all the doors and windows as well as the cat flap and the house vibrates as the machine comes right up to the back wall. In reality Daisy usually heads for a hiding space under a bed or in the wardrobe as soon as she hears the tractor coming and shows no sign of wanting to venture outside until well after it has gone.\n\nOur famer – that's how we think of the farmer who owns the land which surrounds the house – alternates between corn and rape (colza) crops and this year has been rape. It's an unattractive plant. Bright and cheerful briefly when in flower but untidy and smelly afterwards. It grows to about shoulder height and smells like boiled cabbage when damp – and damp is something we have had a lot of this year.\n\nIt takes the farmer less than a full day to get the whole lot in, finishing off by emptying the black seeds into another tractor which then takes them to the grain store. He leaves behind a thick layer of dust which lies between the rows of dry stubble but the view and the smell are dramatically improved. As are the reduction in the number of flies and the increase in Daisy's supply of mice – they must be easier to catch when she has no thick undergrowth to fight her way through!\n\nAnd so life in rural France goes on. The harvest is in, the grass is growing slowly due to the heat and needs only occasional mowing and the day to day business of shopping, cooking, eating and entertaining visitors continues. The summer is flying by.\n\n27 May 2018\n\nRoughly this time last year we spent a week in the little town of St Emilion, staying in a lovely little gite in the middle of town. I wrote about the holiday at length and the gite was beautifully appointed and very stylish. What it lacked in the practical it made up for in bucketfuls in style and presentation.\n\nWe now find ourselves back in the same area, this time just outside Bergerac, for another week and in another gite.\n\nChalk and cheese is the expression that immediately springs to mind!\n\nWhen choosing somewhere to stay, we were led by the needs of our puppy Hugo. Daisy is in the cattery (wearing her best \"we are not amused\" expression) but we had to bring Hugo with us, so we looked for safe enclosed garden and somewhere nearby to be able to take him for a walk off the lead without having to get into the car and drive a long way. This gite has a small enclosed garden and a nice walk in woodland and around a small lake close by.\n\nThe style of the gite was described as traditional French so it's full of big old fashioned furniture. The kitchenette and bathroom are basic, which is fine, although some of the motley collection of crockery, pots and pans have seen better days.\n\nThe disappointing thing is that the gite is right by the road which at times can be very busy, including Sunday morning when presumably people are heading for the nearby boulangerie which opens very early!\n\nHowever, Hugo loves it! The nearby walk around the lake – the reason why we booked the gite in the first place – suits him just fine. Hey ho.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nChanging the subject completely, we recently managed to solve a longstanding problem with our house in France.\n\nThe house is in an area where we have very hard water. We have had to use filtered water in the kettle and coffee machine to prevent the visible bloom of white limescale that eventually causes them to fur up. Also water softening tablets in the washing machine and salt in the dishwasher to avoid the unseen build up of limescale that would inevitably cause them to stop working too.\n\nYears ago, when we lived in our old house in the UK, we had a koi pond. Blanket weed is a problem with koi ponds. The koi love it but what any koi keeper wants is to be able to see the koi – just knowing that they are there under a thick layer of blanket weed is not enough! This problem was solved completely when we fitted something called a Water King, a magnetic device that structurally alters the calcium in the pond water so that the weed cannot attach to it and therefore can't grow. Now that we have been reminded of it, in the promotional material for the device it was mentioned that it can also be used for removal of calcium in domestic water supplies. Also that larger scale versions are used in municipal buildings and institutions, such as hospitals, to keep the water pipes free from build up of limescale.\n\nA recent conversation with a friend who told us he has something similar in his water supply jogged our memory and so we looked into it and sure enough – the Water King is still available for use in domestic water systems. No need for a water softener and constant use of salt or chemicals – you just fit it to an existing piece of inlet pipe and the job's done. Not only does it prevent the formation of limescale, over time it will also remove limescale deposits from items already affected.\n\nIt has been a huge success. A month after we fitted it we no longer get build up of limescale in the kettle so we can assume that all our other appliances are free of it too. Our wine glasses are sparkling and clear instead of bloomed with white spots. Not least of all, our three toilets, which have taken me years to get clean, scrubbing and treating with anti-limescale products, look positively pristine.\n\n30 April 2018\n\nHaving spent the first few weeks chez nous mending things and recovering from an exhausting six months in the UK, and a dreadful journey back to France (with my second cold of the year so far in full flood), we are beginning at last to slip back into our French way of life.\n\nOur tulips soon came into full bloom and what a joy they were. They are finished now of course, but every year I marvel at their shapes and sizes, filling the garden with a riot of colour just at the time when we need it the most to cheer us up and reassure us that it is, at last, Spring.\n\nNick had planted them during his flying visit back to \"close up\" the house last November. The bulbs had been lifted after the flowers had finished last spring and he stuffed them into flower beds and pots.\n\nHugo has taken to his new surroundings like a duck to water. We have resumed the daily walks that we used to do with Lulu and he is loving every minute of it, exploring the sights, sounds and smells including so many things he has not encountered before. In the picture above he was standing completely motionless (not a common occurrence), fascinated by the frog chorus at the lake at La Celle-Guenand.\n\nDaisy is delighted to be back in her real home. She instantly reacquainted herself with her old surroundings and with the rodent population, quickly losing the weight she gained over the winter and becoming her old sylph like self.\n\nFor the first couple of weeks we declined some invitations to events, feeling that we were not great company and needed to catch up on our sleep and reorientate ourselves. Gradually we began to get back into the swing of things. One of our first outings was to a concert by local choirs in the church at Preuilly, a spectacular event in fabulous surroundings.\n\nAt the \"foire à l'oignons\" at St Branchs we enjoyed a slice of delicious onion tart and a glass of rosé as well as buying some lovely early season strawberries for our dessert later.\n\nWe resisted most of the bargains on sale, including a selection of old typewriters and a pile of plates that matched our UK dinner service – the one that was my mum's Sunday best china back in the 80's. I wonder how they got there.\n\nSince we returned we have got on with all the chores that are inevitable when a house has been empty for a long spell. As well as repairing things, sorting out the garden and getting it ready for summer use, we had a lot of indoor cleaning and preparation to do for the arrival of our first visitors - my brother, my dad and his lady friend, Sybil. We had decided to let Dad and Sybil have our bedroom for their stay so that they would be able to use its \"ensuite\" shower room, much safer than the shower over the bath in the bathroom, not to mention the two steps down to it. The idea of either of them falling in the middle of the night as they tried to remember the steps on their way to the bathroom was not worth risking. The only problem was – what to do about the open shower and toilet facilities in the bedroom that pass for the said \"ensuite\".\n\nThis facility deserves a blog post of its own later but suffice it to say I didn't think Dad and Sybil would be too comfortable with the view of the loo from the bedroom so as a temporary measure I screened it off using some curtains. Nick says it looks \"very French\" but personally I think it looks daft and a bit too shabby chic (or home made) for my liking, but it will do the job for now.\n\nOur visitors have arrived and we're enjoying showing them around the sights and the places that we love. They're having a great time.\n\nIt is good to be back. A whole six months away has been way too long but it certainly makes me realise how lucky we are to have a home in this beautiful part of France. They say that absence makes the heart grow fonder but we were in the UK for so long that I was beginning to forget what it was like here. Now that I'm back I wonder how I could ever have torn myself away.\n\nIn reality I think I'm going to enjoy living in two countries. The best of both worlds and how wonderful to be returning to France at such a lovely time of year, when everything is bursting into life and with the prospect of long summer days not far ahead.\n\n9 April 2018\n\nWell here we are back in France after what turned out to be the worst journey ever to get here. As always (and how often have I said this) all the trouble and trauma was on the UK side.\n\nWe left home at 10.00am on Saturday 24th March, giving ourselves plenty of time to get our 3.50pm crossing via the tunnel and should have arrived at our hotel in France in good time for dinner in the evening followed by a good night's sleep. By travelling on a Saturday we had hoped to avoid most of the traffic problems that we would encounter during the week.\n\nWith dog and cat on board – Hugo having never travelled such a long way in the car before and Daisy being a seasoned if not a happy traveller – we hit our first problem only five miles from home where the M1 was closed following an accident.\n\nThings went from bad to worse and we ended up having to change our route to avoid closed motorways and delays several times. We arrived at the tunnel after a total journey time of seven hours, double what it should have been. Then we had to wait for two hours at the terminal before we could get a space on a train. The French word for a traffic jam is the same as for a cork – a bouchon.\n\nWe arrived at our hotel near Calais at 9pm, too late to order dinner in the restaurant. We were exhausted, Hugo and Daisy on the other hand were extremely lively having spent all day asleep or resting.\n\nLuckily for us the hotel did an excellent room service and at 10pm we were eating a delicious \"gourmet platter\" in our room, followed by a lovely dessert and accompanied by a nice bottle of wine. How glad we were to get the cork or bouchon out of that bottle and relax with a plate of good food. It's amazing how a good meal can lift the spirits.\n\nOn Sunday 25th we had a typically easy, pleasant run down through France, arriving chez nous in beautiful warm sunshine at about 4pm. We were so pleased to be home again but unfortunately our delight was short lived.\n\nWhen Nick turned on the main water supply there was the sound of rushing water in a place where we would not expect to hear water running at all. That could only mean one thing – burst pipes.\n\nThe rushing sound was coming from behind the plasterboard wall behind the stairs. Frantically he drilled holes in the plasterboard to locate the running water and was met with a horizontal torrent of water gushing along the inside of the back wall of the house from pipes that feed the upstairs radiators. He turned the water off again and we stuffed dishcloths in the holes he'd made in the wall to stop the howling gale that was coming in. The house was really cold inside, despite the spring sunshine outside.\n\nWith the heating not working we decided to get the wood burning fires going as soon as possible – but they would not light! Thick wood smoke puthered out of both fires, filling the rooms rapidly. We prepared to spend a very chilly night with the few electric heaters of our own that we had plus the ones that Alex and Nicole rushed round with, bless them.\n\nThree days later the plumbers arrived to fix the leak. This proved to be tricky because the damaged pipes were in an awkward place and also because they were English copper pipes which are a different diameter to French pipes. Luckily Nick was aware that the house had been plumbed with English pipe and fittings so had brought a miscellaneous box of English fittings some time ago for just such emergencies. The mystery was why the burst had occurred at all because we had tried to avoid such problems by leaving the heating on a low setting so that the house would not reach a low enough temperature for any of the pipe to freeze up.\n\nThe explanation became apparent when the plumbers started work. Judging by the appearance and condition it seemed that some of the old English pipe had been seeping for a very long time, possibly years. Not enough for a leak to be noticed but enough to gradually cause a loss of pressure in the boiler and cause it to stop working.\n\nIn the past the boiler had lost a bit of pressure and Nick had topped it up but in our absence the pressure had continued to drop without us knowing. Unluckily for us this happened at just the wrong time when the infamous \"beast from the east\" struck and the bitterly cold winds on the north wall of the house caused a drop in temperature in the house sufficient to freeze up this section of pipe.\n\nThe problem with the fires was easier to solve. According to the plumbers the cause was a bouchon d'air in both sides of the chimney, a plug or bouchon of damp air sitting in the chimney that was shifted by warming the fires up gradually to disperse it. Nick let a couple of firelighters burn away in each fire before relighting them and to our relief the flames flickered then stayed in and burned normally. With the heating working and the fires going it was lovely to feel warm again!\n\nDuring our first few days chez nous the neighbour was noticeably absent. On previous occasions when we have returned after being away for a while he had walked up and down the lane from his little house with his dog umpteen times a day, staring at us in his sideways fashion through the fence and the gate. From the end of his lane it looked like his door and shutters were not only closed but also barricaded with planks of wood.\n\nFour days into our stay we learned that he had been taken into a home last autumn and died some time this year.\n\nWhat a shame. He seemed to us to have a thoroughly miserable life, living by himself with just his little dog for company and the short daily visits from his carer. His shouting and yelling at the top of his voice was hard to ignore. As soon as I went out to hang washing he would stand in front of his house and bellow in such a way that you would think someone was trying to murder him. It was a horrible, unnatural and chilling sound that I will not miss. He would march up and down in front of our house staring at us and shouting when we were out and about and I worried constantly for the safety of Daisy who he had kidnapped when she was a kitten, also for his little dog who he was seen to beat mercilessly, kicking her over and over again. People in the village had described him as harmless but we knew different.\n\nIt's a shame he didn't have a better life and more human contact, although perhaps it's wrong to assume that he was unhappy just because he didn't have the things that make us happy. We will never know. I sincerely hope that if he was a lonely and troubled soul, that he is now at peace.\n\n22 March 2018\n\nTomorrow is our last day in the UK for a while. We have a huge pile of stuff to cram into the car, along with the dog and cat and of course the bicycles on the cycle rack which perches on the tow bar. We never used them. When we had a minute to spare the weather was awful. When the weather was better we were frantically working to a deadline to get something finished in the house.\n\nI'm so excited. Part of me is in panic in case I forget anything important because we will be in France for a long time. Another part is irritated that we haven't finished the project we started last October – to renovate our 1960's old folks' bungalow. A third part reminds me that we are going to a civilised country where we can get everything we could possibly need and as long as we don't forget the cat, the dog, our passports and theirs, there is nothing we can't manage without. A fourth part tells me that we've achieved an awful lot in the last six months, transforming a tired old person's house into a nice modern home, and what hasn't been done already will still be there in the autumn and give us something to do over next winter.\n\nThis winter has been a trial, that's for sure. The last time we had such a long, wet, cold and unpleasant winter was in 2012/13 and that was so awful that I decided I could no longer face battling my way to work in the snow and packed it in – retired before I got my pension because I couldn't stand it any longer. What a good decision that was!\n\nThis winter has been slightly less snowy but incredibly wet, cold and grey. Not ideal for getting and training a new puppy, but what a joy he has been. With the renovations and the endless work on the house I feel that my lasting memories of this winter will be of mess, muck and mud. The mess and muck coming from the building work on the house and the constant shuffling of our belongings from one room to another. The mud coming from the inevitable ingress of the stuff into the house when you have a puppy that needs to \"go\" so often and the garden and all the local footpaths are ankle deep in slippery, slimy mud. Not to mention having a puppy that has learned pretty quickly that if he persuades us that he needs to \"go\" he gets a chance to chase the cat around the muddy garden whether he actually needs to go or not!\n\nI can't wait to get to France and put it all well and truly behind me. Only two more sleeps!\n\n10 March 2018\n\nWell, February disappeared in a blur of activity in the new house. With deadlines to meet of one sort or another we frantically sanded and painted walls, rerouted wiring, added more electric sockets than we can surely ever need and moved our belongings for the umpteenth time in and out of rooms to make way for the fitting of carpets, flooring and so on. My laptop languished untouched under a pile of papers in the corner of the bedroom and whoosh – suddenly we are into March.\n\nTime to look back at the photos again and the joy of the familiar suddenly made me smile. Events that come round every year and that we never get fed up with. One of them is the annual garden event at Château de la Bourdaisiere near Montlouis.\n\nIt's a lovely day out at a time of year when you really need to see that kind of thing, beautiful flowers and plants full of colour and promise of the good weather that will inevitably arrive. Not to mention the food producers, craft stalls and the fluffy chicken exhibition.\n\nWe don't necessarily go to it every year, but we never tire of it. The château and grounds are beautiful and in fact it is now a hotel. The garden event is huge and we usually buy something. Last time it was a gorgeous dark purple lily, this time one of the cute bird baths.\n\nAnd of course we enjoyed a delicious cake and coffee in the tearoom.\n\nAnother event we went to last April was the open day, \"portes ouvertes\", of the local potter in the village. She lives just outside Le Grand Pressigny and produces beautiful decorative and useful pottery in a studio at her home.\n\nWe have bought quite a few pieces over the years, either for ourselves or as presents. She now has a shop in the village where you can buy her pottery and her partner's gorgeous leather work.\n\nHer old bread oven had been lit and used that morning. There was still plenty of bread for sale when we turned up after lunch so we treated ourselves to a loaf. Very good it was too.\n\nThere was something immensely charming and fascinating about seeing the old oven in use. So many people would have relied on the regular production of bread in that very oven, food to keep them alive probably, and very hard work it would have been to produce it. What a joy it was to see (and eat) real, rather misshapen and very rustic loaves, so different from the stuff on the supermarket shelves and even the local bakery, where it's all so uniformly shaped.\n\nSpeaking of regular events, I suppose you would count a birthday as one of those. For a friend's 70th birthday and a surprise party I was asked to make a novelty cake in the shape of his favourite English food – fish and chips. It was a bit of a challenge but I managed it, including sugar salt, apple juice vinegar and green marzipan peas!\n\nAlong with the comfort of the familiar comes the joy of a new discovery. For us anyway. In a shop in Descartes we discovered a cheese we had never seen before, made just up the road from us in Neuilly-le-Brignon. It's called Bourdel and is not cheap but utterly delicious with an interesting rind, strong flavour and a firm texture. Since we bought our first one last spring it has made a regular appearance at our cheese course.

{"text": "Film, arts & currents affairs wumman in Scotland.\nAll views are my own, and probably influenced by how early it is.\n\nJun 8, 2015\n\nContains: Charles Kennedy's radio adventures, Borgenspotting, Sepp Blatter — sex god, things that should be left to rot in the 1990s, Sky Arts, and I'd rather walk to Ibiza than fly Ryanair\n\nScottish Daily Mail June 9 2015\n\nI was asleep when a radio reporter called to tell me that Charles Kennedy had died. Even now, a week later, writing that sentence floors me.\n\nIn my head, I still hear his laugh, or his low-tar voice down the phone, or see him cock his head quizzically in response to some outrageous theory of mine. In all the years I knew Charles, we never had a fight because Charles was unfailingly courteous. But I knew when he profoundly disagreed with me, because he would say, with deceptive mildness, \"D'ye think so?\"\n\nI first met Charlie when I was a researcher for BBC radio. I hadn't been with the station for very long, and Charles was already a rising political star. I called him at the Commons to invite him onto a current affairs programme to discuss his party's policy on an arcane aspect of maritime shipping law. \"Of course I'll do it,\" he said, cheerfully. \"Do you happen to know what our policy is?\"\n\nLater we teamed up as producer and presenter for a series of one-to-one interviews recorded when Parliament was in summer recess. Officially this was called \"The Kennedy Conversations\", although locally it was dubbed \"Parly with Charlie\". Around this time others called him \"Chat Show Charlie\" but he was a good, tactful interviewer and journalist, even when James Naughtie spent most of the lunch prior to the show lecturing Charles on how to further his political career (\"Keep people at a distance, Jim? D'ye think so?\")\n\nCharles' interest was informal and genuine, and people opened up to him. John Smith confided that he thought he had only one shot at bringing Labour to power, while Andrew Neill admitted his regret over socialising with Pamella Bordes, a companion who turned out to be a high-class call girl.\n\nCharlie himself may not have been traditional matinee idol material, but he had bags of charm. Selina Scott offered to improve Charlie's wardrobe by taking him out to buy a pair of cowboy boots: he resisted. A gay Scottish celebrity took a particular shine to him, his attention piqued by Charles' excited talk of wining and dining his new partner George. It was left to me to tell the celeb that Charles was then stepping out with book PR Georgina Capel.\n\nAfter work was done, we would let down our hair and celebrate with chair races down the Commons corridors — until we were caught and told off by security — and at the end of our last series, Charles shyly presented me with a bottle of perfume. I was touched to discover he'd padded around the House of Fraser counters himself, quizzing counter ladies for advice.\n\nWe never worked together again but stayed in touch, and had planned to meet this year once Indyref and the election votes were put to bed. A great deal has been written about Charles' alcoholism, most of it decent, thoughtful and supportive. Charles had some tough years, especially the loss of his parents, his best friend, the failure of his marriage, and the death of Anna Werrin, his assistant from the start of Charles' Commons career. He dealt with awful sadness as best he could, and in private, because he would have regarded pressing his problems onto others as a lapse in Kennedy politesse. Charlie was a genuine gentle man, but as the world became less sincere, and even rather vindictive, he struggled. The outpouring of affection this week would have delighted and astonished him. Loved? I think so.\n\nOOO\n\nThe spanish newspaper El Mundo has offered a long list of women believed to have been romanced by Sepp Blatter while he was president of FIFA. Forget soft drinks manufacturers or credit cards: the next World Cup should be sponsored by Specsavers.\n\nOOO\n\nLunching last week at a delightful hingoot in Glasgow's sparkling west end, I gave my dining companion a quick dig in the ribs when a couple of men strolled through the door. \"Look,\" I stage-whispered. \"It's JJ Field\".\n\nMy lunch companion was more astute. \"I don't know who JJ Field is,\" he hissed back — apparently BBC's Three Musketeers isn't quite the mainstream hit I imagine — \"But the man beside him is Kasper from Borgen\".\n\nImmediately all heads in the eaterie rotated like tryouts for The Exorcist in order to clock Pilou Asbaek, star of Denmark's rain-drenched West Wing\n\nIt's ironic that, despite years sitting in hotel rooms interviewing actors and actresses, I am completely useless at spotting them in real life, unless their starpower has the wattage of Pluto on a rainy night.\n\nProbably a waiter or something\n\nStrolling along the Croisette in Cannes, I mentally backpatted myself for recognising Anthony Andrews from the 1980s dramatisation of Brideshead Revisited, yet completely failed to clock Quentin Tarantino holding court a few feet further on, until both appeared in a trades snapshot the following day.\n\nIn the lobby of a London hotel, I exchanged nods with a smartly-suited young waiter, who turned out to be Keanu Reeves. And when a kind middle-aged man held the door open for me with a smile, I swept past with the fleeting thought that he resembled The Hunt For Red October's Alec Baldwin. And of course, that is who he was.\n\nTom Cruise, Hugh Grant, Bill Nighy — you name them; I've walked past them. At best, I might perhaps think 'Hmm, he seems familiar — maybe we were at school together' as I briskly overtake some multimillionaire idol.\n\nOOO\n\nThings we don't miss from the 90s: beany babies, the \"Rachel\" haircut, Loaded magazine, and TFIF Friday. It's 19 years since Chris Evans presented the Channel 4 pop and chat show that rounded up unappetising egomaniacs and usefully stashed them away in a live TV studio so they couldn't ruin everyone's weekend.\n\nThey have kilts. Where are our tasers\n\nDespite its star-studded guest list, TFI Friday was always uncomfortable viewing, because there were no sympathetic participants, down to an audience which chortled over boorishly witless inserts such as \"bird or bloke\" (hey, that woman looks a bit like a man) or \"fat lookalikes\". Above all, the show was built around the cock-eyed idea that viewers could happily endure Chris Evans, his producer Will and Danny Baker exchange grim pubby 'bants' studded with gor-blimey condescension. In one edition, they even relocated the show to their local.\n\nNow Britpop's answer to Top Gear is back for one night only. I'll be watching — if the special guests include a pride of hungry lions.\n\nOOO\n\nA large gold nugget worth £10,000 was found by a first timer while panning a river near Wanlockhead.\n\nIn other news, I have now found a location for my 10 year old goddaughter's birthday party and treasure hunt.\n\nOOO\n\n\"Hell is other people,\" said Jean-Paul Sartre, which confirms that some French philosophers have never had to tangle with low budget airlines.\n\nIf it isn't Kate Moss swigging vodka in the Easyjet seat beside you, it's the prospect of having to change your name by deed poll, because it is cheaper and easier than changing a Ryanair ticket.\n\n19 year old Adam Armstrong decided to rename himself Adam West after his girlfriend's father mistakenly booked a trip to Ibiza for him under that name, and the airline asked for £220 to put his birth name back on the ticket. So he changed his name and passport instead\n\nMy sympathy lies entirely with Adam. The last time I flew with Ryanair, from London to Scotland, I turned up with one item of handbaggage — a plastic bag containing a chicken I had picked up for dinner at the airport Tescos. At check in, I was told this would have to go in the hold \"for safety reasons\". I never did find out what sort of real and present danger my ready-basted chicken might present in-flight. I certainly wasn't planning to fire up a barbecue from row 17.\n\nEver since, when someone outwits these airlines, I give a cheer — and not the tinny recorded kind that is played over the tannoy when your budget flight contrives to land at its destination. From the sharkish baggage and ticket charges, to the brass neck of charging for cup-a-soup as an inflight meal, to the wisdom of staffing a heavier-than-air bus with an entire crew that look as if they are on a school outing, there is little pleasure in taking to their unfriendly skies. I would rather fly with Glenn Miller.\n\nOOO\n\nCongratulations to Sir Bradley for crushing cycling are hour distance record at Lee Valley VeloPark this week. Although it is hard to imagine folk watching Wiggins cycle round and round in a circle for an hour, when the Grand Prix is on the other side…\n\nThe ecstasy of achievement\n\nOOO\n\n\"We love arts and entertainment as much as you do\" proclaims Sky Arts on its Twitter page. Hard to believe, given they've just axed Sky Arts 2. Apparently in sunny Sky world, merging Arts 1 and Arts 2 means \"all your arts in one great place!\" Or, as it's also known: half as much arts.", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "62f8bc12-485f-4d98-96a4-2f6e26d49d6f", "url": "https://medium.com/@SiobhanSynnot/contains-charles-kennedy-s-radio-adventures-borgenspotting-sepp-blatter-sex-god-things-that-eb7b98dc74ae"}

Maude's menu may be the most expensive truffle tasting in the city at $375 for 10 courses, but Curtis Stone's cooking has garnered well-deserved accolades. The white truffle will be paired with other seasonal ingredients such as root vegetables, winter squash, fall fruits, chestnuts, and more. Reservations are here.\n\nMelisse Chef Josiah Citrin's fine dining restaurant in Santa Monica is offering white truffle dishes a la carte or a substitution to the tasting menu.

These dishes are $120 ($95 supplement if substituted on the tasting menu). Additionally, while supplies are available, truffle lovers can add 4 grams of white truffle to any dish for $80. Reservations are here.\n\nMichael's on Naples This Long Beach icon is hosting its annual truffle dinner on Nov. 10, featuring a four-course meal with truffles.

{"text": "Morris's Sweet 'Serenade': Keeping It Pure and Simple\n\nBySarah Kaufman\n\nMarch 10, 2003\n\nPart kimono-clad empress, part inner-directed samurai, Mark Morris is at his joyful and sensuous best in \"Serenade,\" the solo given its world premiere Saturday at George Mason University. He establishes little new choreographic ground here, nor does he open new avenues of expression. And we've seen the choreographer work these themes before: the holiness of great music and the mystery of androgyny. Yet \"Serenade\" is a distillation of Morris's aesthetic in a new, pure fashion. In a quiet, undemonstrative way, it is the essential Morris.\n\nThe work is deceptively simple: Morris is aglow on a darkened stage, dancing on a rather small scale -- a shoulder roll here, a few stamps there -- while off to the side a guitarist and percussionist ripple through Lou Harrison's delicate \"Serenade for Guitar.\" Morris is dressed by Isaac Mizrahi in a white wrap top, tied with a bow at the back, and long, full black skirt -- an elegant costume that suggests the meticulous folds and ritualistic precision of formal Japanese dress for both sexes. Morris's dancing, too, crosses gender lines, in its mix of forceful, percussive hopping and soft, silky arms.\n\nMorris performs each of the five sections with a different prop: For the first he is seated on a small stool, for the second he brandishes a gleaming baton, then he uses a fan, finger cymbals and castanets. He doesn't leave the stage between sections; he picks up each new accessory and deposits the old one on a stand over by the musicians (Oren Fader on guitar, Stefan Schatz on percussion). The whole proceeding has a straightforward, matter-of-fact feel.\n\nThis puts the focus on what has always been of utmost importance to Morris: beautiful movement, beautiful music, presented in unbroken harmony that feels as natural as breathing. This was apparent on a larger scale in the three other works on the Mark Morris Dance Group's program -- \"New Love Song Waltzes,\" \"Going Away Party\" and \"V\" -- but \"Serenade\" was a tutorial of exquisite concision.\n\nIt was also a showpiece for the uninhibited, robust movement style that is a Morris hallmark. In his mid-forties and, shall we say, generously proportioned, Morris is nevertheless the most natural mover in his company, able to seem completely, ecstatically abandoned in a complicated thicket of steps. He has created nearly 20 other solos, many of them more dramatically driven or emotionally rich than \"Serenade.\" But \"Serenade,\" in its shadows, its isolation of one or two serenely moving limbs, and its perfect marriage with Harrison's gossamer-fine composition, is a gentle gem.\n\nIts modesty was also an effective counterpoint to the ebullient quality of the group works. Seeing \"V,\" the program's closer, remains as thrilling and uplifting an experience as it was on first viewing last year; by the work's end, it feels as much a triumphant affirmation of the human spirit as George Balanchine's \"The Four Temperaments\" or Frederick Ashton's \"Symphonic Variations.\" What was especially interesting Saturday, however, was seeing the image of troubled relations refracted and digested in different ways in \"V\" as well as in \"New Love Song Waltzes\" (1982) and \"Going Away Party\" (1990).\n\n\"Going Away Party\" has a boppy, pushy, \"how y'all doin' \" feel at the outset -- the dancers are in jeans, cowboy boots, culottes and kicky red pumps. The country-western songs by Bob Wills and His Texas Playboys carry the three couples through a Texas two-step and stylized square dance sequences; it looks like so much fun you expect a pitcher of beer and a platter of tamales to materialize. Then you notice the happy time starting to spoil. Gestures morph: Are the women freshening their lipstick -- or holding their men at gunpoint? A line in a song urging the listener to \"get on your knees and pray\" turns into what looks like a forced sex act -- certainly a demeaning one -- and the men mime relieving themselves afterward. A lone dancer, who is black (Charlton Boyd), is the odd man out, never invited to join the couples (all white), and seeming not to care . . . or not much.\n\n\"New Love Song Waltzes,\" created back when the Mark Morris Dance Group was new, also presents problematic views of love. Brahms's Neue Liebeslieder Walzer, Op. 65 (gorgeously sung by Eileen Clark, Barbara Rearick, James Archie Worley and Christopher Roselli), accompanied the dancers' at times tender, at times contentious pairings. But as in \"V,\" the broken hearts find salvation in the group, where contact is made, hands are clasped, and yet there is room for a dancer to gaze off at her own horizon. The collective doesn't mandate conformity; it leaves room for individual expression. This is, in fact, what Morris has created for himself with his dance company.\n\nMark Morris in the world premiere of \"Serenade,\" which distills the choreographer's recurrent themes concerning music and androgyny.", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "55ee0fc5-90e8-4c5a-8f12-2115270233c7", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/2003/03/10/morriss-sweet-serenade-keeping-it-pure-and-simple/5c62dc60-9a80-400a-beb7-9be3cd4ec484/"}
{"text": "Emergency Advance Cash Fast\n\nSometimes the regular pay check just doesn't stretch as far as it should. Many times we find ourselves staring at an unexpected expense, without enough money in the bank to pay for it. It's just these types of situations that lead many people to go online to take out payday loans. If you suspect that you need to get some fast cash in the bank, and plan on taking out a payday loan to get that money you are currently in need of, this post should help you to sort out all the facts to make a smart choice for your upcoming online borrowing needs.\n\nYour Payday Loan is an Unsecured Loan\n\nNot all loans are created equal. For example, some loans are secured loans. This means that you have to offer your personal property – vehicles, homes, etc… – as security on your loan. When you take out an online advance cash loan, however, you are getting what is called an unsecured loan. You don't have to put your property on the line as collateral for these types of loans. Since most payday loans are smaller than the traditional bank loans that you might be familiar with, there is no need for you to offer up any security to your lender.\n\nCash Loan Bad Credit FACTS\n\nBad credit can be a hindrance to you in many areas of life. There are even some people who are finding that they can't land their dream jobs because their potential employers won't even hire new employees with low credit scores. You can breathe easy when you apply for an online payday loan, though, because lending companies do not require you to submit a credit check. To make a long story short, your lower credit score will not stop you from getting loan approval online.\n\nAdvance Cash Loan: Cash Loan Review Websites\n\nYou must be careful when using online reviews to find your advance cash loan. There are many loan review sites that are nothing more than advertising portals for popular lenders.

The winery is housed in a re-purposed \"big ole barn\" including a banquet hall in the haymow. This air-conditioned space will serve as our home base for the day. We can also spill out into the great outdoors for a round of horseshoes.\n\nOf course, other family traditions of the day will continue such as the silent auction of family treasures, Sheepshead and sharing of pictures and stories. We have a few new things planned as well including a game of FAMILY, wine tasting and a tour of the vineyard and winery. And, of course we will eat well!\n\nThroughout the day, snacks and non-alcoholic beverages including tea, water, lemonade and coffee will be provided as part of the registration. Wine will be available in tastings and for purchase by the glass or bottle for those of age.

As the dust settles, one hopes that we emerge stronger and perhaps slightly wiser. Through it all, we can seek peace and beauty in art. Come to the Bankhead to enjoy soothing music, listen to a lecture or rock to an old favorite. Head to the Bothwell to take part in a pencil sketch class or hear an intimate concert. Whatever your interest, you are sure to find a place at Livermore Valley Performing Arts Center.\n\nWe have two challenges I hope you will join us in meeting. First, we are raising the bar for our end-of-year fundraising campaign. A very generous donor has pledged a matching gift of $150,000, so every dollar we raise in November and December will be matched one-to-one up to $150,000. The second challenge is to reach 1,000 members in 2016. With over 925 now, we hope if you are not already a member, you will join and help us reach that goal.\n\nAs in politics, we in the arts are sustained by the participation of our citizens.

We have worked hard to design a season that will engage every segment of our community and expands in new directions. There will be music from classical, Celtic and Broadway to acoustic jazz, rock and R&B. This year there will be more theatrical productions and the Diavolo|Architecture in Motion dance residency in early September is just the start of an amazing year of modern American dance with both Parsons Dance and the Paul Taylor Dance Company.\n\nAt the Bankhead and the Bothwell there are opportunities to be engaged and entertained all year long.

As September 10th draws closer, the excitement at the Bankhead will continue to grow. Along with a stellar concert, we have a fabulous menu prepared for an elegant yet casual evening under the stars.

Direct from Beijing, these amazing athletes thrill audiences of all ages with remarkable feats of balance, juggling, contortion, and a gravity-defying ability to fly across the stage. \"Peking Dreams\" is only the first of more than a dozen events in LVPAC Presents' ninth season which showcases performing arts from nearly every continent. Upcoming events range from \"A Taste of Africa\" and \"Bollywood Masala Orchestra and Dancers,\" to \"A Celtic Christmas\" and the brilliant flamenco of Paco Peña. \"Peking Dreams\" will appear at the Bankhead Theater for just one matinee performance on Sunday, September 13, 2015 at 2:00 p.m.\n\nFounded more than six decades ago, the National Circus and Acrobats of the People's Republic of China is one of the longest running and most distinguished circus troupes in China. Enhanced by spectacular lighting and costumes, their award-winning acts have filled venues worldwide and won over twenty Gold and Silver medals and other awards at international festivals. Considered innovators in the world of circus companies, the National Circus and Acrobats of the People's Republic of China have perfected such acts as the grand flying trapeze, giant teeterboard, group contortions, as well as a variety of balancing acts using hoops, poles, balls, ladders and cycles. Their early focus on shifting emphasis away from animal acts to dramatic human physical feats, influenced the pioneers of the now well-known \"Cirque du Soleil\" who sought coaching from them in these special skills during the 1980s.\n\nThe ancient Chinese called the circus \"the show of a hundred tricks.\" Chinese circus acts are a culturally-treasured art form with roots that date back many centuries to early folk entertainers who used objects from daily life to entertain and engage spectators. As circus feats grew in popularity, they were adopted for Imperial performances and became increasingly intricate and complex. As it has always been, circus performance continues to be centered in family tradition, with skills and expertise passed from generation to generation.\n\nThis season, more than a dozen events provide audiences at the Bankhead Theater and Bothwell Arts Center with the opportunity to experience and be immersed in the music and performing arts of other countries. Chinese artistry will be offered again in March with the GuGu Drum Group, whose authentic rhythms and dance movements tell timeless and traditional fables and stories with contemporary flair. Representing every continent except Antarctica, the 2015-2016 LVPAC Presents season includes the return of Master of the Sarod Amjad Ali Khan and Sons, as well as the Moscow Festival Ballet, Parisian film favorite \"Triplets of Belleville\" with live musical accompaniment, a traditional holiday celebration with Ballet Folklorico Mexicano de Carlos Moreno, Dakha Brahka's contemporary music of the Ukraine, and the wildly entertaining Wellington Ukulele Orchestra of New Zealand.\n\nThe Livermore Valley Performing Arts Center is dedicated to offering entertainment for all ages and encourages family attendance by offering student tickets for only $16 at nearly every event. Upcoming family-focused shows include the renowned Stunt Dog Experience, appearing Friday November 6th and two matinee performances in April by the uncrowned queen of kindie rock, Laurie Berkner, on her solo \"You and Me Tour.\" Tickets for these and all other performances in the 2015-2016 LVPAC Presents series are available now through the Bankhead Theater ticket office, online at  or via the new LVPAC mobile app.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nThe Livermore Valley Performing Arts Center provides wide-ranging programs that provide access to the arts for the Tri-Valley community and beyond. The Bankhead Theater and the Bothwell Arts Center are home to nine resident performing arts companies and over 40 studio artists and cultural arts instructors. The Bankhead Theater ticket office is open Tuesday through Saturday from 12:00 noon to 6:00 p.m. On performance days the ticket office is open from two hours before to 30 minutes after the scheduled start of each show.

{"text": "Cookbook Roundup 2018 (part 1)\n\nIf you're looking for a list of the best cookbooks of 2018, here's part 1 of some of my favorite cookbooks I've received this year.\n\nEvery year I think, THIS IS THE YEAR. The year I will NOT get any more cookbooks! And then I get more cookbooks. Because I have a slight obsession with them and even slight hoarder mentality when it comes to them. But I have no real regrets (except the regret that I didn't buy a larger bookcase). This year was an exceptional year for cookbooks! Here are some of my favorites from 2018 ((and look for my second half of my favorite cookbooks from 2018 next week!).\n\n[disclaimer: All cookbook links below are affiliate links to Amazon]\n\nI'm a huge fan of slab pies, those large sheet pan pies that can serve big groups of people. So I was excited that my friend Cathy Barrow was writing an entire cookbook about them. I was not disappointed! A columnist for the Washington Post, Pie Squared features both savory and sweet pies with a higher crust to filling ratio (slab pies are usually more shallow than their round counterparts. Unexpected savory pies including winners like Turkey Chili Frito Slab Pie with Cornbread Crust, Pan Roasted Mushroom and Kale Slab Pie, and Artichoke Dip Slab Pie (which I've sampled at an event, SO. GOOD.) while the sweet pies features treats like Raspberry Rugelach Slab Pie, No Campfire Necessary S'Mores Slab Pie and Grande Mocha Cappuccino Slab Pie. Seriously folks. I want to be Cathy's neighbor!\n\nTrue confession, I've have a recipe in Feed Your People, the large batch cooking cookbook by Leslie Jonath and 18 reasons but that's not the only reason I love this book. It's my go-to cookbook for entertaining a large crowd, with recipes that range from Root Beer Barbecued Spareribs to Big Night Timpano (I made this recently, go check out my IG stories about it, it's amazing) to Fried Chicken and Cornmeal Waffle. I love how each recipe also shows ingredients for double batches in case you're feeding an extra large crowd. And I love how each contributor (including such luminaries like Alice Medrich, Deborah Madison, Yotam Ottolenghi, Alice Waters and so many more) talk about how much feeding people is part of their soul and how making food for many is a physical example of how much you love each person eating your food. Even if you never make a recipe from this book (and you should) this is the sort of cookbook that will warm your heart as you read it.\n\nLately I've been looking to eat more satisfying well-rounded meals and Nicki Sizemore's Build-a-Bowl fits the bill perfectly. Grain bowls are all the rage for a reason. They're fun to make and easy to eat (I like my variety of foods!). Nicki not only simplifies the process, showing you how to make a variety of grain bases beyond brown rice and quinoa (like farro, sorghum, millet to name a few) but also shows you how to top your bowl for the perfect Instagram shot. Lentils, mushrooms and arugula are pulled together with an egg and a sprinkle of truffle oil while Asian meatballs are served with sesame broccoli and a sweet and spicy glaze. Personally I'm a little obsessed with making her deconstructed Pork Bahn Mi bowls as well as her bibimbap style steak with bok choy, carrots, and kimchi. Don't worry though, I don't plan on taking too many photos of my bowls for my feed. I'll be too busy diving in to bother!\n\nI remember when my friend Linda Miller Nicholson mentioned to me that she was thinking about writing a cookbook and I'm absolutely thrilled to be holding it in my hand when it arrived. Pasta, Pretty Please is exactly the sort of vibrant cookbook that you expect from someone like Linda. Her stunning colored pastas (all naturally dyed from vegetable and plants) took the internet by storm but it's dynamic personality that you will love. From the basics of how to make colorful pastas (matcha, beet, butterfly pea flower) to gorgeous patterns and shapes, this is a course on how to step up your pasta making game. But the cookbook is not a one-trick pony sort of book, as it has directions and how-to instructions on rolling, stuffing and creating various pasta shapes, as well as a chapter on luscious sauces like Spiced Lamb Yogurt sauce, Apple Bacon sauce, and the Fast Fresh Tomato Sauce with Ricotta Salata to serve the pastas with. I have a pasta machine buried in the back of my pantry and I can't wait to dig it out and start cranking away (<– pun intended there).\n\nBeautifully designed and photographed, Wine Food by Dana Frank and Andrea Slonecker is exactly what it sounds like, a cookbook focusing on wine and food pairings. But beyond that, it's the perfect cookbook for those who love wine but don't quite know where to start in terms of creating food to match. A crash course in wine, including buying, storing and tasting wine, as well as sophisticated (but not difficult to make) recipes that work for both weeknight meals as well as brunches and dinner parties. Think Sparkling Rosé paired with Falafel Waffles for a memorable brunch or Pomegranate Roasted Carrots with lentils, Labneh and Carrot-Top Zhoug paired with a Southern Rhône Red. Each recipe not only pairs with a particular wine but there are recommended wine producers as well, so you aren't completely lost at the wine store.\n\nMore and more I'm trying to find cookbooks that have me making food and not calling for carryout. We're all busy and after a day at work (or for me, a day baking away because that's what I often do for work) we rarely want to spend a lot of time in the kitchen (or for me, more time in the kitchen). So Ashley Rodriguez' book Let's Stay In is as inviting as the book title. Filled with recipes that are not only doable but WEEKNIGHT doable, this is a cookbook that I will live with. From recipes like Lemony Carbonara with Peas, Steak Tacos with Radish and Pickled Onions, and Spring Pea Falafel with Harissa Yogurt, these recipes sing with freshness.\n\nI rarely bake bread, mostly because I live two blocks away from a bakery that people travel from across the city (and from out of town) to go to. But Heritage Baking by Ellen King might get me back into the kitchen to start kneading and baking. I love the idea of baking with heritage and ancient grain flours and this book is a great starter (<– see what I did there?) for all those who are looking to bake bread with flours other than all-purpose. From creating your own starter to the various steps (autolyse, folding, shaping, resting) this book functions not only as a repository for great recipes but also for reference. I'm eyeing the cranberry walnut bread right now for the holidays, but the seeded whole wheat is the sort of everyday bread that AJ and I just adore with a thick smear of butter and jam.\n\nA few years ago I felt like there was a serious hole in the culinary world with a lack of Korean cookbooks. But since then, there's been an explosion and I say the more the merrier! I'm particularly excited about Korean BBQ by Bill Kim and Chandra Ram which deviates from the \"typical\" Korean BBQ recipes for bulgogi and galbi but instead introduces Korean and Asian-inspired grilling recipes. Recipes like Tandori Soy-Cumin Lamb, Korean Beef Satay and Ko-Rican Pork Chops all sounds amazing. But the recipe I can't wait to try out is his Seoulthern Pimento Cheese which has a healthy dose of Nuoc Cham Sauce, the Vietnamese sauce that basically makes everything better.\n\nAs much as I love cocktail, I don't have room in my tiny apartment for a million bottles of random spirits. So can certainly appreciate Maggie Hoffman's cookbook The One Bottle Cocktail. It features cocktails using a single spirit, streamline your bar and your cocktail offerings. Each chapter is broken down into spirits (rum, tequila, gin, vodka) with innovative cocktails featuring fresh ingredients like shaved fennel or harissa paste. The Golden Lion Tamarin features fresh ginger and rye whiskey, while Midnight in the Garden has a strawberry gastrique (made with balsamic vinegar) paired with light rum and lime juice. These cocktails prove that you don't need a huge bar with a massive array of bottles that you'd only use once to create innovative drinks.\n\nIt's no secret that AJ and I like to go on roadtrip and camp. All you need to do is follow us on our road trip via Instagram Stories this past summer. So I was exceedingly excited by Emma Frisch's Feast By Firelight cookbook. Her lushly photographed cookbook is filled with recipes you can make while camping or grilling outdoor next to a cabin. Packed with tips on how to prep ahead of time, these recipe function just as well for summer (or winter) when you want to cook outdoors. Honey Coriander Glazed Pork Chops sound divine while Grilled Eggplant and Zucchini with Zesty Za'atar look totally doable while camping (or maybe just on my backyard). Though some of the recipes seem to border on glamping (we usually stick to yogurt and granola when we camp, so the Tiramisu French Toast is probably a little ambitious for us) other recipes that sound daunting like Birds in a Nest with Honey Avocado are actually really doable (it's toast with eggs, avocado and a drizzle of honey). I know what I'm going to be packing in our car next summertime!\n\nLisa Q. Fetterman is the creator of the Nomiku sous vide machine and her book with co-authors Scott Peabody and Meesha Halm, Sous Vide Made Simple lives up to its name. The Nomiku machine is the one that I have in my kitchen and her first book was my introduction and gateway to sous vide. It's also what I turn to when I am looking to make something with the sous vide wand. This book simplifies the sous vide process with recipes that are easy to make for everyone. Master recipes for the protein of your choice (pork, beef, chicken, etc) along with variants uses for each protein and sides make this book a great introduction to sous vide if you are intimidated by it. I'm currently excited about trying out the Beef Bouguignon Pot Roast, the Seared Five-Spice Salmon with Stir-Fried Snow Peas and the Pork Tenderloin Piccata.\n\nIf you've followed along on my Instagram Stories at all, you know that AJ and I are obsessed with our coffee. Well, AJ is obsessed. I'm just strongly interested. Thankfully Coffee Isn't Rocket Science by Sebastien Racineaux and Chung-Leng Tran takes the mystery out of all the various ways you can make coffee beyond drip and running to your local coffee shop. Starting from the way you grind the beans, to the water you use and then onto t the way you brew, this book has everything you need, in easy to understand infographics, to brew the perfect cup of coffee for your own individual tastes. It breaks down the various different contraptions (aeropress, clever, siphon, etc) explaining how to brew for each method, as well as what the resulting cup of coffee will taste like (less body, more flavor, less sediment, cleaner taste). And it even tells you about the countries that the coffee is grown and what the tasting notes are like for each country. AJ and I (mostly AJ) will be referencing the book often (when we're not on the road sampling our coffee in third-wave coffee shops across the country).\n\nI adore Julia Turshen ever since her cookbook Small Victories came out a few years ago. So I was excited about her new cookbook Now and Then and it doesn't disappoint! She has a warm inviting voice that just makes you want to go into the kitchen and cook food for the sake of cooking food. But she's also a realist. She knows that everyone is short on time and wants to get the most out of their meals. So she created accessible solid recipes that not only will feed you for that meal but will also feed you for the next meal, with side bars that talk about how to repurpose leftovers into whole new dishes. This is the sort of cookbook that you will reaching for again and again because it's such a rich source of inspirational information. From Stir Fried Roasted Eggplant with Pork (turn the leftovers into potstickers!) to Grilled Beef and Zucchini Meatballs with Tahini Dressing (turn into meatball sandwiches) this is going to be one of my everyday favorite cookbooks!\n\nYears ago I accidentally-on-purpose sat down with the then editor of Food and Wine magazine, Dana Cowin. I tried to slip her my business card but I'm pretty sure she immediately discarded it. Nevertheless we had a lovely conversation about hip and hot restaurants in San Francisco and she specifically mentioned Rich Table as the buzzy restaurant that everyone was talking about. Fast forward to the present day when the owners Sarah and Evan Rich finally released their Rich Table cookbook. Beyond being beautiful, the recipes are approachable enough for most home cooks, with only a few ingredients that might need specialty sourcing. And even though special ingredients are often listed with more common substitutions in case you don't feel like going out and foraging for pine needles (try using dried rosemary or thyme instead). I've eaten at Rich Table and can attest that their Porcini Doughnuts with Raclette Dip is ABSOLUTELY worth every calorie. Now I can make it at home, along with their Spaghetti with Peas, Lime, Goat Cheese, and Duck Fat as well as three variations on New York Strip Steak. Sure some of the main course are a little more ambitious in scope (which they often warn you ahead of time in the headnotes) but components of most of the main dishes could be made for separately for a more casual meal. I can't wait to dive right into this one.\n\nLook for the second part of my cookbook round up next week!\n\nSpecial thanks to Black Dog & Leventhal Publishers, Chronicle Books, Grand Central Life & Style, Lorena Jones Books, Power House Books, Running Press, Storey Publishing, Ten Speed Press, and William Morrow for sending me review copies of their books.

CBS demonstrated the importance of the Thursday launch to the NFL by also having league commissioner Roger Goodell and New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft on the panel alongside CBS Sports chief Sean McManus.\nThis is a sure thing, Moonves told reporters in touting the benefits of the package to CBS primetime fortunes. Goodell emphasized that seeding an appetite for Thursday primetime games has been a priority for the past eight years on the NFL Network cabler. The one-year deal with CBS is a chance to build on the NFL s commitment to broadcast TV. He called Thursday a bookend to the NFL s weekend games.\nThere is a tremendous demand for more football on Thursday night, he said.\nCBS is in the unusual position of having this first year be something of an audition before the league commits to a long-term Thursday rights package.

Very well built and has all the flexibility needed to record just about any instrument. When using a mic it has nice clarity. You can overdrive this fairly easy though but it has a reduce gain button if a signal is way too hot. It works great with Abelton Lite and my Tascam multi tracker. I got at a decent price and worth every cent.\n\nfrom B June 09, 2016\n\nGreat Low Latency USB Interface\n\nExcellent low latency USB interface.You won't be disappointed.Using this for DAW recording and also live jam sessions over the internet.Zero issues and installation was easy.Software packaged with this is also excellent.\n\nfrom Amazon Customer September 01, 2016\n\nBetter than all other USD 99 interface\n\nI had the Steinberg UR12 for 2 months now, and it's just ok. But then I got this item as a replacement for a malfunctioning Gate. Due to the brand and lots of good reviews, i thought the Steinberg is the standard. The UMC202 outperforms the UR12! The gains are better, plugging guitars is amazing, and it has independent knob for output and headphones! Very low latency, and the Midas amp is good! Just download the driver from Music-Group website and that's it! Don't be fooled by brands! you're just paying for the name!\n\nfrom Amazon Customer August 09, 2016\n\nLove this thing!\n\nI used windows 10 explorer to download driver and no problem at all,just follow the instructions.I'm brand new at using this and \"Reaper\" DAW and recorded a song the morning I pulled it from the box,I'm really satisfied with this interface and the DAW .I Really like the Midas preamps!Personally I don't need anything more expensive.I like using less expensive equipment and making something that sounds great to me. Alot of times you can spend more but it don't get you more.\n\nfrom Juan S. August 29, 2016\n\nAwsome!\n\nWorks fantastic. I had been in the market for an audio interface to start streaming but I knew I was going to do so with my gf so this was our answer. Crystal clear gain, sound pickup and audio output. Great investment to any streamer as well as musicians since it has a 1/4in in for mics and instruments.\n\nfrom Nicolas Chaos April 22, 2016\n\nCost-efficient, elegant, workhorse.\n\nGood metal housing, smooth knobs, soft click switches, and inputs don't come loose accidentally. Best bit depth and sampling rate for an audio interface in its price range. Great features that make a balanced TRS audio for two monitors and headphones a breeze. I use this with the JBL 305 speakers and ath m50 headphones and absolutely love it. Make sure that you get the firmware and drivers from their website and check for deals before you buy. I got mine for $60 from behringer's website, so look to spend around $60-100 for this piece.\n\nfrom Matt Arens November 06, 2015\n\nPerfect.\n\nBest audio interface for $99, hands down. I use it to broadcast on the Internet while mixing live. HQ audio, no feedback whatsoever, and I still have 50% of room left on the gains. Lastly, no installation at all. Plug and play - literally. Behringer stays atop the audio equipment game for reasons like these.\n\nfrom Bill Davis/Steve Durson publishing December 23, 2015\n\nFive Stars\n\nlove it, love it, love it, What more can I say.

{"text": "Is Leonardo DiCaprio Engaged To Kelly Rohrbach? Let's Not Rush Things, People\n\nDespite tabloid rumors to the contrary, it looks like Leonardo DiCaprio is not engaged to Kelly Rohrbach, his girlfriend of four months. Of course, this news will either leave you feeling deliriously happy (yes! I still have a chance!) or devastatingly sad (I just want him to find true love!), but let's just take it for what it is: two people enjoying the beginnings of a fairly new relationship plagued by supermarket tabloid reports that they're already set to make a lifelong commitment to one another. And if there is one lesson to be learned from Taylor Swift's \"Out of the Woods\" or \"I Know Places\" (truly, the greatest manifestos of all celebrity relationships) it's that unfounded rumors like these can take the fire out of a relationship before it even really has the chance to begin. To put it simply? Let's not rush it.\n\nThe world began freaking out that long-time bachelor, short-time Titanic survivor DiCaprio was officially off the market thanks to an OK!Magazine insider who described, in detail, how the actor popped the question to the model.\n\n\"It wasn't planned. It just happened,\" the source said of the engagement, which allegedly took place at an Italian restaurant on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. \"They were enjoying a bottle of red wine and engrossed in conversation as usual — it's pretty obvious that they're in love from the way they're always touching and smiling.\"\n\nWhen the Wolf of Wall Street star revealed he \"wanted to spend the rest of his life with her,\" the model was \"shocked,\" the insider claimed, adding that once \"Leo convinced her that he meant it,\" Rohrbach \"agreed with a kiss.\" This would be cool and all, except for the fact that OK! is notorious for publishing untrue stories and GossipCop — known for shutting down fakeOK! rumors — allegedly got the real story from a DiCaprio source. One who claims that the engagement rumor, is, in a word, \"garbage.\"\n\nI mean, I get it. I have literally no relationship with the actor except for the time he filmed part of Wolf of Wall Street in my hometown and DiCaprio took a selfie of us and was the nicest guy ever and my life was made, but of course I still want the guy to settle down and be happy — if that's what he wants. But let's not get ahead of ourselves and throw the actor and his girlfriend of four months into a marriage right away. OK, OK?! Whether or not DiCaprio and Rohrbach will ever tie the knot, it's important that they, like any couple — especially any couple navigating the tricky spotlight of fame — live in the moment and not be bogged down by rumors urging them to speed up their relationship. It's a little foolhardy, to be honest.\n\nAnd at the end of the day, wouldn't the world like to hold onto single Leonardo DiCaprio for that much longer? Because, just like Rose at the end of Titanic, we'll never let go, Jack. *throws Heart of the Ocean into the water*", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "d0d95ed8-158f-4ef0-82e6-007d0ee9bdc0", "url": "https://www.bustle.com/articles/116386-is-leonardo-dicaprio-engaged-to-kelly-rohrbach-lets-not-rush-things-people"}

{"text": "Outdoors\n\nRoadside Attractions\n\nTreasure hunting in Skagit\n\nBy Trail Rat\n\nWednesday, September 19, 2018\n\nAs per the Lady of the House's request, we'd spent the entire morning blazing trails through the streets of Bellingham methodically patronizing every garage sale in sight. Although the material effectiveness of this operation couldn't be disputed, her hesitance to push the treasure-hunting process further afield threatened to unnecessarily curtail a good adventure.\n\nHenceforth and entirely of her own volition, she momentarily deferred navigational prerogative to me, her intrepid chauffeur.\n\nFueled by the lure of good deals in out-of-way places and the ever-insatiable lust for voluptuous countryside, it only took a couple hard right turns off Sehome Hill for us to galvanize a southbound leap.\n\nPeeling off the Interstate onto Riverside Drive in Mount Vernon, I merged fitfully into crushing throngs of Saturday afternoon traffic while my passenger kept her eyes peeled for sale signs, quickly noting a batch of them with urgent anticipation.\n\n\"Even among all these bottlenecks and big-box stores,\" I opined, \"don't you feel invigorated to be absorbed by the complexities of such an exotic streetscape?\"\n\n\"Hang a Ricky at the next light!\" the Lady interrupted. \"I'd rather invigorate myself at Goodwill.\"\n\nWe spent an hour fishing through the shelves in there. She got skunked, but I walked out with a pristine vintage copy of Native Son by Richard Wright and a science-fiction book featuring a furry yeti and a frightened mountaineer on the cover.\n\n\"He looks just like you,\" she said.\n\n\"Which one?\" I asked.\n\n\"Which one do you think?\" she smirked.\n\nFollowing more sale signs, we backtracked to College Way and headed east. And east. And east.\n\nFinally, almost near the end, I turned to follow a series of signs that guided us several fraught miles to a subdivision deep in the Highlands. The garage we walked into contained infinite treasures and we soon found ourselves beset upon by a pair of octogenarian antiquarians who bombarded us with charm, wisdom and stories to such spellbinding effect that we either had to buy something right away and leave or else remain trapped in their museum for hours.\n\nIt took a concerted burst of wheeling and dealing, but we stuck to our guns and escaped with a $3 candy bowl and a $5 hand-carved ebony beaver.\n\nEventually—after navigating through more unfamiliar forests and subdivisions—we emerged onto a two-lane highway that I recognized as Highway 9.\n\n\"North to Big Rock and loop back to Sedro-Woolley or south to Big Lake and re-emerge at Conway?\" I asked the Lady.\n\n\"Either way works for me,\" she smiled—not knowing we'd soon discover roadside art made from salvaged metal, an unexpected field full of blooming dahlias, and a historic bank for sale in the blink-and-you'll-miss-it town of Conway, and that our adventure was far from over.\n\n\"Wherever you go in Skagit, the magic is all-pervasive,\" she noted", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "d5c3594d-3f47-4341-92b9-117347e607d6", "url": "http://www.cascadiaweekly.com/cw/currents/treasure_hunting_in_skagit"}

The first song to be released from the Escovedo's next LP, The Crossing, \"Sonica USA\" also includes an appearance by one of his musical heroes, Wayne Kramer.\n\n\"Sonica USA\" serves as a guide of sorts to the trajectory that Escovedo's music has followed over the past four decades, name-checking everyone from proto-punks the Zeros to Public Enemy and Kramer's seminal group, the MC5. The chugging guitar makes for a timely homage to the Detroit rockers, who celebrate the 50th anniversary of their album Kick Out the Jams this year, but it also hits close to home in the current political climate as the first glimpse of a concept record focused on the immigrant experience in the United States.\n\nThe Crossing will be released September 14th, and its storyline follows the intersecting lives of two characters – one from Italy, the other from Mexico – as they wrestle with the idea of cultural identity and confront racism in the United States.

{"text": "If memory serves right, the last time Apple invited non-Apple centric Youtubers was at the launch of the Watch\nMaybe this WWDC really is big\n\n'Big' it was, but I think I — and maybe others — were expecting a small amount of monolithic changes. Instead, I would summarise WWDC 2016 as being a lot of new changes/features across the small-to-huge spectrum, spanning Apple's entire expanse. I had a feeling Apple would focus on only three of their four OSes (my guess was tvOS would've been skipped) but that wasn't the case. Here's my thoughts in a rough chronological order:\n\nwatchOS = 3.0\n\nwatchOS's redesign is now a way more familiar for iOS users.\n\nWhen Stacey demoed watchOS's new features she did her job like a pro. This was her first appearance at the WWDC keynote and she didn't look like it at all. She delivered with confidence and passion.\n\nThe segment of watchOS 3 dedicated to users in a wheelchair filled me with joy. 'Time to stand up' changed to 'Time to roll'. It's such an Apple thing to care for differently abled users even though they make up a minority of their user base. To add to the joy, I loved the icon they showcased 2 while talking about these changes: A person in a wheelchair leaning forward. I thought that was a positive, cheerful and an all-around excellent icon.\n\nThe Watch is being pitched to become a more integral part of your life and watchOS 3 shows all signs of that happening.\n\ntvOS++ //version: 10\n\nI don't have a lot to say here except maybe about Eddy Cue's demeanour. It's probably just me but Cue seemed a little sombre? It may just be the time constraint but he just seemed off his game, somehow. Eddy's…cue also seemed a little odd when the presenter before him said 'the one and only Eddy Cue'. The App Store bloomed under Schiller and Cue's caught flack for his goofiness in his past presentations. I could just be correlating here. Onwards…\n\nlet macOS = copy(&OS_X)\n\nDid anyone else notice the fact that Federighi was wearing what seemed like the same deep-blue coloured shirt as the WWDC marketting background?\nHis performance was flawless and he seemed to be in control throughout. The man and his words carried weight and authority — almost like Tim Cook. Apart from a little slip-up at the very end of his iOS segment (something to the effect of '…but…we do have one more thing' which then led to a video for iOS; I call it a slip-up because 'one more thing' holds meaning in Apple's culture and I think a passing expression on Federighi's face revealed that he realised his mistake) I think he did a terrific job.\n\nI haven't seen people take too highly to system-wide tabs on macOS but I think those people are also the ones who own iMacs. I own a 13-inch retina MacBook Pro and I use tabs all the time and everywhere I possibly can. Maybe there's some correlation between bigger screens and appreciation of tabs?\n\nI, and people on Twitter, made the apparent Sierra-Siri connection. Note that the Federighi was on such a schedule he didn't even talk about which key he was pressing to trigger Siri.\n\nWhen Twitter came to know about Apple's new filesystem — APFS — there were a lot of John Siracusa pictures (ding ?). I'm very interested in knowing more.\n\nVeterans understandably dislike the change of name but I think new-timers — like me — should find no problem. 'macOS' rolls off my keystrokes because the majority of my typing throughout the day is Swift code and it relies heavily on Camel Case. I like the new name. OS X seemed, to me, vintage and classy; macOS is modern and crisp.\n\niOS = 10.0 + growth(SIRI + 3DTouch)\n\nThere's a lot to talk about here, let's start at a meta level. If you recall, when Craig Federighi spoke about iOS 7 at WWDC 2013 he said it's like a new phone but one that you instantly know how to use. iOS 10 is a major overhaul to the iOS design and interaction paradigm. Going from iOS 6 to iOS 7 I knew my way around the OS. With iOS 10 something as instrumental as 'Slide to unlock' has been re-thought. Now, I need to put in conscious effort to not press the power-button to wake my iPhone since the display is already on by the time I pick it up — following tradition would just have me put the phone back to sleep.\n\nObviously there's a long way to go with the Betas until (presumably) September so I'll tone down the iOS-specific commentary. Before I start with my observations, I'd like you to keep a key detail in mind, referenced from Neil Cybart's tweet:\n\nLess home button, more swiping.\n\nWill be very useful when the new iPhone in 2017 lacks the home button.\n\nIt's important to keep an iPhone sans-home button in context when reviewing iOS 10. On with the observations:\n\niOS 10: 10 new features. My feeling was: Apple has advanced so much over the years on all axes and yet the 'No big deal, just 10 new features' narrative that Jobs pioneered lives on through Apple keynotes. I thought it was an homage to a legacy.\n\nPreviously, iOS housed Siri and 3D Touch, now iOS is driven by Siri and 3D Touch. The new visual language seems to be all 3D Touch driven. I think it may even solve a lot of the discoverability problems 3D Touch faced until now where people just didn't know where 3D Touch could be used.\n\nFollowing closely with my previous point, iOS 10 seems to be laying a lot of groundwork for the future (the same way Auto Layout did for iPad multi-tasking) with 3D Touch and Siri. This is where, I think, Apple is preparing users for an iPhone without the home button.\n\nThe redesigned News icon seems native to a 3D Touch environment. (Here's hope we get News in India).\n\n\"Hello strutting…okay?\": Bozoma Saint John has made a bigger splash on the Internet than Apple Music — the app she was on stage to demo — or even Eddy Cue. The instant I saw her walk on stage, I noticed the pink she wore and instantly thought of Eddy Cue's iconic pink shirt. Further, John made a few comments along the lines of 'I can jam along but I know you are developers so you can explore [said feature] at your disposal' 1 and that, to me, was a clear nod to last year's terrible Apple Music presentation.\nI, personally, wasn't a big fan of John's segment but it's hard to argue against its brilliance.\n\niMessage, Apple Maps and Photos all seem to embody a general direction of Apple doing everything others have done and executing it in true Apple fashion. The word 'humane' keeps coming to mind whenever I think of the iOS segment. Everything from iMessage animations to the little demo of auto-generated videos from your photo library (I think they were called Memories) seemed to embody Apple's understanding of the human nature and empathise with and build for human emotions.\nAnother example is Federighi seemed to deliberately not use Google-speak such as 'contextually-aware-deep-machine-neural-yabberjabber-vector-accelerated-learning' and instead stick with the humane, 'Siri', instead.\n\nmiscellany()\n\nRight before WWDC, I was contemplating last year's WWDC — the Apple Music segment in particular — and how non-developer oriented it was. I made the connection with WWDC from two years ago where Tim Cook said 'and for those of you who don't know, the SDK is the Software Development Kit…' and then with Federighi saying — in the same keynote, after announcing Swift — 'You know how many people are sitting at hime thinking 'what in the heck are these guys talking about?''.\nMaybe WWDC truly is, by a large margin, no longer a developer-only event. Apple has data on how many non-developers watch WWDC the numbers by which they exceed developers. Maybe a growing number of non-developer, non-tech people was exactly what made Apple justify last year's Music segment. Not the make excuses for its turd-iness but I think it's a little detail the tech-folk should keep in mind while judging WWDC.\n(I think Cook even mentioned this time: 'millions watching at home').\n\nI was actually jumping around like a lunatic in my little apartment when Cook announced Playgrounds for iPad. My theory on the WWDC marketting turned out right too. Apple wants more developers for its platforms because it has more platforms than ever and it needs to make more money from its existing customer base as it pushes into services. And on that note, Apple's pushing discoverability of developer's apps very heavily too. From prompts for downloading apps through iMessages, adding (poorly designed) share buttons to 3D Touch app-shortcuts, to announcements such as a new way to live stream your game play to compatible clients announced at the State of the Union for extending the reach of said game.\n\nI was very happy with this year's WWDC. My first take on the iOS redesign isn't entirely positive but I realise a big part of that is because I'm so used to the traditional iOS 7 design. I keep posting my thoughts on the iOS 10 beta on Twitter and there's more good than bad but I'll reserve judgement on it until later.\n\nI feel like I am closer to WWDC 2016's target audience that WWDCs of the past. My time as a Swift programmer (or with any modern programming language, for that matter) barely scratches the surface. I can't entirely operate Xcode's debugger but working with closures has me grinning internally.

The data stored with the CIDR will be fully protected and secured and will not be shared with any other government or private organisation,\" Nanawati said, adding that the UID is an \"acknowledged existence\" for common man programme with the aim to improve quality of service and better access to the citizens of the country.\n\nThe Election Commission of India has given full support to the UID project and election commissioners have been allowed to become members of the UID team in various states in the country. \"The UID programme is voluntary in nature and not mandatory like the Election Commission identification programme, This is an area of major concern as in an election card a photo provided by the voter can also work. In the UID card, the person has to appear physically for the identity card. The election ID card costs Rs 10 and the UID programme should try to bring down the cost of the UID card,\" said Deputy Election Commissioner Alok Shukla.\n\nMore than 150 experts from India and abroad participated in the workshop.\n\nFrench connection\n\nIndia's UID programme, considered one of the biggest projects happening in the world, has captured global imagination and attention. \"It is the world's most challenging and ambitious transformation programme,\" said Jérôme Bonnafont, Ambassador of France in India while inaugurating the Unique Identity workshop.\n\n\"France has in the recent years successfully launched its Unique Social security number project. Our expertise in implementing the project can help India's ambitious project of creating the world's largest biometric database and authentication,\" Bonnafont said.\nAccording to Samiti spokesman Roop Singh, the march started from the college ground at Hindaun in Karauli and Bainsla is accompanied by thousands of his supporters. \"The government doesn't seem keen on holding any further talks and therefore we have no option but to intensify our protests. We will take overnight stay at Pipalkhera Patoli and will proceed towards the highway by 11 am tomorrow,\" said Bainsla.\n\nKarauli Collector Neeraj K Pawan said proper security arrangements are in place to ensure that that march is peaceful. In view of the Gujjars' march, the authorities today suspended rail traffic on Delhi-Mumbai route for a few minutes as a precautionary measure. Later, Bainsla assured the government that they will not disrupt rail traffic in the state. However, the railway authorities are not taking any chances and additional forces have been deployed at all the railway stations in Gujjar dominated areas.\n\nEarlier, the talks between a 13-member Gujjar delegation and the state government broke down late last night, following which Gujjar leaders Harprasad and Roop Singh warned of intensifying the agitation. Harprasad even suggested that the Gujjar stir may take a violent turn. Interestingly, it is not only the Gujjars who have lost patience with the government the latter, too, seems fed up with Bainsla's threats. Energy Minister Jitendra Singh, who is the government's intermediary in negotiations with the Gujjars, said, \"They want 5 per cent quota in five minutes, which is not possible. Even the President of India cannot do it.\" He categorically ruled out any further invitation from the government to Bainsla for talks. \"We will not send anyone now; at least till there is some legal solution in sight.\"\n\nDuring the talks, the Gujjars asked the government to provide them 5 per cent quota within the constitutional limit of 50 per cent reservation.\n\nThe state government, on the other hand, stuck to its stand of increasing 5 per cent vacancies to safeguard the Gujjars' interests till the legal tangle is resolved.\n\nThe government doesn't seem keen on holding any further talks and therefore we have no option but to intensify our protests. We will take overnight stay at Pipalkhera Patoli and will proceed towards the highway by 11 am tomorrow\n\n— Kirori Singh Bainsla, Gujjar leader\n\nThey want 5 per cent quota in five minutes, which is not possible. Even the President of India cannot do it.\n\nNew Delhi, April13\nThe Nepal Government's decision to scrap a deal with India to print 'smart' Nepali passports has not come as a big surprise to India though New Delhi regrets that the issue has been politicised in the Himalayan nation.\n\n\"It's the decision of a sovereign government and we respect it… however, we regret that it has been unnecessarily politicised and confidential communication between the Nepal Government and the Indian Embassy has been publicised,\" official sources here said.\n\nThe sources said it was quite clear that Maoists in Nepal were once again trying to whip up anti-India sentiments with the larger objective of embarrassing the Madhav Kumar Nepal Government.\n\nIt was at Nepal's initiative that an agreement was signed between the Security Printing and Minting Corporation of India (SPMCIL) and the Foreign Ministry of Nepal on March 26 for printing nearly three million machine-readable passports for the next five years to replace the current handwritten ones to meet the norms of the International Civil Aviation Organisation.\n\nUnder the agreement, New Delhi had agreed to supply the machine-readable passport booklets through its government undertaking at a concessional price as a gesture of goodwill and in keeping with the friendly relations between the two countries. India also agreed to provide, at its cost, technical assistance, which included supply of software and hardware equipment, installation of these equipment at the central passport office in Kathmandu and training of Nepalese officials.\n\nThe sources said the arrangement agreed with the Nepal Government would have allowed it to issue machine-readable passports by early June. To ensure this, the SPMCIL had already initiated action.\n\nNew Delhi, April 13\nThe snowballing row over the ownership of the Indian Premier League (IPL) Kochi team involving Minister of State for External Affairs Shashi Tharoor has raised serious doubts over his continuation in the government.\n\nThe controversy-ridden minister's fate hangs in balance as the public spat between IPL Commissioner Lalit Modi and Tharoor has acquired a political hue with the BJP demanding Tharoor's dismissal while an embarrassed Congress first jumped to defend him and then backed off within hours to distance itself from this entire episode.\n\nThe minister is in the dock for having taken undue interest in the IPL auctioning of the Kochi team in which his 'friend' Sunanda Pushar is said to have been given a free equity valued at Rs 70 crores.\n\nWith Parliament set to commence on Thursday and the BJP upping the ante, Congress president Sonia Gandhi took stock of the situation today.\n\nTharoor's senior, External Affairs Minister SM Krishna and Rajiv Shukla, a Congress MP who is also a BCCI spokesperson, met Gandhi this morning to brief her. Although there is no official word on what transpired at this meeting, there is growing impatience in the Congress over Tharoor's habit of courting controversy and embarrassing the party.\n\nA final call on this matter will be taken after Prime Minister Manmohan Singh returns from his overseas trip. Till then, the party thinks it is prudent to wait for a clear picture to emerge to see if Tharoor has indeed committed financial and political impropriety.\n\n\"The Congress has nothing to do with this entire matter,\" Janardhan Dwivedi, Congress media chairperson, declared this evening, hours after his junior colleague, party spokesperson Shakeel Ahmed had justified Tharoor's interest in the IPL Kochi team. \"Nothing unwarranted has happened....As an MP from Kerala, it is natural that he should help out somebody for a team belonging to his home state,\" he said. Stating that the party would not pass any judgement on this issue, Dwivedi said, it was for the minister to explain and the government to look into it.\n\nWhile the Congress decided to distance itself from the latest Tharoor controversy, the BJP quickly stepped in to demand that the Prime Minister sack the junior External Affairs Minister.\n\nBJP spokesperson Ravi Shankar Prasad even demanded the Central Bureau of Investigation be asked to probe the alleged \"misuse\" of authority by Tharoor to \"secure\" investment made by his 'friend' Sunanda Pushkar in the IPL Kochi team.\n\n\"I am talking of the CPL - corruption premier league. What the BCCI does, we are not concerned. But we are concerned with the conduct of minister, a man who remains permanently in controversies and now in the quicksand of corruption. This is a serious issue,\" Prasad added.\n\nUnder attack from all sides, Tharoor issued an official statement to counter the allegations over the ownership of the Kochi team.\n\nHe admitted that stakeholder Sunanda Pushkar, who said to be his fiancée, was his close friend and that \"various attempts were made by Modi and others to pressure the consortium members to abandon their bid in favour of another city in a different state\". Tharoor's aide Jacob Joseph, who also joined the fight, went as far as to describe Modi as a \"convicted drug\npeddler\".\nAICC general secretary Rahul Gandhi has chosen the BSP heartland of Ambedkar Nagar to address a public rally and launch 10 'Sandesh Yatras' to mark 125 years of the party's establishment. The yatras will cover every assembly constituency of the state during the next nine months.\n\nThe BSP, on the other hand, has chosen the day to launch its countrywide offensive to expose the \"anti-Dalit mindset\" of the Congress. According to Mayawati, an example of this mindset was the introduction of the Women's Reservation Act, which she feels is meant to keep the Dalit women out of active politics.\n\nAnnouncing the nationwide protest demanding quota within quota during her March 15 rally, Mayawati did not mince words to hit out at Sonia and Rahul for taking the credit for the advancement of women.\n\nThe BSP holds a rally on this day every year. This year following the call for nationwide protest meetings on Ambedkar Jayanti, the party is gearing up in a big way and Ambedkar Nagar is the venue for a major public meeting where several senior leaders and cabinet ministers are expected to address the gathering.\n\nPolitcally the district is considered a Dalit bastion as all five assembly seats and the lone Lok Sabha seat is held by the BSP and the party has won every significant election from the constituency.\n\nNow Rahul has chosen the district to launch the party's mission 2012 to mobilise his party and end the BSP's monopoly in the district.\n\nObviously, Mayawati would not take the teaser lying down. Fireworks are expected tomorrow when the two parties battle it out for the Dalit\nvotes.\n\nNew Delhi, April 13\nUnion Home Minister P Chidambaram has advised all Naxal-affected states to choke the red rebels' economic lifeline, which helps them buy weapons and run their propaganda machinery.\n\nAfter the massacre of 75 Central Reserve Police Force men by the Maoists in Dantewada, Chhattisgarh, last week, Chidambaram is an aggressive mood to tackle the Naxal menace. Besides intensifying the Operation Green Hunt in the entire tribal belt of the Naxal-infested states, the security forces and the local police should attempt to cut the sources of funds available to the Maoists, Chidambaram has reportedly advised.\n\nThe Naxal movement in the Red Corridor from the Nepal Border to Andhra Pradesh is now an organised extortion business. The Naxals call it \"levy\". The Red Corridor passes through thick forests and hilly terrain of Bihar, Jharkhand, West Bengal, Orissa, Chhattisgarh and some districts of Maharashtra.\n\nAs per a general estimate of the police and security agencies, the Maoist groups are collecting several thousand crores of rupees as levy in the Red Corridor from public and private sector industrial units, traders, contractors, transporters, petrol station owners and government employees.\n\nAt several places, the levy is also being paid to the Maoists by politicians and policemen for their own protection. \"We need funds to run our large andolan\" is the reply you get when you ask Maoist leaders why do they extort money when it is a people's movement.\n\n\"Most of the Maoist groups are no longer operating for ideology but for extortion,\" Alok Raj, Deputy Inspector General of Police of the Central Reserve Police Force, told The Tribune from Ranchi. The CRPF is the main paramilitary organisation engaged in special operations against the Naxals in all Naxal-affected states.\n\nMoney collected by the Maoists is also utilised by them for giving \"salary\" to cadre workers in jungles as well as those who run \"urban cells\".\n\nA large amount of this money is reportedly spent on buying arms and ammunition from local and international sources, including terrorist outfits in India and adjoining countries. Leaders get salaries for procuring rations, running military training camps, enrolling members and collecting intelligence about the \"enemy\" security forces. In Jharkhand and Chhattisgarh, many top leaders of the CPI (Maoist) are using large funds to enjoy a luxurious life. Many of them have invested money in various business ventures such as travel agencies, transport trucks and dumpers in mining areas, and courier shops.\n\nSome Naxal leaders have even parked their money with the traders, contractors and transporters from whom they collect the levy. Besides doing extortion business, the Naxal splinter groups are indulging in kidnappings, looting and narcotics trade, which itself is reported to be yielding them over Rs 500 crore annually.\n\nThe police has seized \"levy cards\" in various states. These cards give details of the exact amount of money that is supposed to be paid. It varies from five to 10 per cent, depending on the cost of the project that the contractor is handling, or the annual turnover of the mining company. In some cases, receipts are issued for \"donation\".\n\nOfficials of various government departments like forest, public works, engineering and roads and teachers and general stores have also been paying protection money to the Naxals.\n\nLevy collection by the Maoists poses a serious threat to the state's development. For example, the Jharkhand police in 2009 registered 52 levy related cases and recovered Rs 12.56 lakh \"levy money\" during the raids. In 2008, the levy amount of Rs 23.06 lakh was recovered from the Naxals. These amounts are just a tip of the iceberg.\n\nNew Delhi, April 13\nThe government will recruit about 2,000 ex-servicemen specialised in commando and jungle warfare tactics to impart cutting-edge training to the CRPF personnel.\n\nThe recruitment of these ex-servicemen, which will begin next month, assumes significance as 75 para-military personnel were massacred by the Maoists in Chhattisgarh's Dantewada recently, raising questions on the operational strategies of the force. Those servicemen, who retired as Sepoy and Havaldar, will be drawn from the Army regiments and Corps like infantry, mechanised infantry, armoured, artillery, intelligence and engineering Corps for the purpose.\n\nIn order to ensure that the CRPF personnel get the best training, the government has made it mandatory for these ex-servicemen to be trained in specialised courses like 'Ghatak' commando training, weapons, the IED and bomb disposal, dog handling and the counter insurgency and jungle warfare (CIJW). It is also mandatory for these ex-servicemen to have served in the insurgency-hit areas and had stints at Army training schools.\n\n\"These men will be deputed to train our personnel at the various CIJW schools in the country which are facing shortage of trainers. It is a fact that a good trainer can only bring out the best in an individual,\" a senior CRPF officer said. The ex-servicemen will be recruited on a contractual basis for five to seven years on a total remuneration of Rs 12,625 plus other incentives.\n\nInitially 1,950 men will be recruited and the numbers could be enhanced in the future. The all-India recruitment will begin in May and would finish by June after which the ex-servicemen would undergo initial training and briefing before they start the job, the officer said. A board of senior CRPF and Home Ministry officials will conduct the \"open rally\" recruitment for which an applicant should be under 40 years of age. There will not be any criteria for physical and educational background of the ex-service personnel.\n— PTI\nThe hospital on the EM bypass near Garia, South 24 Parganas, allegedly refused admission to the injured people without getting the medical charges in advance.\n\nLocals alleged that six injured persons, including a two-year-old boy, who were kept waiting on the hospital premises, succumbed to their injuries. This enraged the victims' family members, passers-by and other locals, who ransacked the hospital and set fire to its furniture and medical equipment.\n\nAll traffic on the busy the EM bypass remained suspended for five hours in the morning.\n\nWhen the police arrived, they too were pelted with stones. Failing to control the mob, the police fired several rounds in the air, injuring a middle-aged man. Prior to the firing, the police had tried to control the mob with batons and teargas shells.\n\nThe state minister in charge of Sunderbans development, Kanti Ganguly, too, rushed to the hospital and pacified the mob with the assurance that the guilty hospital staff and doctors would be strongly dealt with.\n\nHe said as per the Supreme Court's recent order, no hospital could refuse admission to any seriously injured person even if the latter did not have adequate funds to make an advance deposit. He said the government would institute an inquiry into the incident and take necessary legal action against the errant doctors and the hospital staff.\n\nThe incident occurred around 10 am when a matador carrying at least 12 persons, including women and children, was involved in a head-on collision with a truck on the EM bypass. The truck driver escaped, leaving the vehicle on the road. The injured were taken to the nearby private hospital by passers-by. Denied admission, six of the injured succumbed to their injuries in the private hospital.\n\nNew Delhi, April 13\nMaternal deaths in India could be more than what the government estimates have been projecting.\n\nWhile the Ministry of Health, at the end of five years of implementation of the National Rural Health Mission yesterday, claimed the MMR (maternal mortality ratio- maternal deaths per one lakh live births) was 254, experts carrying out simultaneous assessment of the mission say the MMR could be anywhere 0between 325 and 350 -- not a very happy situation as it indicates poor progress under the NRHM.\n\nThe government claims are based on the latest Sample Registration System (SRS), the dual reporting system used to provide reliable annual estimates of births and deaths at both the state and national level. But the SRS data is under question from demographic experts who say it is too small to provide correct estimates of maternal deaths in a huge country like India. Another apprehension the experts are voicing is that the SRS data is government's own data generated by a survey conducted by the Registrar General of India.\n\nThe question demographers are asking therefore is --- \"how fair is it for the government to use its own estimates to assess the progress of its own programme (NRHM in this case)?\"\n\nWith no agreement on the real MMR estimates, the Ministry of Health is now learnt to be deliberating on the issue to arrive at some \"adjustment of figures\".\n\nDr S. Ram, Director, Indian Institute of Population Sciences (IIPS), Mumbai, the nodal agency for the ongoing evaluation of NRHM's progress since its launch in 2005, today confirmed to The Tribune that the MMR as projected by the SRS was on the lower side. \"Our estimate is in the range of 325 and 350. Also, the MMR of 254 per one lakh live births is not consistent with other programme indicators under the NRHM, like the immunisation progress, institutional deliveries, antenatal and postnatal care for mothers. If the SRS claim of reduced MMR is to be believed, we have to have corresponding gains in vital indicators of maternal health across India. Those are not there.\"\n\nThe government is aware of the contradiction in MMR claims and is in the process of arriving at a corrected estimate. The Tribune has learnt that a committee headed by Union Health Secretary Sujatha Rao is working on this issue.\n\nMeanwhile, another IIPS expert involved in NRHM evaluation whose report will be released any time now said the MMR of 325 to 350 per one lakh live births was based on actual maternal health indicators as revealed by the National Family Health Survey and the District Level Health Survey.\n\nGuwahati, April 13\nThe Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) has indicted 15 MLAs of Meghalaya, including the then Speaker and two Assembly staffers, for receiving travelling allowance (TA) on the basis of fake documents that resulted in an inflated payment of Rs 1.67 crore.\n\nThe latest CAG report for the financial year ending on March 31, 2009, mentioned that those MLAs were invited for a one-day visit to British Parliament on October 9, 2006, on the condition that the expenditure would be borne by the Meghalaya government. However, in their expenditure statement they have shown to have visited Paris, Rome and Amsterdam also during October 11 to 20, 2006 in addition to one day's visit to British Parliament.\n\nThe excess payment taken by the MLAs was detected after a scrutiny of travel documents in November 2008.\n\nThe legislators resorted to outrageous manipulation of TA bills. For example, as per TA bills the MLAs delegation visited Pisa (Rome) on October 15, 2006, for which they claimed taxi fare of Rs 45,000 per person/taxi for a distance of 950 km (both ways). But tour operator's record says they only visited Florence on that day and distance between Rome Hotel and Florence is 568 Km.\n\nFourteen of the delegation submitted TA claims at uniform rate of Rs 12.10 lakh and the rest three for Rs 11.06 lakh, Rs 12.06 lakh and Rs 12.08 lakh and were paid during November 2007 to February 2008. All members of the team claimed at the rate of Rs 4.55 lakh, Rs 0.67 lakh and Rs 5.94 lakh per person as airfare for (a) Delhi-Amsterdam-London sector, Paris-Rome-Amsterdam-Delhi sector (b) Euro Star Train fare from London to Paris and (c) taxi fare for local journeys abroad respectively besides domestic air fare, daily allowance for foreign tour, personnel incidental etc.\n\nThe CAG found out that airfare at the rate of Rs 4.55 lakh was claimed by the members of the team on the basis of certificate issued by a Shillong-based travel agency 'A'. But the air tickets and itinerary attached to the TA claims showed that these were actually purchased from another Shillong-based travel agency 'B' which informed that they had arranged for air tickets for the 17-member delegation for the said sectors at the rates ranging between Rs 52,234 and Rs 70,416 per person and that the fare of Rs 4.55 lakh claimed by members was not shown in the itinerary given by them.\n\nEach of the members claimed Rs 6.61 lakh as Euro Star train fair from London to Paris (Rs 0.67 lakh) and taxi fare for local journeys abroad (Rs 5.94 lakh). However, evidence in support of rail, taxi fare etc. were not produced with TA claims. But tour operators claimed Rs 68,998 per person from 16 members and Rs 64,634 from one member for arrangements viz, hotel accommodation, local journeys in abroad.\n\"We have been alerted about one more source of radiation in\nMayapuri. It is smaller in size than the earlier one,\" Dr B Bhattacharya, member National Disaster Management Authority\n(NDMA), said.\n\nFour experts from Bhabha Atomic Research Centre, 15 from NDMA along with one expert from Atomic Energy Regulatory Board will start work in the area by tomorrow morning, he said.\n\nEarlier on April 8, a radiation leak was reported from Mayapuri industrial area after a scrap dealer and his four employees suffered burn injuries and fell unconscious after coming in contact with a mysterious shining object. Another person from a neighbouring shop was also affected.\n— PTI\n\nNew Delhi, April 13\nThat night around 14 years ago, it really rained arms in some remote villages of West Bengal.\n\nThe December 17, 1995, incident - known as the Purulia arms drop case - still haunts security agencies. A foreign aircraft had come and gone after dropping weapons and ammunition. The episode remains the most serious breach of Indian air space and national security till date.\n\nThe arrest of a Dutch national, Kim Peter Davy (47), one of the main accused in this sensational case, in Denmark on Sunday, and his likely extradition to India soon, have raised hopes of uncovering the dark chapters of one of its kind incident.\n\nDavy alias Niels Holcks alias Neils Christian Nielsen was arrested by Denmark's Ministry of Justice after it agreed to extradite him following requests made by India many years ago. Davy, the most important key to the mystery, has been suspected to be a member of a secret Hindu cult, Ananda Marga.\n\nDavy had disappeared from Mumbai's Sahar international airport soon after the aircraft, from which the arms and ammunition were dropped at Purulia, was grounded.\n\nDespite the passage of years, which witnessed arrest of many foreign nationals, court drama and subsequently their mysterious release, the incident is wrapped in secrecy and not many details are known about the case. Nor is there much consensus regarding the chain of events and the evidence in question. Experts differ on various counts.\n\nEven the provisions of the Right to Information Act have failed to get 'inside information' to solve the mystery. Two years ago, the Central Information Commission dismissed an application seeking information on complicity of government officers in the Purulia arms drop case after taking into consideration the CBI's plea that such disclosure could impede the prosecution process.\n\nOn a RTI application of a Jammu resident BR Manhas, the CBI's Joint-Director had argued that the case, which was still pending, had \"international ramifications with direct bearing on security\" and, hence, disclosure of such information were exempted under the provisions of the RTI Act.\n\nHowever, the CBI, which painstakingly tried to draw the case's picture after filing the chargesheet in a Kolkata court, has so far maintained that the arms were meant for the Ananda Margis. Some believe that these were for the Naxalites. The CBI had filed the charge-sheet within 86 days after completing investigations conducted in 22 countries.\n\nAfter Kim Davy's arrest in Denmark on Sunday, the designated CBI court at Bichar Bhavan at Bankshall Court in Kolkata has once again started preparations for re-opening the case. Interestingly, the case will be re-started six years after Peter Bleach, a British national, was released following efforts by the UK government.\n\nWhat had surprised everyone then was the fact that Peter Bleach, during investigations, was found to be an alleged arms dealer and former British intelligence officer. And London making special efforts to get him out of Indian prison spoke of his 'high value' for the British.\n\n\"Kim Davy was the sender and the receiver was Ananda Marg,\" a top CBI officer here said \"This is what we had gathered from Bleach's laptop,\" he added. It is believed that the 'target' was the three-storied building of Ananda Marg at Bansgarh.\n\nIt all began on the night of December 17, 1995, when a huge quantity of arms and ammunition, parachutes, anti-tank grenades and rocket launchers were dropped in wooden boxes from a Latvian Antonov-26 aircraft in the Parulia district.\n\nThe transport plane, belonging to M's Carol Air Services, began its journey from Riga in Bulgaria. After stopovers, including one at Karachi, it dropped the consignment in Jhalda, Ghatanga, Belamu, Maramu villages. After that, it flew over Dhanbad, Kolkata and went to Phuket in Thailand.\n\nSeveral days later, the plane re-entered Indian airspace, got itself refueled at Chennai, and when it took off, it was intercepted by the Indian Air Force's Russian MiG-21 fighters, and forced to land in Mumbai, and its five-member Latvian crew, including Captain Alexander Klichine, the 44-year-old pilot, Igor Moskvitine (navigator), Oleg Gaidach (co-pilot), Yevgeni Antimenko (cargo operator) and Igor Timmerman (flight engineer), and Peter Bleach, alleged arms dealer and former British intelligence officer, were captured.\n\nThe kingpin Kim Davy, against whom an Interpol Red Corner was issued later, escaped. While the true motive of the operation remains shrouded in mystery and conjecture, it is believed that the arms were intended for Ananda Margis, but proof of this could not be established.\nNow when the state is slated to go to the polls after six months, Bihar Chief Minister has planned to embark on 'Vishwas yatra' from the end of this month to gauze the mood of the electorate whether they were satisfied with his performance or not.\n\nDisclosing his plans to mediapersons here, the Chief Minister said he would cover all the districts and personally review the progress of various developmental and welfare schemes initiated by his government.\n\nAccording to him, it will be a kind of spot verification of the works during his first tenure, which will come to an end by November this year.\n\"Around 40 lakh pilgrims have so far taken bath in the river Ganga and the number of devotees is expected to cross the mark of 50 lakh by this evening,\" DIG Kumbh Mela Alok Sharma said. No untoward incident has been reported from anywhere, Sharma added. Har-Ki-Pauri and other bathing ghats in Haridwar and Rishikesh were flooded with pilgrims, while police personnel were helping the aged and handicapped. Considering the huge rush of pilgrims for the last royal bath of Mesh Sankranti tomorrow, traffic regulations have already been put in place.\n\nThe three-month-long mela which began on January 14 with Makar Sankranti, would culminate on April 14.\n— PTI\n\"The state government has failed to consider the relevant aspects for the purpose of premature release of a life convict. The GO is therefore, arbitrary, whimsical and is violative of Articles 14 and 21 of the Constitution,\" she said, in a writ petition.\n\nThe petitioner said the state had heavily relied on the observations of the Prison Advisory Board and ignored the observations of the Supreme Court, in similar cases.\n\n\"Supreme Court Justice KT Thomas, one of the judges who heard the Rajiv assassination case, had observed: 'Nalini realised only at Sriperumbudur that Dhanu was going to kill Rajiv. Perhaps that may be a fact. But, she would not have dared to retreat from the scene as she was tucked into the tentacles of the conspiracy octopus from where it was impossible for a woman like Nalini to escape' the judge had observed,\" Nalini pointed out in her petition.\n\nAnother ground for rejection that her mother and brother were living in an area where many important persons lived and her release would create law and order problem was unreasonable, she said. They would be willing to shift their present residence to some other locality, as desired by the police in the event of a premature release, she said.\n\nChennai, April 13\nThe Southern Railway today launched a 'philately exhibition on wheels', which will go to all major cities across south India showcasing the history, growth and heritage of the Indian Railways.\n\nThe weeklong exhibition would cover major cities of all the six divisions of the Southern Railway, its General Manager Deepak Krishnan, said. He said the exhibition train, comprising three AC coaches covering 1900 km, would display 'very rare and unique' collection of stamps and cancellation covers by renowned philatelist Mohammed Mujibullah, Heritage Assistant, the Eastern Railway.\n\nThe stamps portrayed important events like developments of railroad, horse-drawn carriages, birth of steam locomotives, metro trains, monorails, super speed trains, among others, he said. Mujibullah said the collection comprised of several stamps from 156 countries, including that of rare postal currency of the US, and the exhibition was expected to enter into Guinness book of world records.\n— PTI\n\nOil factory blaze\nMumbai: A fire broke out in an oil factory in a village at Shahpur block in neighbouring Thane district in the wee hours today, following which houses in 2 km radius were evacuated.\nTen water tankers and five fire engines from fire units of nearby Bhiwandi, Thane, Kalyan, Ulhansnagar, Navi Mumbai cities have been rushed to the four-decade old Liberty Oil Mills in Bamne village where the fire broke out.\n— PTI\n\nKaruna govt's no to Bt Brinjal\nChennai: The Tamil Nadu government today said it would not allow the cultivation of genetically modified brinjal and it would stand by its assurance to farmers and environmentalists on the issue. Chief Minister M Karunanidhi assured a delegation of scientists and environmentalists that his government would not allow Bt brinjal cultivation.\n\"It is the final word. We will not allow Bt Brinjal,\" Agriculture Minister Veerapandi S Arumugam informed the Assembly. The Bt brinjal issue was firmly opposed by farmers associations, NGOs and a section of scientists and health experts on the ground that genetically modified vegetable would have adverse effect on human health and soil fertility.\n— TNS", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "a08bf9e1-f258-41d1-b6ea-93a7ca6c9e14", "url": "https://www.tribuneindia.com/2010/20100414/nation.htm"}
{"text": " 8 BRIEFINGS prices\", zero import duty for import of raw materials for foundries, ban on foundry commodities in commodity trading and reduction of interest rate on working capital for foundries and engineering units. Selling into China Ford Motor Company, the largest US- based auto group, reported a 16.4% rise in sales in China during its first quarter, compared to a year ago. Ford said that 42,746 units had been sold in China, helped by introducing its S-Max and Focus models, and the development of its auto-financing business. Sales of Ford's high-end models, such as Jaguar and Land Rover, jumped 30% to over 4,000 units. Ford's joint venture with Chongqing and Mazda, the Changan Ford Mazda Automobile Company, reported a 19% increase in sales in the first quarter. Ford said it plans to increase production capacity by the end of 2007. New Molybdenum Smelter for Korea A new Molybdenum smelter has been opened in Korea, the world's fifth- largest steelmaking nation, to cut costs and export to Japan and Taiwan. Molybdenum is used to strengthen alloys with prices increasing by 25 percent in the past year. Korea Resources Corporation said that the smelter, located in Yeosu, 455 kilometers south of Seoul, will have initial production capacity of 6,000 metric tons a year, making it the world's seventh-largest. The plant, which will supply about half its output to Posco, may double its capacity starting next year. The smelter will help South Korea, Asia's third-largest economy, reduce dependence on refined imports from China and Chile and tap rising demand from steel mills. \"It's a smart move,\" said Mark Pervan, head of research at Daiwa Securities SMBC, in Melbourne. \"There's going to be very strong underlying demand for nickel substitute products like molybdenum and chromium,\" over the next three to four years, he said. The new smelter will initially meet 35 percent of domestic demand and save about 130 billion won ($140 million) in imports, the government-owned energy and mineral resource explorer said. The plant will meet 70 percent of domestic demand when it doubles capacity. Titanium Subsidiary for Pangan Group A leading iron and steel manufacturer in China's south western province of Panzhihua, Panzhihua Iron & Steel (Group) Co, has set up a subsidiary to deal in titanium manufacturing. Panzhihua Iron & Steel Group, which is the largest iron and steel manufacturing base in Western China, is also the largest manufacturer of titanium material and titanium dioxide Vietnam Automobile Industry Bustling With economic growth rates ranked among the highest in Southeast Asia and ever-increasing living standards, Vietnam is becoming an increasingly appealing market for foreign automobile manufacturers. A lot of Vietnamese people can afford to buy a car, and the number will increase very rapidly, even though the taxes are still high and infrastructure not very good,\" said Kijeld Michael Olsen, general manager of Motocare A/S Kjaer Group, the exclusive supplier of Nissan automobiles in Vietnam. The new car market promises to be bustling because of Vietnam's fast-growing economy, including GDP expected to rise and market demand to grow fast said Olsen. Motocare, although a newcomer to the Vietnamese market in 2004, saw a 300 per cent in sales volume from 2005 to 2006. You can say we are a small company, but we have grown a lot. We expect to double our sales here in Vietnam in 2007,\" said Olsen. Ford Vietnam Ltd general director Timothy D. Tucker said Vietnam's economy and GDP would grow even faster with a more open market. All industries were expected to grow, creating a major opportunity for Ford, he said. According to the Vietnam Automobile Manufacturing Association (VAMA), total sales recorded by its eleven members in December increased by 62 per cent from the previous month and up 27 per cent over the same month in 2005. The unexpected rise in sales volume in December helped raise total sales by domestic and joint venture automobile makers. 2007 was off to a flying start, with VAMA reporting a 152 percent rise over the first month of 2006. Consumer demand for new cars, now staying at a humble level of around 40,000 units per year, would climb to 200,000-300,000 cars per year, said one market observer. Whether this would be realised would depend heavily on Vietnamese Government policy, noted Toyota Motor Vietnam president Nobuhiko Murakami, whose company commands a 36.2 per cent share of the Vietnamese market. \"However, personally, I think Vietnam's automobile industry has great potential due to the country's quick and stable economic growth,\" Murakami said. \"If the auto industry continues developing, both foreign- invested and local car makers will be able to co-exist and grow further.\" Olsen also expressed his belief that both automobile assembly and spare parts production would continue expanding in Vietnam.", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "abcf6b3f-a197-496a-a4c7-e5067c985803", "url": "http://metalsonline.rala.com.au/?iid=5669&startpage=page0000010&xml=metalsrala_V1.xml"}

{"text": "72 Hours In San Francisco\n\n\"We've got 72 hours in San Francisco\", I said to Sam as we finalised our West Coast road trip itinerary. \"That'll be plenty of time to see everything, I'm sure\", I enthusiastically confirmed as I finalised our hotel booking.\nOh how wrong I was. I'll admit that I underestimated San Francisco - I assumed that three days would be more than enough time to tick off the big sights, eat loads of yummy food and still have some time leftover to mooch around and take in the general vibe.\n\nBut in truth, the city by the bay is much bigger than I'd anticipated, and with public transport being a little bit trickier than we've been used to in other major cities, it wasn't quite as simple as hopping from one tourist attraction to another.\n\nThat being said, we still managed to squeeze loads into our 72 hours in San Francisco, and today I thought I'd share our highlights with you. This little guide includes our \"must see\" activities, our favourite food spots, and a hotel that is perfect if you've only got a few days in the city - enjoy!\n\n72 Hours In San Francisco\n\nSTAY\n\nWe chose to stay at Hotel Zeppelin after seeing it recommended on a couple of other blogs, and I'm so glad we did. It's just a block away from Union Square which is the main transport hub in the city, and we found that a lot of the key spots we wanted to visit were within walking distance.\n\nOn top of that, Hotel Zeppelin happens to be really bloody cool! The interiors are bright and gorgeous, the bed was the biggest one we stayed in on our two week trip and there was even a cool hangout space in the basement.\n\nIf you're looking for something that merges city break chic with the edgy personality of San Francisco, this is the hotel for you.\n\nSEE/DO\n\nIf you're going to San Francisco then my number one tip is to book your tickets to Alcatraz as soon as you book your flights! The tickets sell out weeks in advance, and this is an attraction you really don't want to miss. I can't stress enough how impossible it is to get tickets on the day and I promise you'll be kicking yourself if you rock up without them.\n\nMy second top tip would be to then make sure you take the audio tour when you arrive at Alcatraz. I would never normally opt to use an audio guide in museums or galleries, but this one is brilliantly done - it's almost like listening to a crime podcast as you wander around the creepy cells. It was such an interesting and immersive experience and we both raved about it for days afterwards. This is one of the best tourist attractions I've ever been to - trust me, even if you're not that sure you want to go, just book the tickets and thank me later.\n\nCycling across the Golden Gate Bridge\n\nHigh on our list of \"must dos\" in San Francisco was cycling across the Golden Gate Bridge. It's been a bucket list item of mine for years, and it really did live up to the hype. I had the biggest grin on my face as I pedalled across the bridge with the wind in my hair and the sun on my face, and the views back across the city were totally worth navigating all the tourists for!\n\nThere are tonnes of places to hire bikes in the city, and most are pretty reasonably priced. I'd thoroughly recommend cycling across the bridge and spending the afternoon in Sausalito before catching the ferry back to the city. The weather is much warmer over there (I have no idea why!), and we had such a lovely couple of hours eating lunch in the sun and taking in the gorgeous view over the water.\n\nPIER 39/Fisherman's Wharf\n\nHow many cities can you visit around the world and tick off hanging out with sea lions while you're there? Not many I'm sure, but in San Francisco you can! Get yourself down to PIER 39 and join the hordes of other tourists watching the sea lions play fight on the floats to the west of the pier - it's very cute and also pretty entertaining.\n\nThere's plenty of other stuff to do in this area too, from playing funfair games to eating some of the best seafood in the city. Plus, you get a great view over to Alcatraz too.\n\nCable cars/Lombard Street\n\nOne of the most iconic ways to get around in San Francisco is by riding a cable car. They're a really fun way to get around, offer some great views of the city, and best of all, will help you get up those famous hills without too much effort.\n\nI'd recommend heading to Hyde St & Beach St station, which is about a 15 minute walk from PIER 39, and jumping on the Powell-Hyde line. If you ride this for a couple of stops you'll arrive at Lombard Street, which is a road famous for it's 8 tight hairpin turns. If you have time it's worth getting off the cable car for a closer look - there's also a pretty great view of the city from up here.\n\nWatch a ball game\n\nNow going to watch a baseball game is something you can do in most major US cities, but what makes it unique in San Francisco is the view. The AT&T park backs on to the water and the sun happens to set right behind the stadium, making an already fun event even more special.\n\nVisit Haight-Ashbury\n\nHaight-Ashbury is the area of San Francisco famed for being the birthplace of the hippie movement. We loved this area of the city and would totally recommend a visit - it's teeming with gorgeous coloured houses and vintage shops bursting to the seams with bargains.\n\nPainted Ladies\n\nIf you've ever seen San Francisco on TV or in a film, I can guarantee you'll have seen the Painted Ladies. They're the row of beautiful pastel coloured houses that have become synonymous with the city and somehow they're even more beautiful in real life! Head to Alamo Square and grab a spot in the park where you can sit and dream about owning one of them…\n\nEAT\n\nI'd read about Mr Holme's Bakehouse on a couple of other blogs and worried that it was somewhere that relied on Instagram hype rather than really great food. I'm happy to confirm that I was absolutely wrong - their cruffin is one of the most delicious things I've ever eaten in my whole entire life.\n\nWe had one of the best brunches of our trip at Brenda's French Soul Food. I opted for the pancakes which were perfectly fluffy, and Sam had fried chicken benedict. Yep, you read that right - fried chicken benedict. Be warned - the portions are HUGE so go hungry.\n\nIf you do hire bikes and cycle across to Sausalito, I would thoroughly recommend grabbing one of the outdoor tables at Scoma's for lunch. They specialise in seafood washed down with brilliant bottles of wine, and honestly, sitting there with Sam in the sunshine and looking out across the water was one of the highlights of our whole holiday.\n\nYou can't go all the way to San Francisco and not pay a visit to this famous bakery. Sure, it'll be full of tourists, and sure you'll have to queue half an hour to get your lunch, but it's worth it. Boudin specialise in delicious seafood chowders, soups and chillis all served up in a hollowed out sourdough bread bowl - heaven!\n\nWe found Kin Khao completely by accident - we were looking for a decent restaurant within a 10 minute walk of our hotel, and after seeing this recommended on a number of blogs, we decided to give it a go. Kin Khao is a Thai restaurant located within the Parc 55 hotel and has been recently awarded a Michelin star. The food was fresh, delicious, and best of all, great value for money! Despite all of the accolades and excellent reviews, this was the cheapest meal we had in the city.\n\n-\n\nPhew, that post ended up being longer than I first thought! I really hope some of these recommendations are useful and help you figure out how best to spend 72 hours in San Francisco. It's such a beautiful city with so much to offer.\n\nLet me know if you visit any of these places, or if you've been to them before - nothing makes me happier than chatting about travel!", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "74caf8d4-9031-40f8-8f84-a827b17bcb14", "url": "https://www.sophiecliff.com/blog/2018/08/17/72-hours-in-san-francisco"}

{"text": "Scottsdale's Troon said it has acquired an Alabama-based company that manages and develops courses in four Southern states — the latest consolidation move in a player-challenged industry.\n\nTroon, the world's largest golf-course manager, announced that it has bought Honours Golf, which develops and runs 16 courses in Alabama, Florida, Mississippi and North Carolina. Terms of the deal, which closed Tuesday, weren't disclosed.\n\nBefore the purchase, Troon managed nine courses in Florida and a few in the other three states. The company doesn't own or lease courses to which it provides services.\n\n\"This gives us a bigger footprint in an area where we wanted to be, with more mass in the Southeast,\" said Troon's founder and chief executive officer, Dana Garmany.\n\nTroon, which is privately owned, doesn't provide revenue or profit figures. But Garmany said the company manages operations that generate more than $800 million in annual revenue and employs nearly 11,000 workers worldwide, including roughly 1,800 in Arizona.\n\nMany golf courses have struggled in recent years amid overbuilding and a decline in players. For Troon, that has provided an opportunity to run more courses more efficiently, said Garmany, who founded the company in 1990. Troon will keep the Honours brand and turn the company's office in Birmingham, Ala., into a regional hub, he said.\n\nGarmany likened the consolidation trend in golf-course management to what happened in the hotel industry a couple of decades ago. Smaller golf-course managers \"have a tougher time competing,\" he said.\n\nThe acquisition comes at a time when media reports suggest the industry struggles with the challenge of fewer people playing the game and an oversupply of courses.\n\nGolf is a time-intensive and fairly costly sport. Many people in recent years have lacked the time to get out and play, said Jenna Weaver, an analyst at financial-information company Sageworks in Raleigh, N.C.\n\nPrivately owned golf courses generally have been unprofitable for several years, losing about 2 cents on every dollar of revenue in 2013, according to data collected by Sageworks. Profit margins have improved since 2008, when courses lost 9 cents per dollar of revenue, but industry sales have declined in five of the past six calendar years.\n\nIn addition to fewer people playing golf, more courses have been offering discounts or otherwise cutting prices, also hurting margins and revenue, Weaver said.\n\n\"It is improving but regardless, the industry is losing money,\" she said.\n\nTroon also specializes in homeowner association management, private-residence clubs, estate management and associated hospitality venues. The company oversees golf properties in roughly three dozen states and 29 countries.\n\nAfter the Honours acquisition, Troon now manages more than 250 golf courses. Many are highly rated courses including Troon North in Scottsdale, Ak-Chin Southern Dunes in Maricopa, the Boulders in Carefree, Kapalua in Hawaii, Pronghorn in Oregon and Princeville in Hawaii. The company's website lists more courses in Arizona than in any other state.\n\nReach the reporter at russ.wiles@arizonarepublic.com or 602-444-8616.\n\nTroon in Arizona\n\nThe courses managed by or affiliated with Troon Golf include these in Arizona.

{"text": "Month: June 2015\n\nAlthough I am posting this now, the following was written on my Southwest flight from Austin on the leg from Denver to Reno on Tuesday, June 16.\n\nMy flight has just lifted off from Denver. I am returning to Reno. To Tahoe. To the small slice of heaven I wrote about in the Powdered Donut Manifesto, Part 2. As we lift over the clouds and peek at the snow-capped Rockies in the distance, I return to Tahoe differently than when I left just over a week ago. Of course, there is the practical reality that I do not have a 100 mile bike ride ahead of me, like the last trip. This time I am simply heading up to spend a few days with Katelyn, my youngest daughter, who has been there for several days with her friend, Ella. Ella and KK are both rising 5th graders. To know their friendship is to know their unicycles, a story told in this beautiful trailer about the UniSaders at OneWheelManyChildren. I wrote more about the symbolism of the unicycle last fall in this piece, \"Our Story | Are We Riding on One Wheel? Or Instead, Are We Free?\"\n\nToday, I write Part Two of a piece that I first published on October 29, 2011. On that day, Terri Wingham of A Fresh Chapter and I both posted on the same topic, having been introduced by a #FridayFollow, a #FF, on Twitter not long before. Our respective posts can be found here and here. The past week came to a head yesterday, as a roaring sea of emotions reached shore, reached my heart, and crashed across my soul. For those that have been following The Love of My Life, you know of my abiding love for Maureen, my beautiful bride of over 24 years, my BFF, my soulmate, my rudder. My rudder. That is the word I used yesterday as I walked around my house, alone. With all three kids on their own respective trips, I had 24 hours from yesterday morning to today that I was alone, by myself. Maureen's pictures are everywhere in our home. I talk to her all the time, but it is nice to have pictures, so that I can see her with my eyes, not just my heart. As I looked into her eyes across our living room, I said, \"Maureen. I've lost my rudder. You were always that quiet stability that cut through the raging storms.\"\n\nThe wonderful thing about writing about love is that it brings back all of the beautiful memories I have from a lifetime of love with Maureen. However, as I spent the day with myself yesterday, I realized something else. Love is also a shield. It has been my armor. Yesterday, I began to comprehend what I was protecting myself from. Me. The storms. The other emotions. The pain. The feelings that are still just below the surface from the day Maureen passed from this world to the next. As I said to her mom and dad at her \"celebration of life\" just a few days after her passing, I love your daughter more than words can describe. That love drove me to strip everything from Maureen on the day of her passing that had anything to do with cancer. I simply was not going to allow last rites to be administered with anything that wasn't her. Of course, I knew her soul was already washing over all of us on 7 North that day at Seton Hospital, but as with all of my rituals, this one had meaning to me. I took off her lymphedema sleeve, undid the gauze from her right hand that kept the swelling down, delicately removed the rock tape from her physical therapists. Other than her port, I needed Maureen to be Maureen.\n\nAs I write part two of Survivorship is Not a Phase, I am coming to realize that I have not yet stripped off my gauze, my sleeve, my armor. Although these insidious cancer cells (terrorists as Terri called them in her post in 2011) were in Maureen's body, we had cancer. As I have written before, if it was biologically possible, I would have gladly taken Maureen's cancer into my own body. She was my Eve. I was blessed to be her Adam. But, like my rudder would always do, Maureen quietly looked in my eyes when I would say this, and said, \"No. I've got this.\" And, that's the thing I realized yesterday, the emotions beneath my shield of love. I am a survivor, and I have survivor's guilt. I never ask \"why Maureen?\" because to do so would be to dishonor her memory and to dishonor God. At Heavenly Donuts just over a week ago, I came to understand that eternal life changes the equation. Only the physical Maureen is gone. She is not.\n\nThere was not a day along our journey with cancer, not a day across the 11 years, that Maureen didn't choose to be a survivor, rather than a patient. For those that knew her, you knew her strength, her dignity, her courage. She was simply magnificent. For each of those 11 years, I was privileged to be not just Maureen's husband, BFF, soulmate, lover but her caregiver. However, if you knew Maureen, you knew that my caregiving was of a different kind. If you are a survivor, not a patient, then your caregiver must act differently. As I say in this video for Rallyhood, my role as caregiver was simply to love Maureen. That is why I wrote Our Story last fall as her cancer metastasized. I simply refused to write about cancer. Maureen was never cancer. She was and will always be Maureen.\n\nBut as a survivor, approaching the 8 month mark of Maureen's passing, I am looking within myself and asking the question \"who am I?\" I know that I am the son of Jean and Roy Thompson. I know I am the brother of Marcella Graham and the brother-in-law of David Graham. I know I am the proud son-in-law of Henry and Ann Diercxsens and brother-in-law of Suzanne Harrison and Dominique Gable (Diercxsens' girls). I know I am the father of Taylor, Kyla and Katelyn. I am the proud Uncle of Joshua, Cybelle, Nadine, Miles, Hannah and Ian. Each of these is an answer to prayers I prayed as a young boy about my future. If I could go back and tell that young boy that his prayers would be answered and answered magnificently, it would be so amazing, because I have been richly blessed in my life, most especially by my love affair with Maureen.\n\nAs Terri also wrote in her Survivorship is Not a Phase, \"Suicide bombers boarded planes, filled with unsuspecting passengers, and forever changed both the New York skyline and the North American psyche.\" Suicide bombers, cancer cells, have forever changed my skyline. I know I am not the only building in this skyline. I know there are many, many more spouses, partners, parents, children, siblings that have gone from \"caregiver\" to \"survivor\" because of cancer. Much is written about \"survivorship\" as it relates to cancer. Terri has the courage to write about that journey in the first person. I only write about it in the second person. What I can write about in the first person, however, is my journey as a survivor, and it is not a phase. It has taken on a new dimension. Ever since I met Terri, I thought, oh, A Fresh Chapter is for someone else, not me. However, these words from her blog suddenly take on a new dimension:\n\nThere is no universal map to follow when embarking on the road less traveled. Instead, we learn by trial and error. By trusting our intuition. By grieving our losses and doing more of what lights us up. If you want to make a change in your life and don't know how to begin or you're facing challenges you didn't expect and need a reminder to stay the course, join us for a behind the scenes conversation.\n\nI plan to take down my shield more often as I write going forward. I will trust my intuition. I will get stuff right. I will get stuff wrong. I will never stop writing about love, because love will always be my rudder. However, just like I wrote in a post about the twin towers last fall, the New York skyline has changed again. In the midst of the carnage of those suicide bombers, another building has arisen, different than those that were there before but no less beautiful. As we approach the eighth Powdered Donut Day.\n\nOn Friday, June 5, on my way up to Lake Tahoe for my 6th ride in 6 years of 100 miles with Team in Training for the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society, I noted as I wrote \"Cured,\" that it was National Donut Day. I also pointed out that part 2 of the Powdered Donut Manifesto did not quite feel ready. It simply wasn't time for the manifesto to continue. On Monday morning, after the ride on Sunday, as I walked around Heavenly Village in South Lake Tahoe, I realized why part 2 of the manifesto was not yet ready to be written. Before I share that reason, though, I need to talk a little bit about why Lake Tahoe is such spiritual and sacred ground.\n\nSix years ago, on the first Sunday in June in 2010, I came to Lake Tahoe for the second time in my life. The first time I came to Lake Tahoe was in the late 1980s, before I had met Maureen at the Apple office in Chicago. I had joined Apple in 1987, after graduating Northwestern University, and was part of an incredibly cool job called the Field Sales Associate. This FSA position was created by Bill Campbell, then VP of Sales and Marketing for John Sculley. Bill would later return to Apple and become its chairman, along with Intuit's CEO and Chairman. I was privileged to speak with Bill recently and thank him for what this position meant to my career and my life. The FSA position was unbelievably cool. It was an 18-month new graduate management training position. There were three of us in the first \"class\" in 1987, one from the west; one from the central US; and one from the east.\n\nOver the course of these 18 months, we each followed our own tracks, with a number of shared experiences. From spending a few weeks to a month in each of Apple's sales channels at the time, which included K12, Higher Ed, State & Local Government and the Dealer channel to working in a support center to even driving a fork lift to put computers on trucks, we got a chance to do a little of everything. It was amazing. Our shared experiences would occasionally bring the three of us together in Cupertino at Apple's headquarters. On one such trip, we were in California for two weeks, with a weekend in between. It was in late winter, so skiing was still a possibility, and the three of us decided to rent a place in Lake Tahoe and go skiing in Heavenly. Well, I say skiing. I'm really not so sure that what I did would be by definition, skiing. The toddlers and kids on the \"bunny hill\" at Heavenly were doing a far better job than I was at this process of gliding over snow. I think I ate more snow than I skied over! That trip to Lake Tahoe was in early 1988. 22 years later, I came back to the same spot to ride my bike for the first time with Team in Training. I sat underneath the gondolas at Heavenly from my skiing trip so many years earlier, feeling a deep sense of deja vu. Actually, timelessness might be an even better word.\n\nI was brought to Team in Training and those gondolas by a little boy named Kethan. I tell of my story with Kethan in many places, but this special video from the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society (LLS) tells his story in a way I can not, because it tells of his story and his magnificent mother and father. I had recently become Man of the Year for LLS in a fundraising campaign earlier that year, and so when I met Kethan that fall, I knew I needed to do something more. Kethan was in 1st grade at St. Andrew's with my daughter, and he was undergoing treatment for pediatric ALL, a form of blood cancer. The divine moment that happened this morning all traces back to this little boy, and my desire to climb back on my bike after many years of not riding, because I needed to do something. I wanted to take action. I wanted to do my \"one thing\" as I talked about in Part 1 of the Powdered Donut Manifesto. For six years, I have had the privilege of doing this \"one thing,\" riding my bike, first in honor of Kethan and for the last two years, in memory of this magical \"little man,\" as his mom calls him. Fortunately, I am far better at cycling, than I am skiing!\n\nThis year was also the first time I rode in memory of my beautiful bride of 24 years, my precious Maureen. I knew this weekend would be an emotional one. As I posted on Facebook just before the ride, \"we ride with angels in the wind and love in our hearts.\" As has so often been the case since Maureen's passing, I have felt the presence of my angel and the love of my life. Waiting at the airport in Austin for my flight on Friday morning, my angel spoke for the first time heading into this journey to Lake Tahoe. I was listening to Enya radio via iTunes Radio, and a song, \"Though Lovers Be Lost,\" started to play. It is by Anael, meaning Angel. I am listening to it now, as I type. The words resonate. \"Love shall always remain. I love you, and I am near you.\" Over the course of the weekend and the ride, I came to understand that though my lover be lost, she is indeed near me. On Saturday night, after dinner, after honoring one of our recently fallen riders, Tom, my team also honored Maureen with powdered donuts, and I told the story of love that the powder represents.\n\nOver the last several months of powdered donut days, the 21st of each month, I've always wondered, \"does my crazy girl in heaven know what I am up to? Does she know what that powdered donut from the weekend from before her passing has become?\" Maureen answered me this morning. She told me that she is always near me. My lover is not lost. For as I strolled again under the gondolas in the village, I not only felt that timelessness again, but I felt the distance between heaven and earth collapse. I looked up and saw this. I knew in that instant that she loved me, and she was near me. Today was clearly the day for part 2 of the manifesto.\n\nI also noticed something else about the Heavenly Donuts sign, which if you look again at the logo, you will see, too. There is a bite out of it. A bite in the top right corner. There is another logo with a bite out of it. It is this one, the Apple logo. Like the donut itself, life was coming full circle, just like our route around the lake itself the day before on our bikes. As I had said to Bill when I had the privilege of thanking him for the start to my journey, had it not been for the FSA position, I would never have met the love of my life, Maureen, at the Apple office in Chicago, and I would never have known a love that is heavenly.\n\nAlthough it is National Doughnut Day today (yes, apparently, there is day for this!), my heart and fingers feel compelled not to write Part 2 of the Powdered Donut Manifesto but instead, \"Cured.\" The seeds of this post were planted a week ago, but as with all my writing, I always wait, sometimes hours, sometimes days, sometimes longer to be sure that the seed is well watered, before it hopefully flowers in the words I write. As I fly to Lake Tahoe for my 6th Team in Training century ride for the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society (on National Doughnut Day), my heart tells me that \"Cured\" is ready to flower and be shared.\n\nBefore last Friday's events can make sense, I have to reflect quickly on the kids and my trip to San Antonio over the holidays. We headed down right after the New Year, and I wrote in detail on that trip in \"The Love of My Life | Bubbles and Powdered Donuts.\" Although it wasn't a long journey, we had a blast, and we took the water taxi up the new part of the Riverwalk into the Pearl Brewery area. It is a lovely redevelopment. We had so much fun. I always seem to have fun with these kids of Maureen and mine. I love them. They are great. We popped up the stairs from the taxi stop and put our names in at La Gloria, since they had a line, and then, we toodled around the shops. We hopped and skipped with the energy of just being together and then stopped into a place called Local. I had an espresso. The kids had hot chocolate. It was fun, and it was yummy, and we also noticed a restaurant called, \"Cured.\"\n\nBeing foodies and big Top Chef fans, we quickly noted that this was one of those, not just good restaurants but special ones, and we would have to come back. Heck, the dude that runs it worked for John Besh from New Orleans. That kind of lineage is a good sign. However, that day over the holidays was not meant for \"Cured.\" It was the day for La Gloria and some awesome Mexican food. Last Friday, though, was the day for \"Cured,\" and that day has set in motion a powerful set of connections this past week. Although I can not yet be specific, there was a very special meeting happening last Friday morning, a meeting that comes almost nine months after the beginning of the dialogue. Actually, it just dawned on me that the beginning of this dialogue is truly divine and even more connected to the story of \"Cured.\" The email that started this high-level dialogue was sent on July 11, 2014.\n\nFor those that know my story, Kethan Kumar passed on July 11, 2013. He is the very reason that I am flying to Tahoe for my 6th ride. He is the reason I am bald. He is the reason I am involved with the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society. He is the reason I wrote the email. To know Kethan, this special tribute video from the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society gives you a small glimpse into the heart of a beautiful boy and a beautiful family. As I said to someone in a text that day, it is all connected.\n\nAll of this brings me back to the sequence of events that unfolded last Friday. I decided that during this special meeting, I couldn't sit still, waiting to hear how the conversation and dialogue had unfolded. So, I decided to do my last set of hill repeats in preparation for this weekend's ride in Lake Tahoe during the 30 minutes to an hour of the meeting. It was my way to connect my energy and my heart to those in the room elsewhere. After I finished my hills in Austin, I then drove my bike down to the San Antonio office of LLS, where it was to be picked up last Sunday to be transported out to Lake Tahoe, where I will meet it this afternoon, along with my friends and the spiritual journey ahead of me this weekend. While there, I talked to Deb Barker, the Executive Director of our chapter. Having been on the Austin board for 2 terms of 3 years, Deb and I have gotten to know each other quite well. She is a truly good person and has done so much in the fight for a cure. I am truly privileged to know her and the team around her.\n\nI had mentioned to her that I was thinking of going back to the Pearl Brewery area for lunch before heading back up to Austin and told her of the kids and my trip from New Year's. Then, she told me of the story behind \"Cured.\" She told me of Chef Steve, who is apparently on our San Antonio LLS board, and I began to feel it. I began to feel the goosebumps on the inside, as I call them in this video, Living Your Passion. I knew that I had to head south from our LLS office in north San Antonio. I had to have some of these magically cured and seasoned meats of Chef Steve and his team. As I walked up the steps into this building from 1904, I felt the calm and the happiness that always overwhelms me when I am on a date with Maureen. She may not be here physically, but I have come to understand and fully embrace my new reality, my angel. Maureen is always with me, on our date, and she was with me that day, last Friday, enjoying the architectural space that makes \"Cured\" more than a restaurant. I know love is the one dimension that connects heaven and earth, but I suspect that you don't see and feel like we do here on earth, so I walked around the restaurant, so Maureen could see it through my eyes.\n\nAs I enjoyed my white asparagus soup and my pate (a favorite Maureen would always make from a family recipe), I then fully embraced the true meaning of \"Cured.\" For you see, Chef Steve didn't just name it for the aging process of his meats. He named it Cured, because he is a lymphoma survivor. And in the grace of his restaurant, I smiled and felt a tear roll down my cheeks, enjoying his magnificent food and my date with Maureen, knowing that the kids and I would be back here together, soon. In the warm and beautiful sun, I walked out, basking, feeling the warmth of love, because it all comes full circle, just like the doughnut. And I also realized that the ultimate cure is indeed love.\n\nWould I have loved for us to find a \"cure\" for Maureen's breast cancer. You bet. Would I have loved for Kethan to reach his \"cure\" with Dr. June's work at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. You bet. However, I realized that Chef Steve's cure went deeper than just the eradication of his lymphoma cells. Chef Steve's cure was love, a clear love for the art of good food, good food that he shares with all of us. Until I take my last breath and rejoin my Maureen, I will continue on the path of my love and a cure, because love is the best seasoning for life… and when the time is right, I will tell you about what happened in that meeting… 🙂", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "60255547-2b36-4e05-b307-bfe57066d2f2", "url": "http://theendoflinearity.com/2015/06/"}

You could also fear some of the judgment that your fellow classmates might pass on you if they found out who you really were. At age 10, however, girls start to get playful and interested in boys. The dreamer in the naked dream will often be going about doing a normal activity — going to school, giving a presentation, standing in line — when suddenly there is a realization of being completely naked. One day, when I was walking my usual route through my high school's field to get to the street that led to my home, as I was walking by the chainlink fence that separated the field from the backyards of the houses there, I heard some girls laughing and giggling.\n\nI took my friends to the nude beach.

If so, here it is:\n\nNow, it might be a while until Pokémon: Let's Go, Pikachu / Eevee officially launches on the Nintendo Switch (it's currently slated for November 2018) but to help ramp up the excitement I thought it would be fun to list five of the best reasons to be excited about the next Pokémon game.\n\nLet's go 😉\n\n5) You can customise your characters\n\nHave you always wanted to give your Gyrados its own mohawk? Well you now can! (Maybe.) You can certainly choose the gender of your main pokémon – be it Pikachu or Eevee – and the latest trailer reveals that you can customise their hairstyles as well. I must admit, this wasn't at the top of my wish list for new Pokémon features, but it's a fun addition and I think it's going to add a certain 'je ne sais quoi' to the game. You can also fine-tune the appearance of your trainer in terms of outfits and accessories, which is a neat touch.\n\n4) Multiplayer\n\nIt seems that you will be able to play Pokémon: Let's Go, Pikachu / Eevee with your friends! That's cool. You can work together co-operatively to explore Kanto, and you can also team up in battles, which I'm assuming includes fights with the gym leaders as well? Oh on top of that, you can trade your pokémon locally or online in moments of seamless brilliance. If you know anybody who's willing to give up their Typhlosion…\n\n3) The Pokéball Plus joycon\n\nI love this idea. It's a device that's shaped like an ordinary pokéball, but it also serves as a joycon, so you can use it to navigate your way through the entire game. It also lights up, vibrates and makes noises, helping to sell the illusion that a real pocket monster is moving around inside.\n\n2) Exclusive pokémon\n\nIt wouldn't be Pokémon without multiple versions of the same game which are identical in almost every respect apart from the types of creatures you can discover! Pokémon: Let's Go, Pikachu / Eevee is no exception, and the two versions will feature pokémon which are exclusive to their respective versions. For Pikachu, these are Oddish, Sandshrew and Growlithe, whilst for Eevee the exclusives are Bellsprout, Vulpix and Meowth. I'm sure these aren't exhaustive lists but it is great to see that multiplayer trading will not only be encouraged but necessary if one is to truly \"catch 'em all.\"\n\n1) It's a remake of Pokémon Yellow\n\nOkay, not entirely, but almost. This game is certainly about as close to fully-fledged remake as we're going to get (for the time being) and with characters such as Professor Oak, along with gym leaders Misty and Brock, the nostalgiaometer will be at terminal velocity.\n\nThat being said, some things are best left forgotten. I seem to remember hours of endless wandering in the Cerulean Caves which have left me with a permanent psychological scar, so I can't say I'm itching to relive this traumatic experience. But hey, it'd be on the Nintendo Switch, so at least it would be colourful.\n\nAnyway, there we are – five reasons to be excited about the next Pokémon game! Now all I need to do is buy a Nintendo Switch. Which aspect of the game are you most excited for? And will your Pikachu have a pony-tail? Let me know in the comments below.", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "e315cdc7-13e5-4b8b-ae1f-46dd02566c03", "url": "https://alsurvive.com/2018/07/17/pokemon-lets-go-5-reasons-to-be-excited-about-the-next-pokemon-game/"}
{"text": "A performer on St. Kilda's never-dull beach twirls fire in a near endless knot as midnight approaches. This is a single exposure which I shot handheld, but seeing as both he and the fire were moving and the background is underexposed out of the shot, it all worked out. Although you can't see too much of him, I really like how his face appears to be really intent on the fire he's twirling, like he's concentrating really hard. Well, you can't blame him, can you?\n\nA few more images capturing a snapshot of some of the journeys I've been privileged enough to take over the last couple of years…\n\nNiger (2005)\n\nGilded sand lies in soft swathes across the southern Sahara Desert, in the north of this landlocked and critically-impoverished nation. Stuck in Niger over Christmas during a field posting, I joined friends for a 5-day trip through the wild north of the country, and it proved to be one of the most dramatic and satisfying travel experiences of my life to date. An absolute highlight by any standard was the time we spent among the dunes of Tizirzak, where wind-blown features among fair sand-dunes were the foreground to the dramatic backdrop of the barren and jagged Aïr Mountains. One of the most inhospitible landscapes on the planet, it was memorable for its stark, fierce beauty and isolation. We barely saw another group of travellers in five days of driving. To this day, I have seen few scenes that compare with the drama and allure of the dunes of the Sahara.\n\nQueensland (2007)\n\nI spent a long weekend at a resort not far from the Sunshine Coast mecca of Noosa. I'm not much of a beach-vacation type most of the time, and this was no exception- I found myself generally bored and listless. I did however manage to find a bit of time to photograph the sun going down over the Noosa Lakes, close to where I was staying. The light was fantastic throughout. After falling in the estuary, I took this shot of the light after the sun had vanished. The water has taken on the texture of burnished gold. I shot with a neutral density filter, which is in effect a piece of darkened but colourless glass, and which in essence allows the shutter to be left open for longer without overexposing the frame. Here, I left the shutter open for a good half minute or so, with the result that the blemishes in the water have smoothed themselves out, and the golden clouds have blurred themselves in the passage through the sky. When it works, using ND filters are one of my favourite photographic techniques.\n\nNew Zealand (2007)\n\nI'm a Kiwi. Sometimes I feel a bit of a fraud identifying myself with Aotearoa. I've lived there for less than six years, or somewhat under one fifth of my total existence. Growing up a Global Nomad, or Third Culture Kid (TCK), I've been a little bit free to pick and choose where I want to belong. Really, I've chosen not to belong anywhere, and my defacto home becomes wherever I open my backpack. However, the one nation I do identify with consistently, and with considerable pride, is New Zealand. (I'd like to point out that I do in fact hold a Kiwi passport, and spent the early years of my childhood there, so my claim to NZ citizenship isn't entirely fabricated). I too this shot of a rocky outcrop in the Hauraki Gulf north of Auckland during an all-too-brief trip home with some friends. We spent a week or so driving around the northern half of the North Island, and enjoyed pretty good weather for the most part, as well. New Zealand is another country where I really just want to spend a good block of time with a car, a good pair of walking shoes, and my camera. One of these days…\n\nArizona (2005)\n\nA dear childhood friend of mine lives in Arizona with his wife, where they happily enjoy a far more geographically-stable existence than I do with their burgeoning clan of three children. I went and visited them for a few days over the Independence Day weekend in 2005, where they were staying with relatives near Sedona. Although we're in irregular contact, our paths haven't directly crossed since- although I know that they will before too long. It's tough being apart from people you care about, but equally it's nice having friends scattered globally with whom you can touch base when you travel. Such is the way of the nomad.\n\nI took this shot at dusk as I arrived in Sedona. The outcrop is known as the Courthouse, and it stands like a monolith over this picturesque south-western town. Visually, Sedona is far and away one of the most beautiful settlements I've visited. Nestled among striking ochre sedimentary rock formations, it seems to burn with fire as the sun goes down, while during the day it sits beneath a flawless blue sky. I took this shot during my early days of investigating digital photography. The image itself is of no real technical merit, but the subject never ceases to bore me to look at. Creation at its finest.\n\nVictoria (2007)\n\nPeriodically my home, Melbourne remains in my opinion one of the most understated travel destinations in Australia- and by inference, the world. Although I've lived here perhaps four of the last six years, I rate it as easily the most livable place I've spent time, echoing the international surveys that generally score Melbourne in top spot alongside Canada's Vancouver, also a desirable place to spend time. Sydney tends to get the attention as a tourist destination, with its Harbour Bridge, Opera House, and a handful of azure-watered beaches. Move away from the waterfront, however, and in my opinion Sydney looses its charm.\n\nMelbourne, by contrast, has a little of everything to suite everybody. A range of great millieu's throughout the city provide great cafés, restaurants and even shopping [shudder]. It has a vibrant and built-up Central Business District with all manner of services and conveniences, not to mention a hip and varied nightlife. Among my favourite features of Melbourne are the quirky little pubs and clubs dotted around its backalleys, so that I rarely seem to end up at the same place twice when I go out. Within minutes of the city are long stretches of sand that wrap right around the eastern arm of Port Phillip Bay, while to the West lead to the world-renowned surfing spots near Torquay. Sweeping views of the Bass Straights offer themselves from the Great Ocean Road, while to the north of Melbourne, the gentle country of the Yarra Valley's wine region open up into great expanses of open plains to the north and west, while the Great Dividing Range provides dramatic country for hiking, climbing, horseback riding, and at a pinch, skiing (although as a sworn affecionado of the Canadian Rockies, I have to say Mt. Buller is a bit of a let-down).\n\nThis shot is of one of the more quirky Melbourne attractions, and one for which I have little time myself, except for the grotesque vibrance of the colours. Luna Park is a time-honored fairground metres from the waterfront at St. Kilda. This shot is about as close as I ever plan to get to it, but I did like the angle and the ferocious contrast of lines and tones.\n\nMali (2006)\n\nTomboctou (Timbuktu) is synonymous with the concept of the nomad. For travellers, it represents a destination as far-flung as it's possible to go, the proverbial ends of the earth. In fact, so proverbial is its connotation that when I mention it in conversation, more than once people have asked me, \"is Timbuktu real then?\"\n\nNot only real, but once a vibrant hub in the life of the original nomads of the Sahara. Tuareg caravans gave the city its wealth towards the beginning of the second millenium, when salt dug from pits in the desert was brought here on vast camel trains featuring hundreds of the beasts, and where slabs of salt the size of table-tops would be traded weight-for-weight with gold. It became a centre for Islamic scholarship, with one of the great ancient libraries once stored here (the city is now home to an audacious project to identify and restore ancient Islamic manuscripts being funded by Libya's Moammar Ghadaffi), and is considered to be the third holiest city in Islaam, after Mecca and Medina. Its fame spread throughout the African continent, until the Moors heard of its fame in the fourteenth century and sent an army south from Marrakech. The invaders seized the northern half of Mali, and it has bourne the scars of the conquest ever since. The door pictured above is of a style unique to the area, but bears the visual influence of the Moroccan architecture which can be seen throughout Tomboctou on its mosques and classical buildings.\n\nTomboctou is a hot dusty town in the middle of nowhere. Perched on the southern edge of the Sahara, abandoned by an arm of the Niger River that has since filled in and left it stranded far from a water course, it is one of Francophone West Africa's best-known tourist destinations, but it is still well off the beaten track in every sense imaginable. I visited in the peak of the hot season, and I can safely say that even after a year of living in Niger, I have never been consistently hotter, nor consistently more dehydrated, than during my time there. However it is a mystical and exciting place, with narrow side-streets filled with blowing sand, and exotic, otherworldly architecture that stimulates the imagination. A traveller in Africa should ensure that northern Mali is high up on their list of must-see places", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "80e28fdf-5e93-4ed7-af67-d1b91948252a", "url": "https://morealtitude.wordpress.com/tag/st-kilda/"}

Cast Pages: pages Publisher.\n\nRevolt in the abstract is—revolting. Yes, the most poetical thing, more poetical than the flowers, more poetical than the stars—the most poetical thing in the world is not being sick. With surprise, but with a curious pleasure, he found Rosamond Gregory still in his company. Do you mean what you say now?\n\nNow, sometimes a man like your brother really finds a thing he does mean. It may be only a half-truth, quarter-truth, tenth-truth; but then he says more than he means—from sheer force of meaning it. Syme strolled with her to a seat in the corner of the garden, and continued to pour out his opinions. For he was a sincere man, and in spite of his superficial airs and graces, at root a humble one.\n\nAnd it is always the humble man who talks too much; the proud man watches himself too closely. He defended respectability with violence and exaggeration.\n\nHe grew passionate in his praise of tidiness and propriety. All the time there was a smell of lilac all round him. Once he heard very faintly in some distant street a barrel-organ begin to play, and it seemed to him that his heroic words were moving to a tiny tune from under or beyond the world. To his astonishment, he discovered the whole garden empty. Everyone had gone long ago, and he went himself with a rather hurried apology.\n\nHe left with a sense of champagne in his head, which he could not afterwards explain.\n\nIn the wild events which were to follow this girl had no part at all; he never saw her again until all his tale was over. And yet, in some indescribable way, she kept recurring like a motive in music through all his mad adventures afterwards, and the glory of her strange hair ran like a red thread through those dark and ill-drawn tapestries of the night.\n\nFor what followed was so improbable, that it might well have been a dream. When Syme went out into the starlit street, he found it for the moment empty.\n\nHouse of night series (PDF, epub)\n\nThen he realised in some odd way that the silence was rather a living silence than a dead one. Directly outside the door stood a street lamp, whose gleam gilded the leaves of the tree that bent out over the fence behind him. About a foot from the lamp-post stood a figure almost as rigid and motionless as the lamp-post itself. The tall hat and long frock coat were black; the face, in an abrupt shadow, was almost as dark.\n\nOnly a fringe of fiery hair against the light, and also something aggressive in the attitude, proclaimed that it was the poet Gregory. He had something of the look of a masked bravo waiting sword in hand for his foe.\n\nHe made a sort of doubtful salute, which Syme somewhat more formally returned. About what? Gregory struck out with his stick at the lamp-post, and then at the tree. There is your precious order, that lean, iron lamp, ugly and barren; and there is anarchy, rich, living, reproducing itself—there is anarchy, splendid in green and gold.\n\nI wonder when you would ever see the lamp by the light of the tree. Gregory began in a smooth voice and with a rather bewildering smile.\n\nRevealed: A House of Night Novel\n\nYou did something to me that no man born of woman has ever succeeded in doing before. The captain of a penny steamer if I remember correctly at Southend. You have irritated me.\n\nIf I struck you dead I could not wipe it out. There is only one way by which that insult can be erased, and that way I choose. I am going, at the possible sacrifice of my life and honour, to prove to you that you were wrong in what you said.\n\nYou do not think that in a deeper, a more deadly sense, I am serious. Are these damned Chinese lanterns serious? Is the whole caboodle serious? Is it really true that you have one?\n\nWill you swear that! You say that a poet is always an anarchist. I disagree; but I hope at least that he is always a sportsman.\n\nPermit me, here and now, to swear as a Christian, and promise as a good comrade and a fellow-artist, that I will not report anything of this, whatever it is, to the police. And now, in the name of Colney Hatch, what is it? The two got into it in silence. Gregory gave through the trap the address of an obscure public-house on the Chiswick bank of the river\n\nIDPF Members\n\nShow related SlideShares at end. WordPress Shortcode.

{"text": "vrijdag 29 november 2013\n\nPool Light - Owen EdwardsThe Human form has no better friend, December 28, 1998 By pemerson@knight-hub.com (Washington, DC) - See all my reviews\n\nAs a photographer, choreographer and dancer myself, I tend to be a tough sell on books which hype a photographer's mastery of the human form, particularly where dance or dancers are concerned. But such is my appreciation, and awe, of what Schatz has accomplished in his water studies that I stopped dead in my tracks when I saw that he had published \"Pool Light.\"\nLess a book about dancers than about the incredible beauty of the human body, \"Pool Light,\" transcends the very things which frustrate us as movers. In this book, the photographer and his models make us believe in both flight and fantasy. They inspire us to see shape unihibited by gravity or earthly confines. And they succeed in taking nudity, within a photographic environment, out of the controversial realms of \"indecency\" and restoring it to art in the way the great painters have seen it.\n\nTechnically, the work is nothing short of a marvel. Great photography, like any great art, deceives the viewer into believing that what they see is so easy, so natural, as to be routinely simple. In \"Pool Light,\" we see none of the sweat, none of the frustration and aches (and presumably water-logged participants), which must certainly have gone into each image. Instead, we are invited simply to see that most classic of forms, and ancient of muses, the human figure, shown, through the most contemporary of techniques, in a way which celebrates both even as it transcends our sense of their limitations.", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "cdc71bfb-6c6d-4846-890b-ed5862d52cd7", "url": "http://angeleq.blogspot.com/2013/11/pool-light-owen-edwards-boek-everyones.html"}

{"text": "Category: Bake\n\nWith St Patrick's Day being tomorrow, one's thoughts turn to food. Specifically food of an Irish sort, which includes, naturally enough, all things potato. So when I was reading through my recently acquired copy of Margaret Bates' Talking about Cakes with an Irish and Scottish Accent, her recipe for Potato Apple Cake caught my eye. She said it was a delicacy from the orchard districts of Co Armagh but didn't give an exact recipe, describing it as two rounds of potato cake sandwiching an apple filling and cooked on the griddle.\n\nIt's not that I need an excuse to bake, especially if there's a cake and/or chocolate involved, but the radio was so full of International Women's Day blather today – George Hook was particularly enjoying himself with his list of \"top ten females\" on Newstalk! – that I just had to make something to distract myself.\n\nSometimes, in this house, baking is not just for the bigger members of the family and, along with the Flapjacks and Shortbread, there's even a tin marked with Little Missy's name. It's currently filled with these twice-baked Banana Spelt Biscotti, which I love because they are easily made, contain no sugar and it's up to you about the kind of flour you use. These, along with LM's favourite rice cakes, are perfect afternoon snacks – and easily portable – but she is quite happy to munch on them at any stage, and especially loves a small smear of marmite on the biscotti when we're at home.\n\nSweet treats for the one you love: Chocolate Caramel ShortbreadNever mind flowers and forget about going out for dinner, with Valentine's Day tomorrow, get baking for your sweetheart with this Chocolate Caramel Shortbread. This recipe makes plenty to devour and share but it's so good that your biggest problem will be not eating the entire thing today.\n\nChristmas is the time for long, leisurely brunches with family and friends. Make it easy with dishes that you can prepare in advance and whip into the oven just before your guests arrive. Caroline Hennessy, writing for EveryMonday.ie, gives you a few easy ideas that won't have you losing your Christmas cheer.

As a child he played baseball and knows the importance of having a positive experience on the field and this is why McGraw has chosen to direct funds from Swampstock to Rayville's Dixie League. Over the years Swampstock has grown considerably but one thing that has not changed is his base goal -- which is to help develop a quality Little League program for the children of the Rayville community and to provide a college scholarship fund for area students.\n\nSwampstock 2001 is sponsored in part by Coca-Cola.\n\nRED CROSS BENEFIT\n\nLos Angeles musicians, actors, writers and dancers are holding an unplugged benefit concert/variety show titled Acoustic Americans Benefit for The Red Cross.

Read More »\n\nFrom the critics\n\nCommunity Activity\n\nComment\n\nI am not usually a huge fan of fantasy but the world-building and characters in this series are phenomenal. The plot does lag a little in terms of action but this book makes up for it with great characters and a fast-paced sequel. I highly recommend this series for fantasy fans or for those who want to go outside their genre comfort zone.\n\nAbsolutely adored this book. LGBTQIA+ representation was amazing, the love between the two women characters shone a light through the darker themes and intense story line.\n\nThe world building was unique and reminiscent of the author's Asian heritage. The characters were empathetic, determined and dynamic. The plot was suspenseful and engrossing. I'm eager to know if there's a sequel and to read whatever else Ngan has to offer :)\n\nI thought the book was truly amazing. It kinda explained what could happen in the real world. As well most books with secret romance are boy and girl. I love that the it was a girl and girl. I hope other people like it as much as me.\n\nI did not love this book. The dialogue was truly terrible and all of the characters were one-dimensional. Readers feel sympathy for the main protagonist but can't connect with her on a deeper level. Overall the plot was interesting, I just don't think it was executed well.\n\nFirst of all, I'm gonna call bs on that epilogue.\nOverall the story was interesting. I just didn't connect well with it. I'm sure that was at least in part because of the woman who read it. Perhaps in the future I'll reread it without listening, and my impression will change.\n\nFor a young adult novel I thought this book was fantastic! The mixture of first and third person style was really interesting and the captivating, and at times temptuous, writing really appealed to me. The love story progressed at just the right pace and kept you wanting to read more, rooting for the couple to find a way to be together. Even though there was a fantasy aspect of this with demons etc. it wasn't done in a over the top fashion and was still believable. I enjoyed it quite a bit.\n\nThis book is incredible. The world-building, the lore, the setting and the characters were all fully realized and described beautifully. The heroine, Lei, is likable but she's also very flawed. There were times I felt annoyed by her and that's alright. Perfect characters are boring. Lei can be self-centered at times and sometimes doesn't see beyond her own little section of the world, but throughout the book she grows.\n\nMy favorite character, however, is the love interest Wren. Now, this is a romance between two women, so if that bothers you, this book may not be for you. The scenes between them are sensual and intimate, but not overly graphic. I loved their love story and the way it developed. Wren is a total bad-ass and the perfect counter. I really think Wren was the girl of fire, not so much Lei.\n\nIt leaves things open for a series and I really hope the author follows through with that. We need more novels with LGBTQ+ romance and main characters of color, of which this book has both.\n\nWarning: This book does contain scenes of rape and sexual assault. The scenes are not graphic, but the aftermath can be hard to read.\n\nThe thing about paper is that it is often underestimated. Easily torn, shredded, and disposed; yet, in rock paper scissors it overcomes rock. And it creates from itself the fuel of fire. In a world where demons rule over humankind (paper caste), one girl sees much reason to rebel against her system. When she is chosen to serve the demon king, she is set up against her internal and external fears. When she falls in love, it makes that bit of difference that spurs her on. I enjoyed the cultural ties (Mandarin) throughout this book. @Siri of the Teen Review Board at the Hamilton Public Library\n\nSummary\n\n\"The citizens of Ikhara comprise three castes: the oppressed, fully human \"Paper\" class; \"Steel,\" a human-animal mash-up; and the reigning \"Moon\" caste, made up of anthropomorphic animals called demons. Every year, the Moon caste's king claims eight \"Paper Girls\" as concubines. It's an alleged honor, but when the military collects golden-eyed, 17-year-old Lei from her family's herbal medicine shop, she's devastated. Her father will suffer if she resists, however, and she wonders about finding her mother, also taken, so Lei relocates to the ruler's Hidden Palace. Although she dreads being summoned to the brutal king's bedroom, Lei finds comfort in the friendship of her fellow courtesans—particularly the secretive Wren, with whom she falls in love. Ngan's plot is tense and tight, her action sequences are elegant and adrenaline-soaked, and her story's stakes increase exponentially through the pulse-pounding conclusion. She champions self-empowerment while condemning classism, homophobia, and the commodification of women.\" - From Publishers Weekly", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "dfca4477-8ef3-424a-a95c-718d3773f727", "url": "https://portlandlibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/1700035077"}

{"text": "Iron Butt Rally 2017\n\nT-1\n\nIt's early Sunday afternoon and we're waiting for the Riders' Meeting at 14.30. This year we don't have to attend the Rookies' meeting as we are already Iron Butt Rally finishers.\n\nThe last couple of days have been rather relaxed. Friday was spent mostly catching up with old friends and sleeping. We had to fit a new switch to our auxiliary lights as the old one had got water inside and was unreliable. Luckily Clearwater were able to send the part to the hotel.\n\nEasy job, just fiddly taking off the side panel. At least it wasn't raining!\n\nJet lag and a desire to 'bank' some sleep (although it's not proven to be any benefit) meant we could sleep without any excuses. Early night? It's 19:30 is that too late?\n\nSaturday is the day when all the paperwork and tech inspections take place. Old timer Gerhard (I think it's his 9th IBR) said at dinner that it's not worth queuing up when the doors open, better to have a relaxed breakfast first, so that's what we did.\n\nRobert was at the table looking very glum. He'd lost his only copy of the required medevac insurance. He wasn't going to be able to get a replacement until Monday morning which was too late to start. We suggested he could buy insurance like ours on-line and get a copy emailed to him. His face lit up! We saw him later, he'd got it all sorted and was good to go.\n\nThere were, as predicted, huge queues at the video, camera and pack slots, so we wandered out into the car park to see what it was like there. Only a few people waiting for the bike tech inspection. When it was our turn we answered all the questions and showed all the paperwork. \"Is that a standard exhaust?\" – No. Oh dear. And \"That tank isn't standard is it?\" Better call Warchild over to examine. \"Did you write to me about the tank?\" No….Raised eyebrows (his usual look!) – OK, start her up. Brrrmmmm. Now rev it VRRRM VRRRM. Warchild did a 'cut' gesture. Then just nodded. It was OK.\n\nA small part of the car park\n\nOne of our fellow rally riders had an auxiliary tank that was leaking all over his exhaust. If he couldn't get it fixed his rally was over before it started. Some of the local competitors helped him sort it out. There is a real spirit of camaraderie.\n\nNext was the odo check. This is where a standard local route is ridden to check how accurate the odometers are. We were given instructions. One of them was 'Plymouth Metro Link parking is kitty corner from your location'. Kitty Corner?? Apparently that means 'at the opposite corner'. Nevertheless, we managed to miss it and had to do the check again. We weren't alone, the daily report said about 25 other people had to repeat it.\n\nRobert looking happier now he's all set to go (thanks for the cover Dave)\n\nHaving completed the outdoor items we wandered in and were pleased to see no queues and breezed through the video (answering all the 'you do understand motorcycling is dangerous' type questions on video), camera check – ensuring that the camera will produce photos with the correct details, and collection of our rally t-shirts. The theme seems to be related to the natural world so we're looking forward to that.\n\nWe had a good meal with Tom Loftus, Mark Crane, Robert Bolger and Jerry White. Jerry is not participating this year and is interviewing IBR riders then putting the results on YouTube which is an interesting idea.\n\nAnother early night and lots of sleep followed by a leisurely breakfast. We bumped into Jerry again and he asked me to be interviewed. Kevin doesn't like being in front of a camera but was coerced into 'appearing' in sound only. We've embedded a copy of the video Jerry did with me below (thanks for allowing us to do so Jerry) and you can see more of Jerry's videos on his YouTube channel.\n\nWe're as ready as we're going to be and this is the last update here until our rally is finished.\n\nWe have combined a post made the day before leg one of the Iron Butt rally (page one) with our IBR write-up as it makes sense contextually. Comments above this were made on that post. Comments below were made after the full write-up was posted.\n\nGlad to see you two made it through again. Excellent write up as usual. Mary and enjoyed it immensely. A week before you were riding the Northern side of Lake Superior, we were driving the opposite shore. It is an amazing lake. More like a sea then any lake I've seen.\n\nThanks for the detailed and interesting writeup. It's interesting to get the perspective of someone from the UK on our beautiful country, including some good and bad points.\n\nBy some coincidence, on Friday I found myself at one of the rally bonus locations. I was later informed by the fellow who added it to the rally book that it was part of the 2017 IBR, only after I had my picture taken there.\n\nGlad you still felt it was fun after all the ups and downs. You're a fine example to other couples, both in your love for each other and your support and good spirits to the end. Congrats again an a fine finish. This was a tough rally with fierce competition. Cheers to you both.", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "203dc2af-1c58-486e-b223-bfc23f687588", "url": "https://thewellers.net/motorcycling/iron-butt-rally-ibr-2017"}

Coached by Fred Biletnikoff Jr., son of the former Raiders wide receiver, the Cougars scored 58 of their 74 points against Sunrise Mountain but struggled mightily to score in a 9-8 win over Moapa Valley and a 27-7 loss to Foothill.\n\nSenior quarterback Keegan Tharp has completed 24 of 52 passes for 411 yards with 4 touchdowns and 2 interceptions, with 250 of those yards on 10 passes to senior Andrew Montez. Chris Avila, one of the few sophomores on Coronado's varsity roster, has been by far the top rusher. The 5-foot-5, 145-pounder, who did little against Foothill and Moapa Valley, gained 110 yards on just 5 carries against Sunrise Mountain, numbers unlikely to be matched against the Trojans' defense.\n\n■Did you know?: In the only other game between Coronado and Pahrump Valley, the Trojans won 16-15 in 2001 but later forfeited the game for using an ineligible player.\n\n■Coach Clayton says: \"Coronado has the numbers.

{"text": "Nyonya Kuih around Penang\n\nPenang is a great city known for its plethora of hawker food and Nyonya kuih is one main culinary draw which interest me. The kuih which is the perfect tea-time and after-meal treat has since found its way into the menus of restaurants and cafes.\n\nNyonya kuih come in various shapes, colours, flavours and textures. One would normally expect to find steamed items but there are deep-fried and baked versions too. Some may be new to you and some you may have already heard of: Kuih Talam, Kuih Lapis, Pulut Tai Tai, Kuih Dadar, Kuih Koci, Onde-Onde, Kuih Kosui, Abok Abok, Sago Gula Melaka, Poh Piah Chee and Curry Puff.\n\nIt is worth going to the Nyonya kuih stall in Cecil Street Market. The stall has rows of trays filled to the brim with variety of kuihs for the afternoon market crowd. Customers crowd the stall to pick up their favorite sweet and savory kuihs. Some choose to take home the kuih while others head for a table and enjoy the kuih with hot cup of local coffee or icy drink from the neigbouring stall.\n\nFor those craving for something spicy, go for the deep-fried Curry Chicken Puff, with savory filling of slightly spicy potato and chicken. Kuih Dadar is a concoction that is bound to have you hankering for more. The rolled-up pandan crepe stuffed with grated coconut cooked in palm sugar gravy is sinfully rich and satisfying. The same sweetened grated coconut filling in palm sugar gravy is also found in Kuih Koci, a triangular shaped kuih wrapped in banana leaves.\n\nLocated in Jalan Mesjid, Off Chulia Street, it is one of Penang's oldest (80 years) and most established Nyonya kuih makers. At the outlet, visitors can observe the making of the kuihs. Besides catering for directly walk-in crowd, the outlet also offers personalized orders for function.\n\nThe owner, Mr Mook Hian Beng who runs the outlet with his family has since added on a little cosy corner 'canteen', offering sit down environment for patrons to enjoy the food. The quaint place is well-received by locals and expatriates alike, and the crowds are especially big on weekends and public holidays. Some home cooked specialities such as Assam Laksa, Nasi Lemak, Nasi Ulam, Kuih Pie Tee, Jiu Hoo Char and Nasi Kunyit are added to the kuih menu.\n\nPulut Tai Tai is an appealing kuih with white glutinous rice steamed with coconut milk and partly colored blue with the juice from the bunga telang. The slightly chewy kuih is delicious with a thick spread of kaya (coconut jam cooked with pandan leaves).\n\nAs for the Kuih Talam, it is like a party in the mouth, with sweet and slightly salty flavors complimenting each other beautifully. The layers of green and white is made from simple recipe of few ingredients – green pea flour, fresh pandan juice, rice flour, fresh santan (coconut milk), salt and sugar. The combination of the sweet green layer and the slightly salty white coconut layer will please just about anyone.\n\nKuih Talam\n\n* This is a reproduction of my article published in Foodsion Magazine Issue No.52", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "fc8a6c5a-6f14-440d-bf00-16bc84fc333a", "url": "https://www.what2seeonline.com/2016/12/nyonya-kuih-around-penang/"}

{"text": "Claim £40 Bonus Bet\n\nFriday's race of the day – Will the favourite be denied in Ascot's Supreme Trial?\n\nJon Vine takes a look at each of the four runners in the Grade Two Kennel Gate Hurdle at Ascot and provides readers with his tips in Friday's race of the day on Friday 20th December.\n\nTesting ground has led to disappointing turn outs in both of the Grade Twos at Ascot on Friday. With only two runners to look at in the Noel Novices' Chase, it's the Supreme Trial – listed as the Kennel Gate Novices' Hurdle – that I've selected as today's race of the day and, as part of our Daily Tips service, I've taken a look through the field to find my best bet.\n\nMaster Debonair\n\nBeat Thyme Hill in a Listed bumper at Cheltenham last autumn. Was beaten on his return to the track as he made his hurdles debut in October, losing out to Heaven Help Us, who has hardly boosted that form since. Ground out a seven-length triumph here at Ascot last month, beating some useful sorts quite convincingly. Has to carry a three-pound penalty in this Grade Two, but could still be a factor.\n\nMcFabulous\n\nEnded last season with two excellent wins in bumpers. First over Faustinovick at Newbury, before scoring in the Grade Two bumper at Aintree's Grand National Festival. Carried an odds-on price into his hurdles bow, but was beaten four lengths on the day. Was clearly in need of the run, as many of Paul Nicholls' are on their first starts, but the form of that race isn't good and I'm not convinced heavy ground will suit.\n\nMaster Debonair (left) finishes second on first start over hurdles at Cheltenham.\n\nRibble Valley\n\nThree-from-three since finishing sixth behind Master Debonair in a bumper last November. Won a flat race at Ayr on final start of last season and bolted up in two novice hurdles in November. Won by nine-lengths on heavy ground on his reappearance, before cruising to an eleven length triumph over some decent hurdlers on most recent run at Wetherby. Going right-handed is an unknown, but ground conditions are firmly in his favour and his jumping has been faultless so far.\n\nTime Flies By\n\nHas only run in two bumpers so far, winning nicely at Cheltenham before a shock-loss to Isreal Champ, who'll carry the tag of favouritism into the card-closing Listed flat race on Friday. Nicky Henderson has been impressed enough with his schooling to throw him into a Grade Two on his hurdles debut. Won on heavy at Cheltenham and stable's novice hurdlers are going well.\n\nOut of the four runners here, I think McFabulous is the best long-term contender in for the Supreme. Sadly, he hasn't been seen since losing in a poor novice hurdle at Chepstow in October and I can't see this speedy sort enjoying the ground.\n\nRibble Valley will probably have the beating of Master Debonair, who will have to give the field three pounds. Everything seems to be pointing towards a Ribble Valley victory and, with the favourite sitting on 4/5, this looks a no-bet sort of race for me.\n\nIf I was to place a speculative tenner on any of the four runners, it would probably be TIME FLIES BY (7/1 Unibet). Nicky Henderson's horses have been flying this month and his young hurdlers have been in particularly good nick. Time Flies By has winning form on heavy ground and he's a half-brother to several good-quality jumpers. I wouldn't be surprised to see back-marker of the four challenge for the win", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "b13e3899-9d5d-4112-ae3e-c5daf1192177", "url": "https://www.racingtips.com/news/fridays-race-of-the-day-at-ascot-2/"}

Our TriKE and TetraKE platforms generate proprietary moieties designed to harness and enhance the cancer killing abilities of a patient's own natural killer, or NK, cells. Once bound to a NK cell, our moieties are designed to enhance the NK cell and precisely direct it to one or more specifically-targeted proteins (tumor antigens) expressed on a specific type of cancer, ultimately resulting in the cancer cell's death. TriKEs and TetraKEs are made up of recombinant fusion proteins, can be designed to target certain tumor antigens on hematologic malignancies, sarcomas or solid tumors and do not require patient-specific customization. They are designed to be dosed in a common outpatient setting similar to modern antibody therapeutics and are expected to have reasonably low cost of goods. Our ADC platform can generate product candidates that are bi-specific, ligand-directed single-chain fusion proteins that, we believe, represent the next generation of ADCs.\n\nThis press release contains certain forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict, including statements regarding our clinical focus and our current and proposed trials.

{"text": "Research Interests\n\nWe are interested in the interaction of prothrombin with prothrombinase leading to generation of thrombin and blood clotting, and the interaction of the thrombin-thrombomodulin complex with protein C initiating the negative feed-back loop that shuts down the coagulation response. Our experimental approach merges classical enzymology and X-ray structural biology with innovative techniques like smFRET, 19F NMR and cryo-EMSIBPA on the crest of the Adriatic Sea wave: Introduction to the SIBPA XXIV (2018 congress) special issue\n\nGiacomazza D, Viappiani C, Di Cera E and Musio C\n\nThe Italian Society for Pure and Applied Biophysics (SIBPA) held its XXIV National Congress in the beautiful seaside town of Ancona, Italy, on September 10-13, 2018. This special issue features a selection of contributions from the Congress in all areas of modern biophysics including molecular, cellular, applied, computational and nanoscale biophysics. SIBPA pursues its institutional tasks and carries on its successful promotion of biophysical disciplines at the national and international levels, also trough the consolidation of its partnership with Biophysical Chemistry and Elsevier.\n\nActivity in trypsin-like proteases is the result of proteolytic cleavage at R15 followed by an ionic interaction that ensues between the new N terminus of I16 and the side chain of the highly conserved D194. This mechanism of activation, first proposed by Huber and Bode, organizes the oxyanion hole and primary specificity pocket for substrate binding and catalysis. Using the clotting protease thrombin as a relevant model, we unravel contributions of the I16-D194 ionic interaction to Na binding, stability of the transition state and the allosteric E*-E equilibrium of the trypsin fold. The I16T mutation abolishes the I16-D194 interaction and compromises the architecture of the oxyanion hole. The D194A mutation also abrogates the I16-D194 interaction but, surprisingly, has no effect on the architecture of the oxyanion hole that remains intact through a new H-bond established between G43 and G193. In both mutants, loss of the I16-D194 ionic interaction compromises Na binding, reduces stability of the transition state, collapses the 215-217 segment into the primary specific pocket and abrogates the allosteric E*-E equilibrium in favor of a rigid conformation that binds ligand at the active site according to a simple lock-and-key mechanism. These findings refine the structural role of the I16-D194 ionic interaction in the Huber-Bode mechanism of activation and reveal a functional linkage with the allosteric properties of the trypsin fold like Na binding and the E*-E equilibrium.\n\nResidues W215, E217 and E192 control the allosteric E*-E equilibrium of thrombin\n\nPelc LA, Koester SK, Chen Z, Gistover NE and Di Cera E\n\nA pre-existing, allosteric equilibrium between closed (E*) and open (E) conformations of the active site influences the level of activity in the trypsin fold and defines ligand binding according to the mechanism of conformational selection. Using the clotting protease thrombin as a model system, we investigate the molecular determinants of the E*-E equilibrium through rapid kinetics and X-ray structural biology. The equilibrium is controlled by three residues positioned around the active site. W215 on the 215-217 segment defining the west wall of the active site controls the rate of transition from E to E* through hydrophobic interaction with F227. E192 on the opposite 190-193 segment defining the east wall of the active site controls the rate of transition from E* to E through electrostatic repulsion of E217. The side chain of E217 acts as a lever that moves the entire 215-217 segment in the E*-E equilibrium. Removal of this side chain converts binding to the active site to a simple lock-and-key mechanism and freezes the conformation in a state intermediate between E* and E. These findings reveal a simple framework to understand the molecular basis of a key allosteric property of the trypsin fold.\n\nProthrombin, or coagulation factor II, is a multidomain zymogen precursor of thrombin that undergoes an allosteric equilibrium between two alternative conformations, open and closed, that react differently with the physiological activator prothrombinase. Specifically, the dominant closed form promotes cleavage at R320 and initiates activation along the meizothrombin pathway, whilst the open form promotes cleavage at R271 and initiates activation along the alternative prethrombin-2 pathway. Here we report how key structural features of prothrombin can be monitored by limited proteolysis with chymotrypsin that attacks W468 in the flexible autolysis loop of the protease domain in the open but not the closed form. Perturbation of prothrombin by selective removal of its constituent Gla domain, kringles and linkers reveals their long-range communication and supports a scenario where stabilization of the open form switches the pathway of activation from meizothrombin to prethrombin-2. We also identify R296 in the A chain of the protease domain as a critical link between the allosteric open-closed equilibrium and exposure of the sites of cleavage at R271 and R320. These findings reveal important new details on the molecular basis of prothrombin function.", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "61d43bbd-31ce-4c32-ab65-aa5c08971f04", "url": "https://biochem.slu.edu/people/dicera/"}

At the\nsame time, margins on video shrank\nfrom 24.6% a year ago to 24.3%, suggesting\nto ISI Group analyst Vijay\nJayant that Dish is \"having difficulty\ntaking out recurring costs from its\nmodel despite subscriber growth being\nlighter than anticipated.\"\n\nSanford Bernstein cable and satellite\nanalyst Craig Moffett pointed to\nweak subscription revenue — at $3.2\nbillion, it was up 1.5% over last year\nbut was down 2.4% from the second\nquarter.\n\n\"Straight-line annualization of\nquarterly trends is never accurate\n(there are clear seasonality trends to\nconsider), but anything in the ballpark\nof a -10% annualized revenue\ngrowth rate for a subscription business\nis … well, terrifying,\" Moffett\nwrote.\n\nBut Ergen seemed to ease investors'\ngreatest fear — that Dish would\ncommit to a major investment in\nwireless broadband. It has already invested\nabout $2.8 billion to purchase\nspectrum.\n\nOn a conference call with analysts,\nErgen referred to rival DirecTV's strong third-quarter subscriber\ngrowth, adding that satellite is still the most efficient\ndelivery vehicle for video. \"We're just not getting our fair share\nof it yet,\" he said. In light of that disparity, Dish has to figure\nout other ways to capture revenue and customers.\n\n\"Consumers are consuming more bits and bytes of data,\nvideo and voice,\" Ergen said. \"Strategically, we believe we\nhave to be in something other than a standalone video business\nas a company. We are in the transition of being able to do\nthat. It's going to take some time.\"\n\nDish Network is still waiting for approval from the Federal\nCommunications Commission to combine the spectrum\nassets of acquired satellite operators DBSD North\nAmerica and TerreStar. While those hurdles don't appear\ntoo difficult for the satellite giant to clear, it still has to build\nthe network, which could cost billions of dollars.\n\nErgen has said in the past that he would prefer to partner\nwith another provider to build a wireless network — Sprint\nNextel has been speculated as the most likely choice — but on\nthe call last Monday he said he would be willing to go it alone.\n\n\"We would be a natural partner for some,\" Ergen said. \"But\nI believe there is a path for us to go it alone.\"\n\nAsked how he would value a business that has so much uncertainty,\nErgen said that was a problem for the analysts to\nfigure out.\n\n\"There is a tremendous business opportunity on the wireless\nside and on the macro side of wireless consumption,\" Ergen\nsaid. \"Every model assumes that the government wants\nto create jobs and the government wants to create competition.\nIf you believe that, there are a lot of ways for us to compete\nin the business beyond where we are today.\n\n\"We're in fixed video today,\" he added. \"We hope to get into\nthe mobile voice, data and video business and we will likely\ndo that in some kind of partnership, if we are allowed to do\nit. But it might not end up that way.\"", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "5e780b4a-2e36-46e8-a02f-14362494690a", "url": "https://www.multichannel.com/news/dishing-out-dividend-327140"}

People tell me that watching our show makes their day.\"\n\n\"I will credit the entire team for our #2 ranking behind Bhabhiji Ghar Par Hain. We have a great cast. Both Himani Shivpuri and Kamna Pathak, who play my on-screen mother and wife respectively, are excellent actors. I have worked with the former before. Even the young actors who are our kids are so good that sometimes I feel that I need to up my game to match them.\" Yogesh says, \"One of the things working for the show is the language; people love it. The same thing has worked in Bhabhiji as well. Plus, we have all the required elements — saas-bahu nok-jhok, kid tantrums, and yes, a ghost thrown in for good measure.\"\n\nPoint out that his wife is not pregnant in Happu Ki Ultan Paltan, as opposed to Bhabhiji Ghar Par Hain, and he says, \"I have no clue. Please ask the creative.\"\n\nOn the question as to why Happu Singh does not flirt with other women as he does in Bhabhiji, he says, \"Already Rajesh (wife) makes his life hell. Imagine what will happen if he crosses the line. On a more serious note, both shows are different. While Bhabhiji deals with Happu's bribe-taking cop's life in Modern Colony, here we show his personal life.\"\n\nLike most talented comic artists, Yogesh does not mind digs taken at him. \"People might consider me crazy, but as an artist, you feel your hard work has paid off when you bring a smile to people's faces.\"\n\n\"People often tell me that they enjoy it when Rajesh takes Happu's case. So we will have more such scenes added.\"\n\nIn closing, Yogesh, who has done a lot of episodes of FIR, says the creatives here \"Have made my character look very natural. No wonder you will see him wearing lungi, like people wear at home. I too make it a point to be as realistic as possible.

{"text": "More\n\nThe Echo Spot's video calling features are seriously good\n\nVideo calling is a breeze with Amazon's new gadgets. I'm usually critical of smart home accessories. I'm not a fan of the idea of putting a camera and microphone in every room of my home and having it watch me, my friends and family. I also don't think it's a great idea to let more and more devices into our lives that a single company has control over beyond even state authorities. But, the Drop In and Alexa-initiated video call features of the Echo Spot are compellingly good.\n\nThe Echo Spot review devices have arrived in our editorial office. The little brother of the Echo Show comes with a small display, simpler audio hardware, plus a small camera and a microphone array. This makes it suitable for on-demand video calling. This is only possible with Alexa devices and apps, though that turns out to be no obstacle after the first try.\n\nAfter several attempts to get along with the Amazon Echo family of devices, it has finally happened for me. The Echo Dot and Echo were nice attempts, but the weak speech recognition accuracy and lack of immediately apparent added value meant they never sat well with me.\n\nTo truly benefit from Alexa, I would have to deal with a whole string of add-on costs, like smart lights, thermostats, locks, and so on. Sure, those add a bit of convenience, but I'm not lazy enough to see the added value to justify the cost.\n\nOpinion by Eric Ferrari-Herrmann\n\nI'm not lazy enough for voice-controlled lighting.\n\nWhat do you think?\n\n50\n\n50\n\n171 participants\n\nAnd that's why I never saw a good reason to buy the Echo Dot. It can't use my music streaming service. It doesn't sync with my Google Calendar. And, I don't use any of Amazon's cloud service offerings. The entire Amazon ecosystem is unknown to me, and using an Amazon device totally throws me for a loop since I have to alter all of my ingrained habits. But now, a new Amazon product has come around that gives me a whole new perspective.\n\nInitially, Amazon tried to compel us to buy their screenless Echo devices. For people that hesitated, Echo Spot and Echo Show deliver immediate added value. Thanks to their screens, the value is more obvious to those who didn't see any reason to buy Amazon's previous hardware. Once you sync your address book, you can call up all of your friends. Thanks to the finally available display and built-in camera, you can see each other, too. The best thing about it is that you can reach your friends on the go with the Alexa app since it accept calls from Echo devices. If you say \"Alexa, call John Doe,\" it will ring on all of his devices.\n\nThe ecosystem remains closed\n\nWe were told at a press event that Amazon doesn't intend to open the feature up to third parties. So, we won't be needing a Skype, Telegram, or Hangouts skill: Amazon will keep video calling in its Alexa ecosystem. But, since the app works on almost all smartphones and has the feature available on it, and most people have an Amazon account already, there's not much of an adoption hurdle.\n\nIn fact, the calling features give users fresh incentive to install the Alexa app and give the assistant a shot, since the Alexa app isn't just a companion and set up tool for the Echo hardware anymore. Thanks to their displays, the Echo Show and Echo Spot can be set up without a smartphone anyway. The Alexa app finally lets you use the language assistant of the same name, on both Android smartphones and iPhones.\n\nIf it has been activated for the Echo device in question, you can simply switch on the camera via Drop In. Like an intercom system, the Echo Spot in a room can be spontaneously be activated, as if you were peeking through an open door.\n\nTo avoid embarrassing situations, the Drop In feature can be switched off (with the camera and microphone) by pressing a button. Anyone who calls will just see a message saying that the camera is disabled. While I think the idea of Drop In for the Echo Spot in a bedroom is problematic, I can imagine placing it in common areas like a hallway, kitchen or living room.\n\nIn the coming days, I will take a closer look at the new Alexa hardware. I still haven't checked out all the features, a list which has been getting longer over time. Until then, shoot me your questions and suggestions for things to include in the review of the Echo Dot.\n\nDo you already have a smart assistant at home? If so, how do you like it? Which features are missing so far?\n\nYou mean you don't have an internet-connected microphone in your pocket, like literally everyone? One that follows you on every intimate moment of your life, into every bathroom, every private meeting, and sits at your bedside? This perception is so common, and yet such logical tunnel vision", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "a26afc39-4c35-4cc4-8f14-fd73671b515a", "url": "https://www.androidpit.com/amazon-alexa-echo-video-call-drop-in?c=2558414"}

{"text": " Mowbray understands why Tony Pulis has identified pace and power as Middlesbrough's priority in the January transfer window.\n\nStanding in the opposition technical area on Saturday afternoon, Mogga got an up-close view of the side he still supports and acknowledged afterwards that there's a need for \"real speed and cutting edge\" to put the finishing touches to a team so solid at the back.\n\nPulis has made no secret of his January ambitions, talking repeatedly about the need for pace and width and on Friday he revealed that he'd been down in the capital this week for meetings as he looks to get the ball rolling ahead of the window.\n\nMowbray is obviously only concerned with Blackburn and his own January plans as Rovers look to build on a promising first half to their first season back in the Championship.\n\n\"Picture Traore on that pitch today, we're trying to break them down, it breaks to him and he runs 70 yards.\n\n\"He hasn't got him but he'll be looking hard to add that speed on the transition away from defensive positions.\"\n\nBritt Assombalonga was introduced from the bench at half-time on Saturday and made a statement with a stunning strike to snatch a point for the hosts, though Pulis was quick to point out afterwards that the striker missed a couple of clear cut chances.\n\nAssombalonga, though, will be hoping his contribution earns him some game-time in the coming weeks. The record striker has found himself on the fringes of late after Jordan Hugill established himself as Pulis's go-to man up-top.\n\nBritt Assombalonga celebrates with Jordan Hugill\n\nThe game against Blackburn raised further questions about Martin Braithwaite's future. He was left out of the squad all together with Pulis revealing afterwards that he felt Marcus Tavernier was more deserving of a spot on the bench, and said there was only room for one of the two.\n\nBraithwaite has insisted he's committed to the cause but his future is bound to be discussed at length in the coming weeks, though Pulis this week insisted nobody will be leaving the club until replacements are signed.", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "1d0b9e28-e1a0-41eb-a950-003d641565dd", "url": "https://www.gazettelive.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/tony-mowbray-gives-view-middlesbroughs-15526353"}

{"text": "Sunday, July 28, 2013\n\nFour athletes from Windham High School represented at the 24th annual Maine Shrine Lobster Bowl Classic. Football players Damien Shepard and Brandon Mitchell and cheerleaders Haley Williams and Cassidy Gaudet all played and cheered for the West team. They spent the week before the Saturday game training with athletes from all of the area, the once rivals coming together to raise money for Shriners hospitals.\n\n\"It was so great to see the East/West become rivals yet are such great friends,\" said parent Beth Gaudet. The football players were at Hebron Academy and the cheerleaders were at CMCC. The game took place in Biddeford last Saturday. Both East and West teams as well as their cheerleaders raised $94,000, the most ever, for Shriners hospitals.\n\nThe East beat the West for the first time in two years with a score of 25-13.\n\nFriday, July 26, 2013\n\nBETHEL-Already clinching the Zone 3 regular season first place spot, Windham took a long drive to play a game that meant nothing in the standings and lost to Locke Mills. Windham was missing several key players which could have made a difference in the outcome of this game.\n\nIn the first, Calvin Field led off with a single and stole second. He was driven in by Joey Francoeur to give Windham the early lead. Windham held Locke Mills scoreless for four innings as the Francoeur brothers pitched a combined four innings and allowed two hits. Windham hit the board again in the fourth as Joey Francoeur again reached base on a solid triple. Tanner Laberge drove him in with a solid double. Windham's scoring would cease after this.\n\nTanner Laberge took the hill in the fifth and the Locke Mills team took advantage. The first run was generated by a walk that advanced on stealing and an error by catcher Spencer Hodge. Then, Locke Mills just lit up Laberge and hit the ball where they wanted and generated two more runs to take the lead. In the fifth, the Windham team struggle at the plate and Locke Mills continued their hitting. They managed another two runs to seal the deal for the final game. That win earned Locke Mills a tie for sixth place in Zone 3 and gave them an opportunity to play on Saturday to enter the tournament. Windham held on to first place and played on Sunday based on the winner of Saturday's elimination game(s).\n\nWINDHAM-Windham defeated Locke Mills 4-1 to advance to the Zone 3 Tournament Final. Locke Mills had to win two games to play Windham. The first game on Saturday was to determine the number six seed. Then, Locke Mills defeated Bessey Motors to advance to face Windham. With some serious doubts about their available pitching depth, Windham still had to battle to earn the win. Things were even until the fifth inning. Windham hit the board after Calvin Field drew a walk and stole second base. Field advanced to third on Spencer Hodge's sacrifice. Joey Francoeur then launched a deep double that scored Field. Shawn Francoeur hit a single to drive in his brother to give Windham the 2-0 lead. Locke Mills attempted a threat when the plated a run in the sixth. However, the threat was short lived. Windham's Alex Loftis drew a walk in the eighth. He advanced to third on Nate Boyle's at bat that resulted in an error. Cody Dube came to bat and dropped a bunt that turned into a sacrifice play. Loftis scored and Boyle advanced. With two outs, Calvin Field reached on an error by the third baseman to score Boyle.\n\nWith the win, Windham faces Past-Time (Lewiston) in the Zone 3 Championship in Windham last Monday night. The winner gets an automatic bid to the state tournament in Augusta on July 31. The other team has a play-in game on Saturday, July 27 to get in to the tournament. Lewiston defeated Auburn to advance to the tournament final.\n\nWINDHAM-As of Monday night, Windham and Past-Time (Lewiston) battled to a dead even 11-11 tie after ten innings. Despite the start time of 4:30 p.m, this game would need extra time.\n\nLewiston got on the board quickly when catcher Alex Small hit a single and stole second. Corbin Hyde singled in Small. Windham wasted little time making their offense known as well. Calvin Field led off with a walk and stole second and third. Spencer Hodge also drew a walk. With runners at the corners, Joey Francoeur flied out deep to center and Field tagged up and scored. Hodge stole second and was driven home on Dennis Meehan's deep fly ball to right field. After one, Windham had the 2-1 lead. Windham held Lewiston scoreless in the second. With one out, Ethan Petty hit a single and advanced when Zach Conley reached base on an error. Calvin Field blistered a deep shot to center to drive in Petty and Conley and land him on third. Field scored on Spencer Hodge's hit to give Windham the early 5-1 lead. Lewiston countered in the third when Corbin Hyde launched a ball over the fence to record a run for Lewiston. In the bottom frame, with one out, Tanner Laberge and Nate Boyle both drew walks. Ethan Petty batted a single in to drive Laberge in. After three, it was 6-2.\n\nBrian Wigant of Lewiston started the fourth with a walk and quickly stole second. Mike Wong batted him in with a single. Leadoff hitter, Luke Cote, drove Wong in with a single to narrow the Windham lead to two runs. In the bottom of the fourth, Windham's Dennis Meehan led off with a walk and Shawn Francoeur was hit by a pitch to put two runners on. Tanner Laberge hit a single to drive Meehan in. Windham's lead gap had shrunk by one at the end of the inning. The fifth inning was not starting pitcher Cody Dube's inning. Dube gave up three hits and Windham committed two errors to give Lewiston four runs and the lead. In the bottom of the fifth, Ethan Petty reached on a single. With one out, Calvin Field drove another deep ball for a triple. The relay from center field was on the mark and Petty was thrown out attempting home. Spencer Hodge reached base on an error and Field scored to tie the game at 8.\n\nThe ninth inning saw some different baseball as Lewiston went to the short game (bunting) to create runs and take a three-run lead. In the bottom of the inning, Windham again answered the call. With one out, Ethan Petty hit a triple. Andrew Whiting and Calvin Field drew walks to load the bases. Spencer Hodge grounded into a fielder's choice, but Petty scored. Joey Francoeur drew a walk to again load the bases. Dennis Meehan lined a single to drive in Whiting and Field to again tie the game. Due to diminished light, the game was suspended after ten complete innings. Play continued tonight for the Zone 3 Legion championship. Nate Boyle took the hill for Windham and performed almost flawlessly. Boyle, with help from his defense kept Past-Time off the board. However, Past-Time shuffled their pitchers in and out using Luke Cote and Corbin Hyde to contain Windham. In the twelfth, Windham had bases loaded with one out and couldn't put the winning run across.\n\nIn the top of the sixteenth, Boyle came out to pitch. After he delivered, Lewiston called timeout. After a conference with the home plate umpire, the Zone 3 commissioner was asked to come on the field. After the commission examined Windham's books, the game was immediately ended and Windham Forfeited for using an ineligible pitcher. Legion rules are clear about pitcher's rest time. A pitcher my only pitch twelve innings in three days. Boyle had thrown seven on Sunday against Locke Mills. When Boyle came out and delivered in the sixteenth, he actually reached the 13 inning mark in three days. Later Wednesday night, the State Commissioner was called in after Windham filed a protest saying the game should not have been forfeited.\n\nFriday update: Windham will remain runners-up after the final ruling of the game should not have been forfeited and the initial call was incorrect. However, the protest had to be lodged while the umpires were still on the field and that wasn't the case here.\n\nWeekend walks with the dogs are our ritual. They signal the beginning of the weekend, two precious days to focus on our family and our home and decompress from the week at work. For the dogs, the weekend means two days of fun, adventure and our devoted attention. Typically, we start at Black Brook Preserve. The first trail we explored when we moved to Windham, it remains our favorite. In a year of hiking, we've only encountered two other sets of dogs and their people, and one day we met people from The Windham Land Trust doing maintenance.\n\nIt's so quiet there that my husband gave me the one-eyebrow-up, I'm-not-sure-this-is-your-best-idea look when I started writing this. We start from the Windham Center Road, walk past wildflowers and head into the woods. The hiking is slowly uphill until we reach a huge boulder, climb a little more and scurry downhill and around to where beavers have dammed the brook and creating a large, gray pond. There is usually evidence of their work along the trail. Bullfrogs croak and birds rustle around in the plants along the water's edge, confounding the dogs, who aren't sure if they want to investigate those noises or hurry past. It's a little wet in the middle of the trail, but there is a series of well-maintained bridges to keep our feet dry, although the dogs reliably opt for the wet-and-muddy route.\n\nTrails criss-cross the 105-acre Black Brook Preserve, allowing hikers to choose routes of a variety of lengths. The mid-length route is our favorite (we take the Diamond Trail to the Hawkes Trail and follow that back to Diamond), giving us and the dogs a nice bit of exercise over about two miles of rising and falling terrain. The trail runs through beautiful woods underlain with ferns and shrubs. Though the parcel touches Roosevelt Trail and Route 202, it's largely quiet except for the sounds of birds and frogs; just a little road noise is audible along parts of the trail. It offers a nice reprieve from the hustle and bustle of the highways in town. The preserve feels very well established. Some of the trees are clearly quite old and one gets the sense that the trails have been walked and the ambiance enjoyed millions of times by those with a deep appreciation for nature. The Windham Land Trust's website ( says Black Brook Preserve is open for hiking, horseback riding, cross-country skiing and snowmobiling, which is limited to certain sections.\n\nWindham Boy Scout Troop 805 recently had an exciting overnight rafting trip on the Kennebec River at Three Rivers Whitewater Rafting in The Forks, Maine. Kevin Day, an assistant Scoutmaster for 805, said he knew the rapids could throw a person out of the raft, but he did not expect it to happen. \"Our day on the river started with an exciting, yet tense situation,\" Day began. \"The first set of rapids we encountered were so strong that one of the rafters behind us was thrown from his boat. He was able to float down through a dangerous section of the river using his lifejacket, but was unable to reach his guide for rescue. Day continued, \"Fortunately, one of the Troop 805 rafts was in a back-eddie close to the rafter. The Scouts and Scout leaders were able to pull the man into their boat and rescue him. They floated down river and returned him to his boat where he got medical attention for cuts and scrapes on his legs. And this was all in the first ten minutes of the trip!\" Boy Scouts on the trip were Aiden Day, Kevin Ingalls, Dean Preston, Tyler Lewis, Owen Watson, Ezra Stevens and Tucker Labbe.\n\nThe scouts camped out in two, eight-man cabins and played Frisbee in the big field at the camp. After a campfire, they settled into their bunks. The next day, the rafting over 14 miles of the Kennebec River began. The first river section the Scouts rafted was called \"Taster,\" because it gives you a little taste of how the whitewater feels. Next, the troop went down \"Big Mama.\" One Scout, Aiden Day said he got a thrill on this stretch.\"Big Mama was harder, but was one of the most fun ones. I was in the front along with Owen Watson and on that run we got splashed a ton! One time I even went flying in the air, but managed to stay on the raft.\" Paul Preston, an assistant scoutmaster, said he enjoyed the start of the trip the most. \"My favorite part of the day was at the beginning when we went down the stairs with our raft, seeing the river and seeing everyone's anticipation to go down the river,\" he said. According to American Whitewater, a non-profit organization, the incidence of commercially guided rafting fatalities is estimated to range from one death per 250,000 person visits for an individual raft trip.\" There have only been 10 reported deaths in Maine from whitewater trips since 1975. Acute rafting injuries are most often due to contact with another rafter's paddle or other equipment. The next most common injury is the rafter hitting an object while \"swimming.\"\n\nSaturday, July 20, 2013\n\nRAYMOND -On Sunday, July 14, the District 6 Junior League Softball Tournament Championship game was held and the Raymond/Windham squad defeated Portland 1-0, in their first year of competition.\n\nLeading the team was pitcher Dani Tardif who struck out ten in seven innings of work and was supported well by her defense. Dani only allowed one hit during the game. Raymond/Windham's run came in the second inning. Lilly MacPherson led things off by being hit by a pitch. MacPherson stole second to set up the winning run. Suzanne Butterfield ripped a shot into the outfield to score MacPherson.\n\nRaymond/Windham tried a few times to score an insurance run, but was foiled. In the seventh inning, Butterfield reached on a single. Jaycee Hovey dropped a sacrifice bunt to move Butterfield. Butterfield managed to get to third on an error by the shortstop. Katie Hunter drove the ball hard to the third baseman and Butterfield attempted to get home, but was thrown out at the plate.\n\nIn the tournament, Raymond/Windham had previously defeated Portland in a come from behind win. Being down 5-3 in the seventh, the team managed to score four runs to defeat Portland to remain in the winner's bracket.\n\nThe Raymond/Windham squad will face Biddeford in Biddeford for the State of Maine Junior Softball Championship Friday, July 19 and Sunday, July 21.\n\nCorrection from the coach:\n\nThe winning run was\nscored on a fielders choice hit by Stefi Daniels that scored the only and\nwinning run.\n\nWINDHAM-Windham Merchants racked up another win over Tri-Town in Zone 3 American Legion Baseball action on Thursday, July 11. Windham defeated the Tri-Town team 2-0.\n\nJoey Francoeur took the hill for Windham to start the game. He pitched five solid innings before giving up to reliever Cody Dube. Windham put runs up in the second when Joey Francoeur reached base on a walk. With one out, Tanner Laberge roped a single to put runners at the corners. Ethan Petty came to bat and crushed a ball deep to the outfield to record a double and plate Francoeur and Laberge to give Windham all they would need to win the game. The game was threatened by dark skies and distant rumbles of thunder. However, the game was able to be completed and was finished with a fine rainbow presentation at the end. Windham next faces Andy Valley on Saturday July 13.\n\nWINDHAM -Andy Valley came to Windham hoping to improve their one win record. The Windham Merchants had other plans in play as they upended the visitors two times with 7-0 scores.\n\nIn game one, starting pitcher Shawn Francoeur went four innings, striking out six to lead Windham to the victory. In relief, Sam Pattee took the hill for two and Tanner Laberge finished in the seventh for Windham.\n\nOffensively, Windham's Calvin Field led game one off with a dribbler single to set up the game winning run. Field stole second to get in scoring position. Spencer Hodge drove a ball deep to right center to move Field to third. Dennis Meehan batted Field in despite being put out to record the run. Joey Francoeur came to bat and put up a nice single. Brother Shawn drove him in with a hard shot to the outfield. Francoeur tried to get an extra base and was thrown out at third.\n\nIn the second, Tanner Laberge hit a nice shot to the outfield to record a double. On the next play, Nate Boyle hit a ball that caught Laberge in a run down. Laberge would be put out and Boyle remained on base. Boyle stole second on a wild throw and advanced to third on a passed ball. Zach Conley drew a walk to put runners at the corners. Andrew Whiting ripped a single to drive Boyle in. Calvin Field came to bat and drove a ball deep to center field to drive Zach Conley in.\n\nIn the third, Shawn Francoeur reached base on a fielder's choice. Tanner Laberge hit a single to advance Francoeur. Nate Boyle reached base on an error that scored Francoeur to give Windham the five run lead. Windham added two more in the sixth when Zach Conley drew a walk and Calvin Field drove a double deep to the outfield to score Conley. Field was then driven in by reliever Sam Pattee to record the final run.\n\nGame two saw Calvin Field draw a walk to start Windham's attack. Field stole second and advanced on Spencer Hodge's fly out to right field. Dennis Meehan drove Field in to score the game winning run. In the second, Alex Loftis reached base on a single and scored a run when Calvin Field hit a double to plate him. In the fifth, Calvin Field led off with a single and scored on Spencer Hodge's double. Dennis Meehan followed with a base hit to put runners at the corners. Ethan Petty drove in Hodge with a single. Tanner Laberge followed with a fielder's choice that plated Dennis Meehan to give Windham the 5-0 lead.\n\nIn the sixth, Alexis Loftis lead off with a single. Calvin Field followed with a single to drive in Loftis. Dennis Meehan hit a single to drive Field in to finish Windham's scoring.\n\nThe Windham Eagle athlete of the week is 13-year-old Cameron McCartney who attends Windham Middle School.\n\n\"Cam was nominated because he had a good WMS season on the mound. He batted at around .600 and his OBP was .750 and his slugging percentage was 1.000.\n\nHe had a great season this past spring on and off the field,\" said his coach. Cameron said he couldn't live without baseball and hopes he can get into a good college where he can play baseball. He also plays soccer.\n\nHis hobbies are playing baseball, hanging out with my friends and fishing. Cameron lives with his parents Michelle and James McCartney and his two brothers Caleb and Cayden.\n\nBest way to unwind after competition: Having a good meal and relaxing for the day.\n\nOXFORD-Despite the heat and humidity, baseball continues and Windham showed their best in defeating Bessey Motors 3-0 on Tuesday.\n\nWindham's ace hurler, Cody Dube, had the hill for Windham and went the distance striking out five and allowing three hits in the shutout.\n\nWindham got on the board in the third inning when Nate Boyle led off with a double. Andrew Whiting followed with a single. With one out, Calvin Field drew a walk to load the bases. Spencer Hodge hit the ball right at the third baseman and he delivered the ball to home to get Boyle out on the force play. With two outs, Joey Francoeur drove a sharp single to drive in Whiting and Field to give Windham the edge they needed to win the game.\n\nIn the seventh, Calvin Field drew a walk. In a pickoff attempt, with the sun in the first baseman's eyes, the throw was not caught and traveled far into foul territory. Field advanced to third on the errant throw. Joey Francoeur drove in his third run of the game when he crushed a ball deep to right field. On the tag up, Calvin Field scored the final run.\n\nWindham faced Locke Mills in Bethel on July 18 and then hosts a team on Sunday for the Zone 3 Legion Tournament. The Legion State Tournament is being held in Augusta this year.\n\nUnfortunately, the fat loss game is more frustrating than most care to admit. The scale quickly becomes a dreaded enemy—a constant bearer of bad news.\n\nIf the number on your scale won't budge, then read on for some reasons why:\n\nPossibility #1: You're not eating enough calories This only happens in cases of severe calorie restriction, so don't take it as a license to eat whatever you'd like. When you're trying to drop a few pounds by eating next to nothing, it actually counteracts your efforts. There are a base number of calories that you should be eating in order to maintain your proper bodily functions, including fat loss, so check with your health coach to make sure that you're eating enough.\n\nPossibility #2: You're eating too many carbs Processed carbs will promote fat storage quicker than you can say the alphabet. Blood sugar and insulin levels always respond the same to processed carbs.\n\nYou're fooling yourself, but not your scale, if you think processed carbs should be included in your fat loss diet.\n\nPossibility #3: You're doing too much cardio If you're doing hours of steady-state cardio, it's going to end up working against your fat loss efforts. All that cardio promotes the release of stress hormones in your body, which counteracts your ability to lose fat. See a trainer about designing your ideal exercise routine for maximum fat loss. I'll let you know how much cardio should be included in your routine.\n\nPossibility #4: You're not getting enough sleep You may not see the connection between your sleep patterns and the number on your scale, but it's there. Sleep patterns have an impact on your hormone levels, and hormones are a huge factor when it comes to losing fat.\n\nBe sure to get a full eight hours of sleep each night to boost your fitness results.\n\nPossibility #5: Your snacks have no protein Small, whole foods snacks throughout the day can help maintain your metabolism and encourage fat loss, but it all depends on what you're snacking on. Fruit-only snacks quickly break down to sugar, which causes insulin to be released and potential fat storage to occur, much like when you eat processed carbs. Sure, the fruit will make less of an impact than a candy bar. However, you should be snacking smarter.\n\nOnly eat snacks that contain the correct portion of protein to carbs, with some healthy fat. This will help to stabilize your blood sugar levels while also keeping hunger at bay longer. Possibility #6: You eat diet foods I get it. You have a fat loss goal so it's tempting to fall into the trap of purchasing foods that claim to help dieters. The problem lies in the fact that these \"diet\" products have been highly processed and contain potentially harmful chemicals and artificial sweeteners that will confuse your hormones and promote fat storage.\n\nThe best diet strategy, when working towards a fitness goal, is to stick with real, fresh, whole foods. Steer clear of anything fake or processed. Don't wait another week, another day, or even another hour to take action.\n\nGlenn Hutchinson runs On the Go Health and Wellness Coaching for Busy People in Raymond.

But, I knew that there was plenty of baseball in my future. So, Friday morning, my friend, Cliff Knight and I headed to our camp in T8R4. It is also known as the Hawkins Brook Palace. The locals, the few that are there, refer to it as just \"the palace\". We are talking about a small one room cabin with an outhouse to do your business in. However, this structure and others before it have been on the property for almost 100 years. There are still berms from where the original campers had their horse pen. They used to come in by horse and carriage to hunt and fish.\n\nSo, with the history behind us, we arrived around 11 a.m. and unpacked. We had lunch and then went on a wood mission. We filled the back of the truck shortly with various blow downs and other wood remnants allowed by our lease. We got back to camp, cut it up, split and stacked it. So, with a little lactic acid in the arms, we then ventured to Hawkins Brook to see if the brook trout were biting.\n\nWe parked the truck, dragged the canoe to Pine Knoll Landing as we call it and ventured up Hawkins, back towards the camp. We portaged around a very tall beaver dam and continued on to a much higher brook than we have been used to. Finding Staples Trout Hole, Russell's Hole and the Elm Works Brook inlet were a tough job. All three spots have produced trout in the past. We were fishing with earthworms and were only catching the ever abundant chubs. Disheartened, we paddled back to Pine Knoll. We followed a very large beaver from Staples Trout Hole back to the beaver hut. That beaver was very, very large. We got back to camp and had a simple macaroni and cheese with hot dog dinner. We finished with an outside campfire and soon our muscles began to ache from the work we had done.\n\nUp early, we managed a sausage and egg breakfast before hitting the brook again in hopes of landing some brookies. However, after fishing for over three hours, we were skunked. We packed up and headed back to camp for lunch. We finished cutting and stacking wood for our fall hunting season. We did some camp clean up and then headed to a pit about three miles away. We did some skeet shooting and had some fair sparring between us as to who was better. We returned to camp to finish the day with a potato and onion in tinfoil combo with grilled moose meat and salad.\n\nThis camp is located three miles from an asphalt road. The cell service is okay, but not consistent. We have hunted bear, partridge, moose and deer from this camp. I call it my decompression location. It is a simplified way of living and ever relaxing. The photos I have presented remind me of the late Bill Silliker. As he used to say, \"Catch yours in the good light.\"\n\nSaturday, July 13, 2013\n\nThe U16G Seacoast United Mariners soccer team is headed to the US Club Soccer National Cup XII Finals from July 18-21, 2013 in Aurora, CO. This talented group of young ladies, which features some of the top premier players in Maine, won the US Club National Cup XII Northeast Regional over Memorial Day weekend in LaGrangeville, NY, shutting-out their opponents 16-0 over 4 games. This will be the Mariners second try in less than a year at a national title — they made it to the final championship round of the United Soccer League Super-Y Nationals this past December where they conceded to a talented Atlanta team. Members of the team hail from across the state—Windham having the most representation with six players. They include forwards Melissa Morton and Jenna Soucy, mid-fielders Cassie Symonds and Shannon Valente, defender Jordan Symonds, and goalkeeper Elizabeth Mycock. The Seacoast United Mariners are coached by James Blackwell. The Mariners have competed in 42 games since their season began in late November—with a record of 28-9-5.\n\nWindham's 11 year old all-star team started off strong in the tournament against Gray-New Gloucester. Windham's bats were hot and the defense was just as hot as they defeated the neighboring team 14-0 in a lightning delayed four-inning match on Friday, July 5. Windham then faced Falmouth and lost 5-1 on Saturday, July 6. Windham plays next on Wednesday, July 10 in an elimination game against Yarmouth. The 9-10 Baseball team defeated Westbrook 1-0 to advance to the District 6 Championship game, which they won for the second year in a row this year they played Scarborough. The banner presentation was held Wednesday night at Lowell Field.\n\nBRUNSWICK-On July 3, a hot and steamy afternoon didn't stop the Windham squad at all as they took game one 11-0. Calvin Field led off with a walk and was quickly driven in by Tanner Laberge's double to score the winning run. Jack Herzig swapped places with Laberge to quickly give Windham the 2-0 lead. Jack Herzig swapped places with Laberge to put Windham up 3-0 in the first. Herzig eventually scored on a passed ball and Spencer Hodge drew a walk. Hodge was driven in by Shawn Francoeur to end the first inning scoring. Windham struck again in the third and fifth innings to bring the game to a mercy end. Shawn Francoeur threw an almost perfect game for Windham to record the victory. Game two saw Windham get on top and not look back. Nate Boyle led off with a single and stole second and third to set up Windham's first run. Boyle scored on a passed ball to give Windham the early lead and the eventual winning run. With two out, Alex Loftis drew a walk, stole second and advanced to third and home on passed balls to put another run on the board for Windham. In the third, the whole lineup contributed to scoring with either base hits, walks, or scoring on passed balls. The Windham squad took advantage of every opportunity Brunswick handed them. In the fifth, Alex Loftis reached on a single. Shawn Francoeur drove a ball deep to the outfield to drive Loftis in. With nothing to lose, coach Brody Artes waived Francoeur around the third base in an attempt to get another run. Francoeur was thrown out easily at the plate to end the inning. With thunder rumbling nearby, the umpires called the game and it was a welcome relief to the humid conditions the boys were in.\n\nFriday, July 12, 2013\n\nAUBURN-Windham defeated Rogers Post 12-1 to take sole possession of first place in Legion Zone 3 standings. Rogers hit the board first in the bottom of the first inning. Leadoff batter, Nate Blais hit a double and was sacrificed to third. Blais found home after tagging up after Josh Delong flew out to center field. Windham quickly answered in the second. Tanner Laberge got on with a single, stole second and Zach Conley drove him in with a single. After a couple of quick, scoreless innings, Windham's bats generated some runs. Calvin Field led the inning off with a single and stole second. Spencer Hodge hit a single to drive Field in. Joey Francoeur hit a single to advance Hodge to third. With two out, Jack Herzig drove in Hodge and Francoeur. Tanner Laberge drew a walk. Ethan Petty roped a double to drive in Herzig and Laberge. In the top of the seventh, Windham once again proved that they play a full game of baseball. In the inning, Dennis Meehan, Alex Loftis, Jack Herzig, Tanner Laberge, Ethan Petty and Zach Conley all scored. Nate Boyle pitched the whole game for Windham and recorded four strikeouts. Windham's next three games are at home. They faceTri-Town (Poland, Mechanic Falls and Minot) on Thursday and have a double header against Andy Valley on Saturday starting at 9:30 a.m. at Windham High School.\n\nWINDHAM-After losing two to Lewiston, Windham came ready to play Sunday afternoon and handed Smith-Tobey an 8-0 loss. Shawn Francoeur pitched a three-hitter in the shutout. Windham got on the board when Shawn Francoeur reached on a single and was driven in by Alex Loftis in the second inning. In the fifth, Calvin Field led off with a double, Jack Herzig followed with a single and Joey Francoeur drove both of them in with a double. In the bottom of the sixth, Nate Boyle started things off with a triple and Alex Loftis drove him in with a double. Spencer Hodge drew a walk and Calvin Field hit a single to drive Loftis in. With two out, Joey Francoeur hit a triple to drive Hodge and Field in. Brother Shawn drove in Joey to finish the scoring in the game.\n\nLEWISTON- With steamy conditions and little relief, the Windham Merchants fell to rival Past-Time 6-5 and 5-1. In game one, Past-Time jumped out quickly to take a 3-0 lead in game one. In the second inning, Nate Boyle drove Joey Francoeur in to get Windham on the board. Past Time answered in the bottom frame when Luke Cote and Mike Wong both scored to make the score 5-1. Windham showed their resiliency. In the top of the third, Calvin Field drew a walk and stole second. Andrew Whiting drove Field in to add another run. In the bottom of the sixth, Past-Time's Gage Cote was driven in by Luke Cote to up the team's score to six. In the top of the seventh, Windham does what they do best, the came back. However, this comeback fell short. Calvin Field, Tanner Laberge and Andrew Whiting each hit singles and scored runs. Nate Boyle took the hill for Windham and wasn't at the top of his game. Boyle lasted two innings and was relieved by Joey Francoeur for three innings and Sam Pattee for one.\n\nIn game two, Luke Cote's name was again at the top of the Lewiston squads scoring list. Cote scored three runs to lead Past-Time over Windham. Cody Dube pitched four innings and left the game after he aggravated his back. Windham managed one run in the fourth when Dennis Meehan drew a walk and Joey Francoeur crushed a triple, driving Meehan in.", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "252551e1-937f-411a-923b-cb354727fdc1", "url": "http://sports.thewindhameagle.com/2013/07/"}

{"text": "Hello fellow weed heads, hope your day is blessed! I was a member here in the ole days, finally found my way back to the site, had no clue it was back up and running. Been hanging out at another place, VERY small, VERY cool, but little goes on there, and trading back n forth between members is frowned upon(shame on you!) . Really like the fact it is \"open\" here, like it always was.\n\nRun pretty much indoors these days. Being in Texas, the outside is just too damn hot, and too humid for the ladies. I invested in a greenhouse 3 years ago, the Texas sun and weather has already destroyed it, and I am sick of fighting PM outside with our average summer humidity of 85% or more. I can no longer trust my loved strains outside, so from now on it will pretty much be all inside .\n\n3 years ago I filled my 10x8 x10 Gorilla tent with all my favorites(Goji, Chucky's Bride, C99, Amnesia Haze, Sugar Punch) fired up all 3 of my Gavita DE HPS FLAME THROWERS…and harvested so much bud I shut down for 2.5 years, until all my jars became pretty empty. I did not keep Mothers, so I am starting fresh again.\n\nGoji is by far my favorite bud, my original keeper was just superb. She was found in an 11 pack, and to be real honest, EVERY female from that pack DELIVERED the goods! My keeper was kept because of her yield and vigor, all 6 ladies from my 1st run of her were VERY similar. I go on a HUNT for Goji seeds, HOW I found the site here!\n\nNo original Goji beans were to be found, but luckily I had hit a clone of my Mom with a lovely Holy Grail Kush male. 6 months ago I had a month supply of weed left, so i quickly threw down a run, 12/12 from seed, to have some Bud. I had 5 different GojixHGK in that short run, 4 of the 5 were KILLER!!! Same Goji traits, same killer high, but now with beautiful \"Kush\" aftertaste on the exhale. With some Bud in the jars, i set up for my \"normal\" runs. 1 Mother screen, 1 BIG screen.\n\nSince I was coming from seed, and all reg seeds to boot, it was like starting all over again. Goji HAD to be in the mix, so I placed 5 of them(my cross, GxHGK) in the Mom run. I also placed 2 Boudica's, a Caramel Candy Kush, and a friends creation Cloudwatcher.\nOn my \"Mom\" screen, I am pheno hunting. All were cut n trained, cuts taken from them and labeled , then they are sent to flower. I took a \"GUESS\" and placed 4 cuts into my Octopot's to be run on my big screen. Both runs are concurrent, with the Mom screen obviously ahead of the big screen.\n\nSo, I have the Mom screen going, turned small, as I said pheno hunting on that screen. I have the big screen 4 foot by 4 foot. Mom screen is at like day 30, the 4x4 screen was just \"flipped\" 7 days ago. Then I have a \"veg\" \"holding\" room, with all the cuts from the Mom screen, and some seedlings for my next run(Sugar Punch X Goji) . Getting crowded, be nice when the Mom's come down, and I can reduce my holdings…lol.\n\nThe small screen is run under T5 H.O. lighting. NEVER flowered under a T5, so will be interesting to see the outcome. They are at 30 days in the pic's, doing well. T5's are INCHES off their heads, light meter tells me PLENTY of PAR !!!\n\nThere are 5 different GojiX HOly Grail Kush's, 2 different Chucky's Bride's(Chucky's Bride is a cross of Exodus Cheese and Cinderella 99 bred by Eskobar ) a CCK, and my buddies \"CloudWatcher\"…too involved for me to remember it's lines off top of my head, but she is 5 of Sannie's strains, crossed, back crossed, crossed again, then 100 placed down for a pheno hunt. Superbly stout weed, 10 weeks done, great yields. Actually the ones I am growing are that plant, crossed to his favorite Stardog. WHY…WTFK…lol…why not!!!\nThe picture shows exactly 1/2 of that Mom screen.\n\nMy 'Big\" screen is a 4 foot by 4 foot SCROG, being lit by a Gavita DE 750 HPS …the finest light in the industry to my thinking.\n1 of these, when cranked up to 825 watts(adj…400/500/600/750/825) will fully cover my 4x4 screen with all the light the ladies can use. I place on a light mover, only going back n forth a few feet, BUT, it lets me place the light at 1.5 feet instead of 30 inches or so,with NO BLEACHING or ill effects(you will see that in a minute) . I run the big screen with \"Octopot's\". I am an OCTOPOT MAN through n through…would have to pry them from my cold dead fingers. It is a bottom feeding, self wicking system with a 6 gallon grow bag, and 6 gallon rez on the bottom. THEY RULE!!! 100 % organic soil I mix myself, feed ONLY Texas Vegetable Fertilizer in veg, and ONLY Texas Tomato Food during flower, organic too, and made here in Texas. NEVER any issues with the plants using this setup, and HUGE yields.\n\nOctopots water for me, they are filled through the rez, and in FULL ON FLOWER POWER a big plant in one of these will suck 4 PLUS gallons a day from the rez!!! My last Goji run(I have pics) the big lady, went 7 foot tall, 7 foot wide, weighed 14 pounds wet when chopped, and yielded 1.2 pouds of DRIED bud! That was my original Goji cut I have lost, NOT the cross I am running now.\n\nThis is the big screen…7 days into my turn. 4 plants in 4 Octopots. 1 in each corner. 2 closest to the camera are my Goji cross, back left is a Chucky's Bride (Escobar's) , back right, the PIECE O SHIT Cloudwatcher!!! lol\n\nThe 2 Goji's are about to run over the other 2…I could kick myself for placing the Chucky and the Cloudwatcher on this screen…4 of my Goji cross's would have lit up this screen! The Chucky is weak(ALWAYS LIMP WRISTED PLANTS) and the CloudWatcher x StarDog is just plain pathetic…LMAO!!!\n\nMy friend sent me Sugar Punch x Goji seeds! He made them, but has never thrown any down. I threw down 8, have 8 VERY healthy n happy hybrid vigor lil plants!!! I also have a cut from a friend, NAPALI PINK. The GojiSP and the Napali will be my next \"Mom\" screen. If you do not KNOW Sugar Punch, your a loser…lol…just kidding, comes from small breeder not too well known, but VERY respected.\n\nWell, that gets me caught up. Hope the pics worked out right, if not, I will figure it out.\n\nEVERYONE is welcome in here, as all my threads will be OPEN!!! I LOVE to trade, swap, talk 420, and at 65 years old, been doing it some time now. I am NOT in a legal state, maybe the worst state for our hobby, but been doing it since 1970 without any issues or POPO visits…\n\nStop in, say hello, leave me a comment. I will keep this journal current, and all my current runs will be placed in here.\nTo the 2 or 3 that have already contacted me…THANKS for the WELCOME!!! Place feels like HOME already.\n\nNIce plants and intro post. Welcome to the forums. I've seen you a bunch over on the other og. Jealous of those Octopots. I heard everyone hyping them up and finally found a good deal that I saved for later. Went to finally buy 4 of them to test out and the damn place didn't ship to Canada lol\n\nWish I was around to get some of the older esko stuff too before it disappeared. Look forward to seeing more of your grows in the future.\n\nThanks bro!!!\nOcto's rule!!! I BEGGED the boys to run them over there…NOW, 5 or 6 of us are using them…\n\nIf you like STINKY TASTY POWERFUL Bud…Esko had it!!! I LOVE his Chucky's Bride…she is superior in flavor taste and high…BUT…she grows like a retarded child with palsy and yields nothing. Straight head stash is what I grow her for. Have F2's I made(from 1 single SEED!!! Threw 2 plants from it, grew out together, 1 male 1 female…let him whack his sister,lol) you can run. From my last run of them, 50% were the pheno you want, 50% were a waste to grow, so it is hit n miss with her. I do have a couple in my Mom screen too…and when finished, I will keep a Mom of her. You may have a cut at that point if you would like.\n\nThis is the Goji that went LARGE. She is the plant back left, in an Octopot. ALL the others are in regular pots,\nthey ARE ALL THE SAME AGE!!!\nLook at that pic, THEN TRY n tell me Octopot's do not work…LMAO!!!\nShe was turned 5 days after this pic, ended up taking 1/2 of that huge tent for herself.\n\nTanks man, appreciate it. If I had built my big scrog with all Goji instead of only 1/2 of it, 4 weeks from now we would be looking at a stellar looking carpet…but NO…I had to throw 2 limp wristed bitch's in there, and it is not going to be the prettiest screen in town…I should have yanked the 2 out, then let the Goji have another 2 weeks of veg time to fill their spots too. Since I have flipped them a week ago, cant do it now. You would think at age 65 and doing this since I was 14 I WOULD HAVE A CLUE…lmao…but NOPE, just a stupid stoner …\n\nSo, go upstairs to water the little ones. Notice a few things, lol. The cut of CWXSD, vegging under the T5's\nwith all the other cuts from the \"Mom\" screen, looks like SHIT. Not doing poorly, under or over feed/watered, just a shitty looking plant. Never fails, lol, I get 20 seeds of this cross from my friend, the 1 seed I pick to throw into this run is the weak sister. The thing has POOR structure(will NOT let me train her) and just grows like crap. It goes up 12 inches or so, then just STOPS!!! Driving me nuts because a cut from this same lame plant is in my 4x4 screen that was just turned. I am getting crowed in the temp Mom room, and have stuff inbound that will need space in there. I was going to chuck her out, and say See YA…but since I have her on the little Mom screen, AND the big 4x4, i figured I go look at those 2 first, then make a decision.\n\nMy 4x4 screen is getting filled in, even though 2 of the 4 plants under it are NOT pulling their own weight. The Goji Holy Grail Kush ladies are kicking it big time, the Chucky's Bride(SUCH A POOR POOR POOR choice for this screen) is doing what she does, nothing… …what was I thinking…(was probably stoned on bubble hash when I mentally constructed this screen, lol) …she is branching like sea corral, with stem diameter's of your hair…she will end up just laying on the screen growing sideways 'bout week 7 I would guess. My friends(soon to be X,lol) Cloudwatcher x StarDog is just …well, do not know how to put it…an embarrassment. How I let this POS stay in the scrog is beyond me. Looks like a 4th grader grew her for a science project…and he received a D- ! Then threw it out, and I salvaged it from the garbage can. The screen is like 9 inches off the buckets top, maybe 11 forgot, but she has barely reached the damn screen. When I look under the screen, she looks like Phyliss Diller …I swear!!! lol Just shook my head and sighed. Is what it is.\n\nGo to the \"Mom\" screen. They were trained since birth, kept small and branchy, and turned pretty short. They were fully ready, just grown the entire time under T5 HO lighting. If you know, keeps them squat, grows a bit slower than HID or MH . Check on the Mom Cloudwatcher thingy…F ME!!! lol. Thing is gnarly looking, barely above the screen(8 inch's off buckets) with the largest buds on the screen. Just at or a touch over 30 days in, still under the T5's, covered in resin and when I touched her, I had to come downstairs and wash my hands because I could not operate the camera lens with glue on my fingers. She STINKS to high heaven's of StarDog. I have smoked Randy's StarDog before, and she dont play. Extremely potent bud, and a recognizable smell to her. This plant has that stink. So, i guess the POS on the big screen is staying, and I just have to deal with the fact she will have maybe 5 cola sites, while the Goji has 100. Going to be ugly watching her for next 10 weeks or so, but as a typical stoner…I make mistakes\n\nMy new young uns, Sugar Punch X Goji OG , are doing well. Destined to a small screen and trained for such. From seed, not showing sex as of 2 days ago, this one would make a nice female specimen. Pheno hunting, or rather just hunting, as no one has ever made this cross to my knowledge before, they will be going into the Mom screen when that screen finishes.\n\nThe more I grow the harder it is to FIND anything on my computer. I have 4.6 terabytes of storage filled 80 percent.\nI will stumble across one of the \"many\" and post it when I do.\n\nI had no work in the making of it…cannot take any credit for that, and it is still not stable. Or maybe it is. 50% of the plants grown from the seeds were \"average\" at best…the other 50% were stellar, and the 2 plants could be told apart pretty early.\nThats all there is, the flat tasting half ass ones, and then the delicious \"Many\" with great high too.\n\nI still have few of the seeds, maybe 5 or so, and once I get past this run and the next one, I will find the \"many\" again and keep a Mom. I did not this last run of her because I didn't think I liked it as much as I actually do. Mow that I am about out of it, I realize I should grow here every time. I like SWEET tastes in weed, with QUICK HIGH's…she has both.\n\nBoudica (aka Warrior Princess) is a mostly sativa variety from Eskobar Seeds and can be cultivated indoors (where the plants will need a flowering time of ±60 days) and outdoors. Eskobar Seeds' Boudica is/was never available as feminized seeds.\nEskobar Seeds' Boudica Description\n\nLogo Eskobar Seeds Eskobar Seeds Boudica The final stage of this 3 way hybrid project Exodus Cheese/Santa Maria Planck/C99. Easy to grow and very forgiving. The flowers get volume fast and become very dense. The taste is a mixture of pineapple/grapefruit and a little lemon. Testers described it to me as blood orange chewing gum. This is not the strongest one i have but she gives a smooth spiritual daydream. The plants grow like a skunk but with a little sativa stretch.\n\nA perfect combo between 3 top notch strains, 18 months of work to be proud of.\n\nShe makes beautiful colored Buds, strong smoke, fantastic taste.\nThe Santa Maria Planck plant used in this 3 way cross is to die for. Can feel n taste her in this cross.\n\nANYONE have a cut of this \"Santa Maria Planck\" …would trade anything I have for one…\n\nYou will probably not see me run any \"boutique\" strains, or run strains from the newer breeders. I am NOT a big fan of the \"Flavor of the Week\" breeders. I am 65, so my \"hero's\" are so old most here may not even know of them. Hell, half of them no longer are in the game, but I STILL run their genetics.\nI also LOVE to trade, and to be real honest, I would just as soon receive seeds from a QUALITY grower here, or on other sites I post at.\nExample: I would MUCH rather run Paintedfire420's cross of C99 x Guava Hashplant than Genetically Modified Miracle Alien PeanutButter Wedding Cookie Breath #4!!! At that's a fact!!!\n\nIf I am buying seeds, it is from folks like Sannie, Escobar(now gone) , Professor P, and Bodhi. Bodhi is my exception with the younger new breeders, he actually has a clue, and I like his cross's, he has a knack for picking good ones.\n\nBecause I KNOW MY TASTE'S, I need not go hunting too far from home. I have a PASSION for Goji OG, Chucky's Bride, certain CCK pheno's, and a particular c99 . I am going to spend my next several runs exploring what I have of them, because I know what comes out will be to MY LIKING! I am also going to run a few \"members\" seeds from here, a few have caught my eye, like the 1 mentioned above. I also have my eye's on some Orange Goji, and some Goji X Candyland.\n\nLEAF: Thanks for the welcome, appreciate it. We ALL still learn, been doing this since the 70's, I STILL have so much to learn. I am as successful as I am because i tend to KISS. Keep it simple stupid…something I suggest. Good clean soil or hydro, same conditions for each grow, and LISTEN TO THE PLANTS. Do those 3 things, your on your way!!\n\nWell, thought I had done my last \"tuck\" , but I was wrong. LAST TUCK just done, no more, screen is full. Going to let them run under the screen till Sunday afternoon, then bring them up through, turn them loose. Should be interesting, I have never taken my Goji cross this big before, so learn as we go. I am sick of jacking with the screen(not really, lol) and it will be nice to finally just let them GO do their thing.\nDid not tuck Chucky, nor POS, hoping they decide to come to Goji's party , if not I will let Goji run over them if they need the space.\n\nThe ladies are sucking a gallon a day each, so still not in full swing yet. Once the stretch is over, and they start making buds, the drinking will double in just 3-4 days time. By week 5 or 6, they will suck 3-4 gallons each per day. I can tell when they are about to finish by how much water they take. Right before they are done, water consumption will spike, then a week later, it slows WAY DOWN. When they come back to 1 gallon per day or so each, I start looking at trich's…usually they are all cloudy, with no amber at that time. I pull at 20 % amber…but several of my strains NEVER amber, and one of them is in this big screen, so I will watch close when it nears the end…\n\nThat was a very detailed and informative post…I have grown for 25 years, and still struggle with breeding information etc… Seems you run a tight ship. I am guessing you have put some serious time in, and if you are from Texas, you have Texas sized balls, to have learned so much while living there.\n\nI was fortunate enough to grow up in a growing friendly place. Keep up the good fight, sir.\n\nYou got that right. 25 years ago, MAN our heads were DOWN and TUCKED. NOT the same anymore.\n\nI am 65 have grey hair, do not look like a typical stoner…in fact I can walk down a street smoking a joint, NO ONE even looks AT ME!!! LMAO!!! I NO LONGER fear the FUZZ, lol. NO WAY IN HELL a trooper is TAKING ME IN over a joint. Smart enough to never have too much on me, and with age comes wisdom…i KNOW where and when I CAN…I KNOW where and when I cannot!!! The law has better things to do than fuck with a senior citizen …the one time I was hassled, I looked him in the eye(he was 30 years younger than me) and just said REALLY REALLY??? He cracked up, said get out of here…i said when I finish my \"cig\" ,he left, lol.\n\nMost of my acquired knowledge comes from other growers, Most over seas, in legal areas, or area's they can do it openly. I picked their brains for a decade, used their knowledge, and learned the plant. It pretty much boils down to learning to read the plant, they will tell you everything you need to know.\n\nLEAF: If your a beginner, or having \"trouble\" with your grows, an Octopot would change your life. IF you set it up with quality soil, and use TVF/TTF(food I use and 180% recommend) you just can not fail. Most new growers fail in 2 area's, watering correctly, and the set up environment. This will auto correct both of those for you.\nBuy an Octopot, pm me for how to build the soil(super simple 4 part 100% organic mix) , and for the nutes to use, and i will send you some seeds…same Goji that is on my screen. IF YOU DO NOT LOVE the whole setup, pm me again, I will reimburse you for the cost of the Octopot(50-70 bucks) . I made this offer to 5 people already…all 5 are now on their 2nd or 3rd run, and never going back to anything else.\nFor an \"expert\" they offer no real gains, maybe some yield gains(bottom feed plants almost always grow bigger) and ease of use, but for newbs or people W/ O a green thumb, you cannot beat them\n\nThese 4 ladies in my big screen will drink 12-18 gallons per day when fully getting it on. I fill the rez's from a 30 gallon bucket, with a pump and long handled shut off valve. The total time it takes is 5 minutes. NO CRAZY nute schedules, no soil issues, top 4 inches of the sleeve are totally DRY…so no pests either.\n\nSorry…not a % owner of Octopot's, lol., just a true believer in them, and they have allowed me to take my game to a new level. Before these, I ran hydroponic. G.H. Water Farm setups. Full on set up, rez, controller, tubes EVERYWHERE!!! 3 part nutes, FUCKED UP schedule changing every week. Leaky buckets, PH getting out of wack, PPM too high, too low, 100 issues . Produced VERY well however, and I ran them 10 years, had 60 buckets and all the gear…ONE RUN with ONE Octopot…threw it all out…", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "47b30f93-86a4-418d-9fd4-91c3f5b6b78c", "url": "https://overgrow.com/t/jetdros-1st-run-here-at-the-new-overgrow/19711"}

{"text": "Tag: disney world That\n\nDid I give it away? I have stayed at every single Walt Disney World Value Resort a few times, and my answer here is pretty easy: Disney's Art of Animation Resort. In fact, the contest really isn't even close.\n\nOpened during 2012, Disney's Art of Animation is Disney World's newest \"resort\" (technically, there have been a few Disney Vacation Club Resorts open since then). The resort was originally planned to be the second half of Pop Century, but only the main building and a few buildings were started before construction was halted due to a slow down at Disney. When the time came, Disney decided it needed a brand new resort, mostly because they finally figured out people would rather stay somewhere that is themed after their fantastic animated movies rather than giant rubik's cubes and bowling alleys.\n\nDisney's Art of Animation features 864 Little Mermaid themed \"standard\" rooms and 1,120 family suites, with either Lion King, Finding Nemo or Cars themes. The standard rooms are identical in size and layout to the rooms at Pop Century, since these were completed in the existing buildings that were abandoned earlier. The family suites are brand new, and not really available anywhere on property.\n\nWhat about the other Value Resorts?\n\nI don't really have a problem with the other value resorts, but they just aren't as good as Art of Animation. The All-Star Sports, All-Star Movies and All-Star Music resort suffer from a few setbacks that are just too much for me to overcome. They tend to the be home base for any youth dance, cheer or sports teams staying at Disney. This severely skews the adult to child ratio, and leads to a less enjoyable experience. Also, these three resorts are built next to each other, and most times, the three resorts share one bus, so if you happen to be near the end of the line, there are times the bus will not even stop due to capacity. If your family really wants to stay at the resorts (especially Movies), you will have a blast.\n\nPop Century was for quite a while my default value resort, and while there isn't really any downsides there like at the All-Stars, Art of Animation is just much, much better. I am still very happy to stay at Pop Century, it just isn't my first choice.\n\nThe Big Blue Pool\n\nWhat makes Art of Animation Special?\n\nLittle Mermaid rooms – Who has a little girl that doesn't love the Little Mermaid? Think about it, these are the only rooms on Disney property themed after a Disney princess. All-Star Movies has sections themed after The Mighty Ducks and Herbie the Love Bug. How many kids even know who The Mighty Ducks are? The Little Mermaid rooms are super cute, and really well done. There is even a Little Mermaid themed pool for your little mermaids to enjoy.\n\nFamily Suites – These family suites were probably the most requested room option at Walt Disney World for 20+ years. If you were on a budget, and had a family of 5+, you were extremely limited at Disney. There were the cabins at Fort Wilderness, but those don't really suit some people. Some of the rooms at Port Orleans – Riverside could sleep 5 with the use of a trundle bed, or you could get 2 connecting rooms at a value resort. None of the options were optimal, but the family suites are fantastic. They feature a \"master bedroom\" with its own bathroom, a front room with a fold down table/bed combo as well as a pull out couch and another bathroom. These work great for a family with kids, and who doesn't love Cars, Lion King or Finding Nemo?\n\nLandscapes of Flavor – This is Art of Animation's food court, and it is head and shoulders above the other food courts in terms of offerings and food. You can find a pretty decent meal here.\n\nThe Big Blue Pool – My favorite Value resort pool by far. Located in the Finding Nemo section of the resort, this pool is just beautiful, and surrounded by great Nemo decorations and oversized characters. Did you know this pool is the largest pool at Disney World outside of the water parks?\n\nCars Family Suite\n\nWhat are the downsides of Art of Animation?\n\nNot every Disney resort is perfect, and the Art of Animation has a few drawbacks:\n\nNo discounts – Ever since the Little Mermaid rooms opened in 2012, they have been excluded from every single Disney discount that has been released. If you want to stay there, you are going to pay the full rate. Sometimes during the years, like over Christmas, that really doesn't matter since nothing is discounted, but most of the year, you pay a decent premium to stay in these rooms. The Family suite are usually included in all discounts.\n\nValue resort – This is after all, still a value resort. So, you aren't near a theme park, the pools don't have slides or other amenities, there is just a food court, not a nicer restaurant, and the room quality isn't as nice as the moderate or deluxe resorts. That said, I think I would rather stay in an Art of Animation family suite that most of the moderate resorts, if the price is close.\n\nWhen planning your Disney World vacation, there are some dates you will want to figure out well in advance, and keep track of them. Now, while some of these are not super important, some definitely are. While you may think it is crazy to plan a breakfast 6 months in advance, EVERYONE does it, and there are only so many seats at the table, so don't dillydally. Your little princess may not be so princess like when she finds out you have to eat day old donuts for breakfast instead of eating with her favorite Disney characters.\n\nImportant dates when planning a Disney World vacation\n\n499 Days – This is the furthest away you can book your resort reservation, assuming rates and packages have been released for your dates. There are times during the year when you may be inside 499 days, but you can't book your vacation yet. If you are just booking a Walt Disney World Resort room, then you can book them 499 days in advance.\n\n365 Days – This is when you can rent a golf cart at Fort Wilderness. They sell out.\n\n180 Days – Probably the most important date, this is when you can book your dining reservations. If you are staying in a Disney World Resort, you can book all of your reservations for your entire stay 180 days before you check in, if you are staying off-site, you can only book reservations 180 days from the day of the reservation. 180 days in advance is also typically when you can make reservations for specialty cruises, tee-times for the Disney golf courses, boat rentals, etc.\n\n60 Days – Fast Pass Plus! You can now make your Fast Pass reservation online or on your mobile device with the use of the My Disney Experience app. Currently, you are allowed three Fast Passes per day that you can book in advance, and once those three are use, you can get another one at any fast pass kiosk in your park. Guests staying onsite, as long as you have a park pass linked to your My Disney Experience account, can make reservations for their entire stay 60 days in advance of check in. If you have an annual pass or just a normal Disney park pass, these reservations can be done 30 days in advance.\n\n30 Days – At this point, if you have a Disney World package that includes your Disney Resort and park passes, your balance will be due for your trip. If you just have a room only reservation, your balance will be due at check-in. You should at this point also have your Magic Bands customized online as they will ship to you as soon as your balance is paid, and if you are taking advantage of the Magical Express airport transportation, that should be set up by now as well to give Disney time to get the necessary documents to you.\n\n10 Days – By this point, you should have received your Magic Bands, Magical Express documents and Disney travel documents, and should be set to go.\n\nHave a great trip! Feel free to use the quick date calculator below to figure out your important dates:", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "9980271c-a4cb-4824-a59e-14fc464f8b04", "url": "https://www.disdom.com/tag/disney-world/page/26/"}

Log in to rate.\n\nI am thrilled to announce that the Guild has successfully recruited three new External Trustees to our Guild Board of Trustees! The role of externals on the board is to provide external oversight and expertise as we work to develop strategic direction and address issues at an organisational level. I am certain that Julie, Margaret and Natalie will be invaluable to the Board as the Guild continues to consider its long-term future and the sort of students' union it wants to be.\n\nSo, who are our new trustees?\n\nJulie Walkling: Julie has spent much of her life working on the strategic development of student support in universities as varied as Angela Ruskin and the Royal Agricultural University, and spent many of her early years volunteering for charities such as the London Lesbian & Gay Switchboard. We considered her expertise in Governance and developing strategic approaches to student support will be invaluable to the direction of Board, and by extension the Guild.\n\nMargaret Laithwaite: Margaret has recently retired her role as Deputy Finance Director at the University of Exeter but took the decision to apply to become a trustee of the Guild due to her love for students and commitment to improving student experience. Her exceptional expertise in the finance of higher education organisations and institutions will ensure constructive oversight and support for the finance directorate.\n\nNatalie Stewart: Natalie is an Exeter graduate who fondly remembers her time as a student at Exeter; particularly her involvement with the extra-curricular activities supported by the Guild. Her professional specialism in finance law, and experience running her own foodbank charity in London, made Natalie a standout candidate during the recruitment process.\n\nHowever, our successful recruitment means that we're saying goodbye to Keith, William and Andrew who will sadly be leaving the board at the end of June. Keith has devoted eight years to the Guild as an external on our board, and William and Andrew have both dedicated three years respectively. Their expertise and oversight, particularly in areas around finance and governance, has been crucial to ensuring the Guild remains active and committed to co-creating the best student experience for the student community at Exeter.", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "ea6e965f-9bf6-4242-94c5-3d2035cbf549", "url": "https://www.exeterguild.org/news/article/6001/Introducing-New-Guild-External-Trustees/"}

{"text": "I did not sleep well last night. It was too hot, too humid and I had some nightmares. My mood was not good at all … until I opened the curtain and the window: I spotted how the sky was colorfully changing.\n\nInstantly, I grabbed my breakfast from the kitchen, rushed to my roof top, find a comfortable position! And watched the lovely start of a sunrise at 5:26 am, accompanied with happily singing birds and a mild refreshing breeze of wind. The \"show\" can start!\n\nI ♥ the pastel colors, I ♥ how the sun-rays break through the clouds, I ♥ how the clouds are dancing with the sunrays!\n\nWait… Do you also see that? The the longer I watched it, the more I witnessed (in my mind): The moment when the dog says \"Good morning!\" to the dragon.\nWhat a wonderful moment! Good morning dog! Good morning dragon! Good morning myself!\n\nThis time (on last Sunday) I was watching the sunset from a crowded place, a bridge above a highway full of cars and busses. People were passing by quickly, some of them probably rushing home for dinner after work, or some of them rushing home as the temperature dropped down to 12 degrees, which was quite cold compared to the usual weather condition of HKG. The pedestrian bridge was vibrating whenever a bus or truck passed by. It was indeed not a place of \"peace\". Nevertheless I chose this place to watch the moment of the sun saying good night to the whole world.\nI was standing in the middle of the crowd, leaning at the grey cold rail. Actually the color had already started to peel off. Today's sunset should be at 5:39pm. Before I came I checked schedule on the internet. Nobody cared about me. I watched at my clock on my mobile phone. I looked up. In front of me was nothing special except the highway and a construction area far away from me. In few minutes the sun would go down. I waited with a huge smile. I felt excited and happy at the same time.\nAt the beginning the sun light was dazzling me. Then bit by bit the color of the sky started to change from blue to yellow, orange and red. It was just few minutes, but I felt like watching the sunset for a longer time. I love this moment of the sun. It is so easing! Today it was special just because I used to enjoy the sunset from a nicer venue like sea or special designed viewpoint. But today I was standing on a simple bridge.\nFinally the sun was hidden behind the construction area, and the city has been left in darkness. I was going to leave the area.. and I was surprised. Just next to me, there were an old local couple taking photos of the sunset and them. They hold their hands and smiled at me. And then I realized that there were more persons around me they stopped to watch the sunset. On my left hand side there was a student boy, taking photos of the sunset as well. He smiled at me and left the bridge. I smiled back to all of them. I had the feeling the sunset not only left darkness, but also a bit of happiness, because we have been all connected with the sun for few minutes.\nThank you and good night, dear sun!\nBut, hello Nobu!\nMy day had just started. I was heading to my next destination: a Christmas market.\n\nWhenever I am on holiday (e.g. Okinawa) I am eager to see the sunrise and the sunset, it is so amazingly beautiful!! None of the sunrise or sunset is the same, that's why it is interesting to look at them everyday. They gave me the feeling \"Ah~~, the day are going to start! I need to add oil!\" and \"Ah~, the day is going to end. It was a successful day.\" Every day's moments are different, same as my every-day-life.\nHonestly speaking, in HKG I have not been that eager to see the sunrise or sunset yet, because I think the environment (city only) is not that beautiful and most of the time I am just too busy doing overtime. Hm? Sounds like an excuse, might be.\nHowever, these days I am seeking for watching the sunset in HKG. The Gateway and the China Hong Kong City in TST offers to see \"Magic Moment\", between 6pm and 7pm, from their facilities. Last week I took the chance to enjoy those magic moments after work.\n\nWow, it is so beautiful. Indeed it is a different feeling (for me) to watch the sun going down and disappearing into the sea, cloud or behind the city. But still, it is gorgeous! Watching the sunset, I am able to calm down for a while and think about my day.\n\nHere is a sunset in Hung Hom at the Railway station. On the window indoor lights are reflecting, it looks like some UFOs are flying in the sky. Don't you think so?\n\nSince 4th of October I am back in HKG from my long trip from Japan. I went to Okinawa and Tokyo. I am missing Okinawa's food, nature, simple life and music. I miss my new and old friends. I had indeed a nice and memoriable trip. I will blog some more details later on.\n\nDuring the trip, I have watched several sunsets. It is so beautiful. Looking at the sunset, I am aware of the end of day. Looking at the sun going down within several minutes, I am reviewing my activities on that day. Finally I also say good night to the sun.\n\nEven though I am in HKG, I like to watch the sunset in Okinawa, especially on Taketomi Island via webcam. I am remembering what I have experienced in Okinawa. This photo is taken from the webcamsite today.\n\nGood night Okinawa's sun.\nGood night Taketomi Island.\nGood night Memories in Japan.", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "806d6228-b6b9-42b3-b44d-d3ca6d7a7c41", "url": "http://www.animeplanet.de/nobu/?cat=99"}

For most of the first quarter Southlake dominated but the Eagles roared back at the end of the first half and never looked back. (Photo by Santos Salazar/DeSoto High School)\n\nEagle Standouts Battle For State Supremacy, December 17 at AT&T Stadium\n\nARLINGTON—DeSoto returns to AT&T Stadium to face Cibolo Steele Saturday, December 17 in the 6A-Division 2 State Championship game. After a comeback victory over the Klein Collins Tigers, the Eagles remain undefeated going into their first championship game.\n\nThe Eagles last faced Steele (14-1) during a September 2015 non-district game when they fell 35-32. Steele's highly powered offense and defense was able to gain and hold an early lead over DeSoto.\n\nStarting the second half down by 15 points at 28-13, DeSoto rallied to overcome the San Antonio powerhouse in the remaining minutes. Then Quarterback Tristan Wallace led his squad to the red zone on three separate occasions, connecting on one occasion with now Senior WR Laviska Shenault.\n\nThe Eagles offense was stunted in the remaining four minutes by Steele's defense and their own penalties.\n\nA number of things have changed since the Eagles last met the Knights. The offense has an active and mature quarterback. The receiving corps has been expanded, and the DeSoto defense is on fire. As a matter of fact, the last two post season matches have been decided by the defense.\n\nShawn Robinson scores from 20 yards out to make the game score 23 to 10 in the Eagles favor against the Cedar Hill Longhorns on September 23, 2016.\n\nShawn Robinson, QB\n\nYou cannot begin any top player list without Shawn Robinson at the top. The 6'1″/217-pound quarterback has a strong arm and is not afraid to execute the option. In 15 appearances he has logged 4,463 yards (3,191 passing/1,272 rushing). He's accurate too. The TCU commit has only 8 interceptions and 3 fumbles the entire season.\n\nSave\n\nKelan Walker\n\nKelan Walker, RB\n\nOnly a Junior and DeSoto Eagles Running Back Kelan Walker is boasting the highest rushing yards among the receiving corps. Walker averages 7.2 yards per carry, totaling 809 yards.\n\nRichie Washington Jr, RB\n\nWashington is just short of Walker with 743 rushing yards and 11 touchdowns. In the comeback win over Klein Collins, he scored twice and ran for 70 yards.\n\nSave\n\nWide Receivers Laviska Shenault and K.D. Nixon\n\nKadarrion (K.D.) Nixon, WR\n\nYou can't talk about offensive power without Eagles' wide receiver KD Nixon, Robinson's right hand man. During the first drive of each game, without fail Robinson attempts to connect with Nixon for an early score. No other wide out's stats comes close to Nixon. To date he has 1,100 receiving yards. The potent ball carrier has become a target for opposing defenses. Head Coach Todd Peterman has had to put him in the running back slot to avoid double teaming.\n\n\"He's always a target. So we are moving him around a little bit more to other positions. And we continue to get him the ball,\" Peterman explained\n\nLaviska Shenault, WR\n\nShenault is the only Senior member of the offense that scored against Cibolo Steele during the last season. Shenault comes second to Nixon in receiving yards but exceeds his teammate in the 18 average yards per catch.\n\nSave\n\nAfter Southlake scored early in the first half, the Eagle defense rose to the occasion forcing thee Dragons to kick from their own three yard line. It was all downhill from there as defensive players like Phillip Jones tackling the Southlake quarterback. (Photo by Marifer Vega/DeSoto High School)\n\nThe Entire DeSoto Eagles Defense\n\nAs explosive as the Eagles defense has been as of late, it is difficult to pick only a handful of luminaries.

It also won first place for enterprise systems in the INNovators Awards, a designation intended to advance the spread of business technology acumen in the insurance industry.\n\nBoth awards stem from its widespread use of technology that resulted in business benefits, including:\n\nOne standard, intuitive user interface across the enterprise regardless of the underlying system or technology platform.\n\nWith SmartBPM technology, Farmers revamped its CRM initiatives and FNOL application, known as HERO, which presents context-aware information to guide customers in filing auto claims. HERO, implemented early last year, triggers the right questions, gathers the right answers and integrates into the claim system itself so that all information becomes part of the case file. The success of the initial project spawned other units of the Farmers family of companies to quickly implement similar programs.\n\nIn their 17th year, the annual Global Excellence Awards in BPM and Workflow awards recognize organizations, such as Farmers, which have implemented innovative solutions that meet strategic business objectives. They are sponsored jointly by BPM.com and Workflow Management Coalition (WfMC).\n\nIn their fourth year, the INNovators Awards are given to insurance organizations that have led or contributed to a business application or project that uses innovation to successfully drive business impact, technical impact or the innovation itself.

{"text": "Why I am getting tired of justifying why I don't have grey hair!\n\nWhen I set up Fab after Fifty over 11 years ago, is was to provide resources for women to live their best possible lives over 50. At the time there was very little out there that supported getting older in a positive way. Mainstream media was so far behind in how they presented midlife women – whenever I had a meeting the only over 50 celebrities mentioned were Helen Mirren and Judi Dench – both fabulous but both considerably over 50. In fact Judi Dench is older than my mother. Perceptions were lagging behind reality. I was on a mission to change that. This was at a time when there was no Instagram and midlifers were yet to adopt facebook as their platform of choice.\n\nPositive messages about life and work over 50\n\nI poured everything into getting positive messages about ageing and working over 50 in particular out into the world.\n\nFast forward 11 years and I have to be honest. I have become disillusioned. It seems that all that I have done is being overshadowed by the fact that I don't have grey hair. I am often asked why I don't post many photos of myself on the site or my various social media profiles. There are a number of reasons for this . Firstly I have never liked having my photograph taken – even as a child. Secondly, Fab after Fifty was never supposed to be about me. I created it to provide resources and also to highlight real women who are reinventing their lives and living life to the full. The third reason has only recently come into play. When I post photos of myself I am criticised for not embracing my age – for not practicing what I am encouraging other women to do. The reason being that I do not have grey hair. It seems that I letting down the sisterhood by not showcasing my silver tresses.\n\nSome women do have naturally grey hair and choose to colour it. That is absolutely their choice – just as it is a choice to let your hair go grey naturally. I think its a great step forward that women do not feel pressured to cover the grey to feel good about themselves. Equally those who choose to continue to dye their hair should not be criticised for doing so. And for those of us who go grey later than others (some don't go grey at all) we should not be judged based on the colour of our hair.\n\nAs it happens, my hair is not grey. It has become darker as I have got older – but it hasn't gone grey. I have a few blonde highlights added every few months or so ( mostly as it helps with the texture) , but I have no grey to cover. Even during lockdown when my blonde highlights grew out no grey appeared. My grandmother didn't go grey. At the very end of her life following surgery she developed one white streak through her hair – but the remainder stayed dark. My mother started going grey in her late thirties – she took after her silver haired father- my sister has embraced her grey. So far I have no grey.\n\nI think the problem with hair is that the visual impact on seeing someone is immediate. Some may choose to go grey to 'embrace their age' yet still choose to have botox, fillers or even cosmetic surgery. Absolutely their choice but far less obvious and so any criticism from the 'embrace your age' judges is held back\n\nI am tired of constantly apologising for this fact and having it overshadow all the work I have over the past 11 years. So much so that I was seriously thinking of walking away from the website and the Fab after Fifty project. I feel I'm damned if I do and damned if I don't. If I don't post pictures of me then I am criticised for not showing the person behind the brand, but when I do post images I am criticised for not embracing my age. Either way I can't win. Why are women of our age so judgemental?", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "97b5ff6e-47d6-47a2-8ea5-75d6643f64bf", "url": "https://www.fabafterfifty.co.uk/2020/10/23/why-i-am-getting-tired-of-justifying-why-i-dont-have-grey-hair/"}

How can I have a feedback on your customers' satisfaction ?\n\nDo you publish a newsletter ?\n\nNo we don't for the moment.\n\nOur main vector of communication is Instagram where we often publish our news, novelties and other information. We encourage you to follow our Instagram account. If you don't have Instagram, you can create an account and follow accounts you wish without publishing and being seen (\"private account\").\n\n- the second one is a pocket spring bar tool, a really nice object you can bring everywhere, you can use it at home as well.\n\nOnce the strap removed, check the condition of your spring bars and put them back of the watch to get this. Then you will put any 1 piece strap on the watch without any tool and in record time ! Demonstration here.\n\n———— ♦ ————\n\nMy watch has an odd lug width (19 mm, 21 mm, ...), do you have any straps of this width ?\n\nYes we propose a large choice of leather watch straps of 19 and 21 mm lug widths in 2 pieces SELECT-HEURE collection.\n\nFor 1 piece, few odd width straps exist because odd lug width watches are not common.\n\nDo not forget to check that the strap is compliant with your watch (shape, width, thickness, colors, style, ...).\n\nFor connected watches, 1 piece strap is not the best option as it doesn't allow the use of capters under the watch. Unless you don't want to use them.\n\nIf you look for specific color(s), think to use the filters or the research tool proposed here above. The offer is large, you will then be sure to see all the straps containing this (these) colors.\n\nPlease note that it is not necessary to choose colors from your watch, we have seen beautiful matches without color in common.\n\nTime to make your choice, be inventive and creative !\n\n———— ♦ ————\n\nDo I have to change the spring bars of my watch if I put a 1 piece strap ?\n\nThe forces applied on the spring bars are bigger with a 1 piece strap than with traditional ones. Therefore, it is important to check the good state and quality of the spring bars.\n\nIf it is not the case, we propose perfectly adapted springs bars. If you want the best in terms of sturdiness, choose the \"special strong\" ones. The quality of the others are good too. All of them are Swiss made.\n\n———— ♦ ————\n\nI want to change the spring bars of my watch, which one should I choose ?\n\nThe crucial point : does your watch have drilled horns (full crossing drilling in the whole width of the horns), or undrilled horns (drilling only in the inside part of the horns, not in the whole width) ?\n\nCaution : If you put regular spring bars on an undrilled horns watch, you will not be able to remove the watch band without damaging it. Regular spring bars do not have the flanges that enable the fork of the tool to compress the spring. Therefore, you will have to use a tool such as cutting pliers to cut the straps, with the risk of damaging the watch too.\n\nAll spring bars sold here are adapted to the straps we sell. They are high quality swiss made products. If you want the best in terms of sturdiness, choose the \"special strong\" spring bars.\n\n———— ♦ ————\n\nDo you deliver in my country ?\n\nWe deliver Worldwide.\n\nAll proposed delivery modes are reliable : not need to worry about the shipment distance.\n\nIf I order several straps, will I have a discount ?\n\nYes we propose a volume discount on a selection of products. This discount is not automatic, you have to enter a promotion code while validating your order. No need to create an account to know the exact amount of the discount. Details here.\n\n———— ♦ ————\n\nWhat are the shipping (delivery) costs ?\n\nShipment outside of France starts from 4,90 € (bubble pack sent as a standard letter worldwide without tracking number).\n\nImportant : \"Lettre Internationale sans no de suivi (without tracking number)\" is cheap but is not registered. We recommend delivery modes with tracking numbers, more expensive, but more reliable and secure.\n\n———— ♦ ————\n\nIf I order today, when will I receive the products ?\n\nOur commitment : parcels are dispatched no later than the working day after receiving your payment (very fast shipments).\n\nMost of the time, orders placed before 11H AM are shipped the same day.\n\nOnce the parcel is shipped, the delivery time depends on the postal services, therefore we cannot commit on it.\n\n———— ♦ ————\n\nI placed an order.

{"text": "Recently my friend Sarah Sumerlin and I were driving down the back roads between Washington and Oregon snapping pictures. Sarah's a brilliant photographer and I love to take pictures to remind myself of stories I want to share. It was a perfect time of the day, and we were finding all kinds of things that \"spoke\" to us. Then out of nowhere, there it was…a sign!\n\nI have looked into \"the raw diet\" for awhile now. Well, actually since 1994, when I was recovering after being diagnosed with lupus. Back then, a friend had introduced me to \"blue-green\" algae and its health benefits. She also introduced me to some really amazing people in the world of holistic health, which up to that point I had never even heard of. I was a very typical American who ate the Standard American Diet (known in the holistic world as SAD), never considering that what I ate and becoming ill had any link whatsoever.\n\nI just do! I love driving with the radio blaring, windows rolled down, feeling like there isn't a care in the world. I am the \"best me\" in the summer. Although I don't particularly like the heat, I love the rhythm of summer…the backyard barbecues with friends, the farmer's market, and spending time\n\nWhether it is vintage clothing, trailers, or albums, it seems that \"everything old is new again.\" Recently my oldest son, who is currently serving in Afghanistan, sent my husband a push mower. Not the motored kind, but a rotating-blade push mower. It was the perfect Father's Day gift, one that showed both the practical side of my Marine and the comedic side. You see, my hubby has never had much success with lawn mowers, and it has become a sort of joke in our family. I am convinced that every mower that my husband has purchased in our 25-year marriage must have been built on a Friday.\n\nThere is something magical about summer. It seems that there is a mystical rhythm to it that presents itself in the slight breeze, reminding me of those carefree days of childhood. I never desire to go back in time until these moments. But the gentle wind makes me miss the innocence of looking into the garden without knowing how much work they actually are.\n\nI love that little mantra, although I wasted much of my life up to this point not living it. Some of my favorite people and personalities are those who seem to do just that: Dance like no one is watching. I find that I am drawn to those people the most, although oftentimes I don't jump into the dance, but sit on the sidelines and admire them dancing.\n\nHave you ever had the experience of awakening and just for a moment lying there and thinking of all the reasons you are grateful?\n\nA while back, maybe a year or more now, I decided I was done focusing on all the things that were \"wrong\" in my life, and that I would greet each day by giving thanks for all the things that were \"right~ Mark Twain\n\nDebbie Bosworth\n\nis a certified farmgirl at heart.

{"text": "Amends Model Rules 1.18 and 7.3, and 7.1, 7.2 and 5.5\n\nRESOLVED, That the _ amends the ABA Model Rules of Professional Conduct dated August 2012, to provide guidance regarding lawyers' use of technology and client development as follows (insertions underlined, deletions struck through):\n\n(a) A person who discussesconsults with a lawyer about the possibility of forming a client-lawyer relationship with respect to a matter is a prospective client.\n\n(b) Even when no client-lawyer relationship ensues, a lawyer who has had discussions withlearned information from a prospective client shall not use or reveal that information learned in the consultation, except as Rule 1.9 would permit with respect to information of a former client.\n\n(c) A lawyer subject to paragraph (b) shall not represent a client with interests materially adverse to those of a prospective client in the same or a substantially related matter if the lawyer received information from the prospective client that could be significantly harmful to that person in the matter, except as provided in paragraph (d). If a lawyer is disqualified from representation under this paragraph, no lawyer in a firm with which that lawyer is associated may knowingly undertake or continue representation in such a matter, except as provided in paragraph (d).\n\n(d) When the lawyer has received disqualifying information as defined in paragraph (c), representation is permissible if:\n\n(1) both the affected client and the prospective client have given informed consent, confirmed in writing, or:\n\n(2) the lawyer who received the information took reasonable measures to avoid exposure to more disqualifying information than was reasonably necessary to determine whether to represent the prospective client; and\n\n(i) the disqualified lawyer is timely screened from any participation in the matter and is apportioned no part of the fee therefrom; and\n\n(ii) written notice is promptly given to the prospective client.\n\nComment\n\n[1] Prospective clients, like clients, may disclose information to a lawyer, place documents or other property in the lawyer's custody, or rely on the lawyer's advice. A lawyer's discussionsconsultations with a prospective client usually are limited in time and depth and leave both the prospective client and the lawyer free (and sometimes required) to proceed no further. Hence, prospective clients should receive some but not all of the protection afforded clients.\n\n[2] Not all persons who communicate information to a lawyer are entitled to protection under this Rule.A person becomes a prospective client by consulting with a lawyer about the possibility of forming a client-lawyer relationship with respect to a matter. Whether communications, including written, oral, or electronic communications, constitute a consultation depends on the circumstances. For example, a consultation is likely to have occurred if a lawyer, either in person or through the lawyer's advertising in any medium, specifically requests or invites the submission of information about a potential representation without clear and reasonably understandable warnings and cautionary statements that limit the lawyer's obligations, and a person provides information in response. See also Comment [4]. In contrast, a consultation does not occur if a person provides information to a lawyer in response to advertising that merely describes the lawyer's education, experience, areas of practice, and contact information, or provides legal information of general interest. Aperson who communicatesSuch a person communicates information unilaterally to a lawyer, without any reasonable expectation that the lawyer is willing to discuss the possibility of forming a client-lawyer relationship, and is thus not a \"prospective client.\" within the meaning of paragraph (a).Moreover, a person who communicates with a lawyer for the purpose of disqualifying the lawyer is not a \"prospective client.\"\n\n…\n\n[4] In order to avoid acquiring disqualifying information from a prospective client, a lawyer considering whether or not to undertake a new matter should limit the initial interviewthe initial consultationto only such information as reasonably appears necessary for that purpose. Where the information indicates that a conflict of interest or other reason for non-representation exists, the lawyer should so inform the prospective client or decline the representation. If the prospective client wishes to retain the lawyer, and if consent is possible under Rule 1.7, then consent from all affected present or former clients must be obtained before accepting the representation.\n\n[5] A lawyer may condition conversationsa consultation with a prospective client on the\n\nperson's informed consent that no information disclosed during the consultation will prohibit the lawyer from representing a different client in the matter. See Rule 1.0(e) for the definition of informed consent. If the agreement expressly so provides, the prospective client may also consent to the lawyer's subsequent use of information received from the prospective client.\n\n…\n\nRule 7.1 Communications Concerning a Lawyer's Services\n\n.\n\nCOMMENT\n\n…\n\n[3] An advertisement that truthfully reports a lawyer's achievements on behalf of clients or former clients may be misleading if presented so as to lead a reasonable person to form an unjustified expectation that the same results could be obtained for other clients in similar matters without reference to the specific factual and legal circumstances of each client's case. Similarly, an unsubstantiated comparison of the lawyer's services or fees with the services or fees of other lawyers may be misleading if presented with such specificity as would lead a reasonable person to conclude that the comparison can be substantiated. The inclusion of an appropriate disclaimer or qualifying language may preclude a finding that a statement is likely to create unjustified expectations or otherwise mislead the public.a prospective client.\n\n…\n\nRule 7.2 Advertising\n\n(a) Subject to the requirements of Rules 7.1 and 7.3, a lawyer may advertise services through written, recorded or electronic communication, including public media.\n\n(b) A lawyer shall not give anything of value to a person for recommending the lawyer's services except that a lawyer may\n\n(1) pay the reasonable costs of advertisements or communications permitted by this Rule;\n\n(2) pay the usual charges of a legal services plan or a not-for-profit or qualified lawyer referral service. A qualified lawyer referral service is a lawyer referral service that has been approved by an appropriate regulatory authority;\n\n(3) pay for a law practice in accordance with Rule 1.17; and\n\n(4) refer clients to another lawyer or a nonlawyer professional pursuant to an agreement not otherwise prohibited under these Rules that provides for the other person to refer clients or customers to the lawyer, if\n\n(i) the reciprocal referral agreement is not exclusive, and\n\n(ii) the client is informed of the existence and nature of the agreement.\n\n(c) Any communication made pursuant to this Rule shall include the name and office address of at least one lawyer or law firm responsible for its content.\n\nComment\n\n[1] To assist the public in learning about and obtaining legal services, lawyers should be allowed to make known their services not only through reputation but also through organized information campaigns in the form of advertising. Advertising involves an active quest for clients, contrary to the tradition that a lawyer should not seek clientele. However, the public's need to know about legal services can be fulfilled in part through advertising. This need is particularly acute in the case of persons of moderate means who have not made extensive use of legal services. The interest in expanding public information about legal services ought to prevail over tradition. Nevertheless, advertising by lawyers entails the risk of practices that are misleading or overreaching.\n\n[2] This Rule permits public dissemination of information concerning a lawyer's name or firm name, address, email address, website, and telephone number; the kinds of services the lawyer will undertake; the basis on which the lawyer's fees are determined, including prices for specific services and payment and credit arrangements; a lawyer's foreign language ability; names of references and, with their consent, names of clients regularly represented; and other information that might invite the attention of those seeking legal assistance.\n\n[3] Questions of effectiveness and taste in advertising are matters of speculation and subjective judgment. Some jurisdictions have had extensive prohibitions against television and other forms of advertising, against advertising going beyond specified facts about a lawyer, or against \"undignified\" advertising. Television, the Internet, and other forms of electronic communication areis now one ofamong the most powerful media for getting information to the public, particularly persons of low and moderate income; prohibiting television, Internet, and other forms of electronic advertising, therefore, would impede the flow of information about legal services to many sectors of the public. Limiting the information that may be advertised has a similar effect and assumes that the bar can accurately forecast the kind of information that the public would regard as relevant. Similarly, electronic media, such as the Internet, can be an important source of information about legal services, and lawful communication by electronic mail is permitted by this Rule. But see Rule 7.3(a) for the prohibition against thea solicitation ofa prospective client through a real-time electronic exchange initiated by the lawyer.that is not initiated by the prospective client.\n\n…\n\nPaying Others to Recommend a Lawyer\n\n[5] Except as permitted under paragraphs (b)(1)-(b)(4), Llawyers are not permitted to pay others for channeling professional workrecommending the lawyer's services or for channeling professional work in a manner that violates Rule 7.3. A communication contains a recommendation if it endorses or vouches for a lawyer's credentials, abilities, competence, character, or other professional qualities. Paragraph (b)(1), however, allows a lawyer to pay for advertising and communications permitted by this Rule, including the costs of print directory listings, on-line directory listings, newspaper ads, television and radio airtime, domain-name registrations, sponsorship fees, banner ads,Internet-based advertisements, and group advertising. A lawyer may compensate employees, agents and vendors who are engaged to provide marketing or client development services, such as publicists, public-relations personnel, business-development staff and website designers. Moreover, a lawyer may pay others for generating client leads, such as Internet-based client leads, as long as the lead generator does not recommend the lawyer, any payment to the lead generator is consistent with Rules 1.5(e) (division of fees) and 5.4 (professional independence of the lawyer), and the lead generator's communications are consistent with Rule 7.1 (communications concerning a lawyer's services). To comply with Rule 7.1, a lawyer must not pay a lead generator that states, implies, or creates a reasonable impression that it is recommending the lawyer, is making the referral without payment from the lawyer, or has analyzed a person's legal problems when determining which lawyer should receive the referral. See also Rule 5.3 for the(duties of lawyers and law firms with respect to the conduct of nonlawyers); Rule 8.4(a) (duty to avoid violating the Rules through the acts of another). who prepare marketing materials for them.\n\n[6] A lawyer may pay the usual charges of a legal service plan or a not-for-profit or qualified lawyer referral service. A legal service plan is a prepaid or group legal service plan or a similar delivery system that assists people who seekprospective clients to secure legal representation. A lawyer referral service, on the other hand, is any organization that holds itself out to the public as a lawyer referral service. Such referral services are understood by laypersonsthe public to be consumer-oriented organizations that provide unbiased referrals to lawyers with appropriate experience in the subject matter of the representation and afford other client protections, such as complaint procedures or malpractice insurance requirements. Consequently, this Rule only permits a lawyer to pay the usual charges of a not-for-profit or qualified lawyer referral service. A qualified lawyer referral service is one that is approved by an appropriate regulatory authority as affording adequate protections for the public.prospective clients. See, e.g., the _'s Model Supreme Court Rules Governing Lawyer Referral Services and Model Lawyer Referral and Information Service Quality Assurance Act (requiring that organizations that are identified as lawyer referral services (i) permit the participation of all lawyers who are licensed and eligible to practice in the jurisdiction and who meet reasonable objective eligibility requirements as may be established by the referral service for the protection of the publicprospective clients; (ii) require each participating lawyer to carry reasonably adequate malpractice insurance; (iii) act reasonably to assess client satisfaction and address client complaints; and (iv) do not make referralsprospective clients to lawyers who own, operate or are employed by the referral service).\n\n[7] A lawyer who accepts assignments or referrals from a legal service plan or referrals from a lawyer referral service must act reasonably to assure that the activities of the plan or service are compatible with the lawyer's professional obligations. See Rule 5.3. Legal service plans and lawyer referral services may communicate with prospective clientsthe public, but such communication must be in conformity with these Rules. Thus, advertising must not be false or misleading, as would be the case if the communications of a group advertising program or a group legal services plan would mislead the publicprospective clients to think that it was a lawyer referral service sponsored by a state agency or bar association. Nor could the lawyer allow in-person, telephonic, or real-time contacts that would violate Rule 7.3.\n\n…\n\nRule 7.3 Direct Contact with ProspectiveSolicitation of Clients\n\n(a) A lawyer shall not by in-person, live telephone or real-time electronic contact, solicit professional employment from a prospective client when a significant motive for the lawyer's doing so is the lawyer's pecuniary gain, unless the person contacted:\n\n(1) is a lawyer; or\n\n(2) has a family, close personal, or prior professional relationship with the lawyer.\n\n(b) A lawyer shall not solicit professional employment from a prospective client by written, recorded or electronic communication or by in-person, telephone or real-time electronic contact even when not otherwise prohibited by paragraph (a), if:\n\n(1) the prospective clienttarget of the solicitation has made known to the lawyer a desire not to be solicited by the lawyer; or\n\n(2) the solicitation involves coercion, duress or harassment.\n\n(c) Every written, recorded or electronic communication from a lawyer soliciting professional employment from anyoneaprospective client known to be in need of legal services in a particular matter shall include the words \"Advertising Material\" on the outside envelope, if any, and at the beginning and ending of any recorded or electronic communication, unless the recipient of the communication is a person specified in paragraphs (a)(1) or (a)(2).\n\n(d) Notwithstanding the prohibitions in paragraph (a), a lawyer may participate with a prepaid or group legal service plan operated by an organization not owned or directed by the lawyer that uses in-person or telephone contact to solicit memberships or subscriptions for the plan from persons who are not known to need legal services in a particular matter covered by the plan.\n\nComment\n\n[1] A solicitation is a targeted communication initiated by the lawyer that is directed to a specific person and that offers to provide, or can reasonably be understood as offering to provide, legal services. In contrast, a lawyer's communication typically does not constitute a solicitation if it is directed to the general public, such as through a billboard, an Internet banner advertisement, a website or a television commercial, or if it is in response to a request for information or is automatically generated in response to Internet searches.\n\n[12] There is a potential for abuse when a solicitation involvesinherent in direct in-person, live telephone or real-time electronic contact by a lawyer with someonea prospective client known to need legal services. These forms of contact between a lawyer and a prospective client subject the laypersona person to the private importuning of the trained advocate in a direct interpersonal encounter. The personprospective client, who may already feel overwhelmed by the circumstances giving rise to the need for legal services, may find it difficult fully to evaluate all available alternatives with reasoned judgment and appropriate self-interest in the face of the lawyer's presence and insistence upon being retained immediately. The situation is fraught with the possibility of undue influence, intimidation, and over-reaching.\n\n[23] This potential for abuse inherent in direct in-person, live telephone or real-time electronic solicitation of prospective clients justifies its prohibition, particularly since lawyers haveadvertising and written and recorded communication permitted under Rule 7.2offer alternative means of conveying necessary information to those who may be in need of legal services. Advertising and written and recordedIn particular, communications,canwhich may bebe mailed or autodialedor transmitted by email or other electronic means that do not involve real-time contact and do not violate other laws governing solicitations. These forms of communications and solicitations make it possible for the publica prospectiveclient to be informed about the need for legal services, and about the qualifications of available lawyers and law firms, without subjecting the prospective clientthe public to direct in-person, telephone or real-time electronic persuasion that may overwhelm the client'sa person's judgment.\n\n[34] The use of general advertising and written, recorded or electronic communications to transmit information from lawyer to the publicprospective client, rather than direct in-person, live telephone or real-time electronic contact, will help to assure that the information flows cleanly as well as freely. The contents of advertisements and communications permitted under Rule 7.2 can be permanently recorded so that they cannot be disputed and may be shared with others who know the lawyer. This potential for informal review is itself likely to help guard against statements and claims that might constitute false and misleading communications, in violation of Rule 7.1. The contents of direct in-person, live telephone or real-time electronic conversations between a lawyer and a prospective clientcontact can be disputed and may not be subject to third-party scrutiny. Consequently, they are much more likely to approach (and occasionally cross) the dividing line between accurate representations and those that are false and misleading.\n\n[45] There is far less likelihood that a lawyer would engage in abusive practices against an individual who is a former client, or a person with whom the lawyer has close personal or family relationship, or in situations in which the lawyer is motivated by considerations other than the lawyer's pecuniary gain. Nor is there a serious potential for abuse when the person contacted is a lawyer. Consequently, the general prohibition in Rule 7.3(a) and the requirements of Rule 7.3(c) are not applicable in those situations. Also, paragraph (a) is not intended to prohibit a lawyer from participating in constitutionally protected activities of public or charitable legal-service organizations or bona fide political, social, civic, fraternal, employee or trade organizations whose purposes include providing or recommending legal services to itstheir members or beneficiaries.\n\n[56] But even permitted forms of solicitation can be abused. Thus, any solicitation which contains information which is false or misleading within the meaning of Rule 7.1, which involves coercion, duress or harassment within the meaning of Rule 7.3(b)(2), or which involves contact with a prospective clientsomeone who has made known to the lawyer a desire not to be solicited by the lawyer within the meaning of Rule 7.3(b)(1) is prohibited. Moreover, if after sending a letter or other communication to a client as permitted by Rule 7.2 the lawyer receives no response, any further effort to communicate with the recipient of the communicationprospective client may violate the provisions of Rule 7.3(b).\n\n[67] This Rule is not intended to prohibit a lawyer from contacting representatives of organizations or groups that may be interested in establishing a group or prepaid legal plan for their members, insureds, beneficiaries or other third parties for the purpose of informing such entities of the availability of and details concerning the plan or arrangement which the lawyer or lawyer's firm is willing to offer. This form of communication is not directed to people who are seeking legal services for themselves.aprospective client. Rather, it is usually addressed to an individual acting in a fiduciary capacity seeking a supplier of legal services for others who may, if they choose, become prospective clients of the lawyer. Under these circumstances, the activity which the lawyer undertakes in communicating with such representatives and the type of information transmitted to the individual are functionally similar to and serve the same purpose as advertising permitted under Rule 7.2.\n\n[78] The requirement in Rule 7.3(c) that certain communications be marked \"Advertising Material\" does not apply to communications sent in response to requests of potential clients or their spokespersons or sponsors. General announcements by lawyers, including changes in personnel or office location, do not constitute communications soliciting professional employment from a client known to be in need of legal services within the meaning of this Rule.\n\n[89] Paragraph (d) of this Rule permits a lawyer to participate with an organization which uses personal contact to solicit members for its group or prepaid legal service plan, provided that the personal contact is not undertaken by any lawyer who would be a provider of legal services through the plan. The organization must not be owned by or directed (whether as manager or otherwise) by any lawyer or law firm that participates in the plan. For example, paragraph (d) would not permit a lawyer to create an organization controlled directly or indirectly by the lawyer and use the organization for the in-person or telephone solicitation of legal employment of the lawyer through memberships in the plan or otherwise. The communication permitted by these organizations also must not be directed to a person known to need legal services in a particular matter, but is to be designed to inform potential plan members generally of another means of affordable legal services. Lawyers who participate in a legal service plan must reasonably assure that the plan sponsors are in compliance with Rules 7.1, 7.2 and 7.3(b). See 8.4(a). the public or otherwise represent that to provide by federal law or other law of this jurisdiction.\n\nComment\n\n…\n\n[21] Paragraphs (c) and (d) do not authorize communications advertising legal services to prospective clients in this jurisdiction by lawyers who are admitted to practice in other jurisdictions. Whether and how lawyers may communicate the availability of their services to prospective clients in this jurisdiction is governed by Rules 7.1 to 7.5.", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "daa9cb7e-326f-41c6-80ac-a2c62e11fa38", "url": "http://abanow.org/2012/06/2012am105b/"}

{"text": "\"Self-Fulfilling Prophecies\" by Cristopher Figuera\n\nWith the beginning of the Guaidó plan, there was a new round of frustrations and disappointments that have accumulated up to the present. Now, the change of agenda in the anti-Chavismo strategy seems to be becoming clearer. A series of elements show that turn.\n\nFor example, the arrival of Manuel Cristopher Figuera, former director of the Bolivarian Intelligence Service (SEBIN), to US soil.\n\nReceived as a hero, he immediately motivated his instrumentalization by Washington. His participation in the attempted coup last April 30 orchestrated mainly by Leopoldo López, according to the organizational chart of Operation Vuelvan Caras presented by the government, was just the spearhead of its cooptation.\n\nHis reappearance in the media scene providing information (to be verified) to US officials and The Washington Post (WaPo) after having spent two months in Colombia under the protection of the government of Iván Duque is a move within that strategic change.\n\nIn the interview with WaPo, he says he has exclusive parts of the \"Maduro secrets\" that, in short, constitute unproven links that the Venezuelan president would have with organizations supposedly related to drug trafficking and terrorism.\n\nFiguera recounts incidents that would confirm these criminal relationships, narratives coinciding with those imposed by the main information agencies that have given greater prominence to these elements in propaganda operations against Venezuela.\n\nPlots of corruption, illegal mining, money laundering, Colombian guerrillas, Cuban interference, drug trafficking and the Venezuelan presidential family are the condiments of the \"leaks\" exposed in WaPo, which serve as a pretext to the argumentative lines exposed by the report of Douglas Farrah, reviewed and analyzed previously here.\n\nOn the other hand, in Figuera's version of the events linked to the preparations of the plan included in Operation Vuelvan Caras, he provides irregular contact data with the conspirators, including the businessman Raul Gorrín, who were in the task of \"turning Maduro loyalists.\"\n\nThe figure of the former head of the SEBIN is already another factor to consider in Washington, where the stratagem of carrying out a de facto judicialization is increasingly influencing the \"deserter figures\" as privileged witnesses, according to the narrative, of the \"Joint Criminal Bolivarian Company\".\n\nCONNECTING THE DOTS\nAlong with the lack of relevant evidence, which is positioned as verified data, the interview is reinforced in noting the immediate past of the source with Chavismo and closeness to President Maduro's most intimate circle.\n\nThe informative operation, in the background, is based on the aforementioned Farrah report presented to the Center for International and Strategic Studies (CSIS), which characterizes the Venezuelan government as a \"joint criminal enterprise\", typified in international law and therefore it serves as a legal figure that directs anti-Chavismo strategy towards judicial courses. All roads lead to the US Department of Justice.\n\nThe document was presented in Washington DC, by its authors Douglas Farah and Caitlyn Yates, both of IBI Consultants, a private intelligence firm. They state that \"the Alliance of the Bolivarian States (ALBA) together with the FARC has merged into what we define as the Bolivarian Joint Criminal Enterprise.\" It brings together representatives of movements that face the United States in El Salvador, Nicaragua and Colombia (Frente Farabundo Martí, Frente Sandinista and the FARC) along with Venezuela under the governments of Hugo Chávez and Nicolás Maduro.\n\nThe central objective of IBI Consultants was to \"designate the government of Nicolás Maduro as a 'transnational criminal organization' or the inclusion of the country in the list of states that sponsor terrorism,\" a first step in the judicial escalation that began a few years ago, through the first denunciations before the International Criminal Court, in The Hague, without anything having happened more than media noise.\n\nAgain, there is a need to connect unproven criminal acts in relation to Petróleos de Venezuela, SA (PDVSA) and its relationship with subsidiaries in the Caribbean region even money laundering by the Central Bank of Venezuela (BCV) with illegally obtained resources, the FARC and the ELN, in illegal mining businesses. All this is based on press reports and inconclusive cases brought by the US judicial system, a loose demonstration of intelligence work just to mention.\n\nWith the introduction of Figuera, they try to outline a \"reliable\" source to support the construction of evidence in the file that is being assembled against the political leaders of the Venezuelan State and Chavismo on the alleged links they have with organizations related to drug trafficking and terrorism allegedly.\n\nThe emphasis on the pre-produced matrix of penetration of the Lebanese political-military organization Hezbollah into Venezuelan territory and the border and mining control by the Colombian guerrillas, cement the construction, in judicial format, of an alternative path of aggression.\n\nA SMALL TURN OF THE NUT\nIn the spheres of US political power there are strong questions about the methods implemented by its Juan Guaidó dolphin, which leads to politically disastrous results, to implement regime change in Venezuela. The clearest signs of discomfort are found in the recordings leaked by WaPo (again) of the meeting of Secretary of State Mike Pompeo with Zionist leaders in New York in early June, where he stated that \"it has been very difficult to keep the opposition united.\"\n\nIt is possible that in Washington they try to calculate new concentration routes with Venezuela to motivate a judicial mobilization against the Bolivarian Government.\n\nWith the passing weeks it becomes increasingly evident that the corruption plot recently unveiled by PanAm Post, led by Guaido's envoys to manage funds of the \"humanitarian aid\" campaign that was executed on the Colombian-Venezuelan border, because the visible actors of the Trump Administration have run the line that associates them with the last prefabricated product of Voluntad Popular (IE. Guaido).\n\nThe data released by Figuera and Farrah are part of damage control due to the slow motion failure that Venezuelans and their enemies have seen during the six months of the coup under the Guaidó umbrella.\n\nEven so, and hand in hand with the cycle of coercive sanctions, the blockade that in its most recent round has meant a precipitation in the fall of the Venezuelan oil production and, consequently, the aggravation of the economic crisis that depends mainly on extractive dynamics, does not show effectiveness in producing a break within the Bolivarian Government.\n\nOn the contrary, they have a counterproductive effect on the international image of the United States government that leaves it exposed as a destabilizing agent of the social conditions of the Venezuelan population. In the words of former diplomat William Brownfield: \"It is necessary to accelerate the collapse of Venezuela.\"\n\nThe combined factors influence the moment of opting for a solution aimed at incriminating the entire structure that makes up the Venezuelan State, transcending the imputations to individual figures and emphasizing the generalization of the criminal component in the connections exposed by Figuera and Farrah, professions self-fulfilled that are not verified but that, with US support, are inputs for aggression.", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "a8475d8c-ff8c-4056-8d46-ef9566c6ef1c", "url": "https://orinocotribune.com/self-fulfilling-prophecies-by-cristopher-figuera/"}

{"text": "MLM Legal professional, Kevin Thompson went after this firm on behalf of the distributors months in the past, and as a substitute of gaining help from the advocates and watchdogs of MLM, he was attacked for his want to guard the typical eFusjon distributor. In the long run the settlement was sealed.\nThen eFusjon filed a lawsuit in opposition to Derek Broes their former Grasp Distributor. As an alternative of taking it laying down, Broes counter sued, and gained. And once more the settlement was sealed from the general public. Nevertheless, Broes did go on to launch a competing firm in the identical area of interest, Revolucion.\nThen final week they inform the eFusjon leaders they have been going to depart Community Advertising behind for different retail alternatives.\nImmediately, they let the world know with the next announcement. And what I superb so disrespectful, is the actual fact the e-mail just isn't even signed by the founders of the corporate who promised the sector the world, after which left them excessive and dry. eFusjon Founders Exit MLM Leaving Distributors Without Incomes\n\n1 COMMENT\n\nTroy, what a complete shocker this is! I can't believe for one second why someone would want to have a home based business in the \"Super Juice Wars' it reminds me of the \"Cell Phone Wars\" If you are in this industry then I would suggest that you sleep with one eye open.\nTroy, People need to get back to the basics of what MLM is all about, everyday products that you are already using! Taking the time to choose the right company. And not getting mixed up in some over rated compensation plan. If you can't find a product that you are truly passionate about then get the hell out of the business, because you don't belong here. I truly do not know how someone could be passionate about a super juice or a cell phone. That really is strange to me.\nKeep up the awesome work Troy!\n\nBud,\nI agree! If people would get bact to the basics, do a little due diligence and ask the hard questions before signing on the dotted line. Then even if the company doesn't make it at least they will have joined with their eyes wide open.\n\nAMEN TO THAT TROY!\nPeople SHOULD DO their Due Diligence and READ Terms, Policies and Procedures / Conditions BEFORE joining ANY company.\nWe'd have to STRONGLY agree with Bud on this one. IF YOU DON'T have a PASSION for the product, service or business with ANY one company __DON'T INVOLVE YOURSELF!\nIF on the other hand you do __then put your knuckles to the ground and GO FOR IT BUT __BE SURE it's what you want. MOST people GET exactly what they ask for and for those who don't it's usually a matter of BUYERS REMORSE OR __INDECISION In the first place!\nSemper Fi\n\nHey Bud,\nGreat comment. What is it about MLM that attracts STRANGE products?\nAlthough it looks like we disagree about the cell phones.. you are spot on! We use cell phones everyday and I think it has great potential in the MLM arena if one company could get it right.\nThanks again,\nJoe\n\nI am forever out of the Juice business, I am now in Wireless!!! I have to say Troy that no matter what people are saying about Chris Grecco he produces. I am now a distributor at TechSoft Mobile, I have been for 38 days now, I have now got two checks since joining, wish I could say here, maybe I can tell you off line.\nI will now try and bring all of my fellow Efusion downline in at Tech Soft Mobile.\nIt seems like everyone is going there. I am very proud of Chris coming clean on the Global Verge issue and Ted Robbins.\nMaybe this is why people are coming in, I know on the call we had some PHP hot shot saying how proud he was to be here.\nWill there be legal liability Troy if Chris is not an Owner?\nI just think this would hurt many people if that is the case, I have had 14 come in under me today.\nIt is growing.\nThanks Troy for all you do.\nJanice.\n\nThis is my first post here. I know Chris an his family well. He comes here to Dublin at least twice a year. I am heading up the Tech Soft company here in Ireland. I currently own a O2 Wireless store here and the ideas and products that Tech Soft is brining here is amazing. I just wanted to let you know Janice that you are in the right place at the right time.\nWe have recently seen a few ads for TechSoft known as Mobile PC here and is launching an Unlimited Talk and Text plan here and in the UK for only 49.00 Euro a month.\nThat's a steal.\nI enjoy the Blog Troy, but please try not to kill my countrymen so much here. People make mistakes.\nLiam O'Connor\nTechSoft Mobile (IRELAND)\nFuture Wireless Millionaire\n\nYour in the right place, and we welcome all of the heart broken eFusion distributors to come in here to TechSoft Mobile. We have home for you.\nI have to say though I was not in this Juice company I was in another that is failing now.\nThis is the first place I have made the money I am making. Personally I do not know how the company is doing it. But I am not complaining. I also despite other posts I have read on this very blog have Rogers Unlimited Talk and Text with 1GB of Data for only $54.95 here at TechSoft Mobile.\nSo I can say right now that without a doubt. We are activating phones in Canada. A distributor has given TechSoft a percentage of a Rogers Store. That is how it is legal. And I am building the first Wireless Business in Canada thanks to TechSoft Mobile.\nBy the way I waited at Global Verge for almost a year.\nI stayed at Global Pros after Chris left, but came into TechSoft after it became clear no one else was able to give me what I needed in Canada.\nI look forward to seeing all of you walk across that stage in Atlanta in October with the largest checks ever to be seen in mlm wireless.\nThank You TechSoft Mobile for giving me and my team the opportunity to build Canada.\nP.S. calling all Canadian Distributors.. I have a spot for you!!\n\nPaul I am afraid you are just crying over spilled milk. I am in Montreal and Chris has provided everything and more for me at TechSoft Mobile. I get unlimited talk text and 1GB of data on Rogers for only $54.95 a month.\nI have done my research and see you are upset because Chris didn't give you some $500.00 phone? Are you 100% sure that it was his fault. I mean I too was being recruited by Global Pros and sad to say looks like their nose is growing as you say. Global Pros is droping massively in the rankings every single day.\nAt 100,000 what happened? And if Chris was so bad why did leaders that even said they were going to stay eventually come over? I have my 4G phone from Chris. I have been paid more here (every week I might add) than I have ever. And if Chris was so bad why have I heard on multiple calls when someone else from here gets on and asks about you he says he has nothing but respect for you and your position is secure when you decide to come over. I don't know about you Paul but I have over 390 people in my Downline and I have only been here 36 days.\nI think Paul that the people who stayed are upset and that is because you bet on the wrong horse.\nLastly word is getting out that your Master distributor Walter is quiting? Why? Is the compensation plan that bad?\nAlso it came out on the call yesterday that we will have exclusivity to Balls Wireless.\nAnd our distributors will be able to offer it with the retail package.\nPaul I have seen you say a lot about tech soft and chris here. All I can say is this, I have been paid, I have been paid more than any other company has paid me, He met his promises to me and my team to come over from ACN. I have an unlimited plan with data that I can't get at a regular rogers store.\nI think that is pretty damn good. Oh by the way I hear Global Pros is saying they wont be getting into Canada at all now. So how are you going to work that business Paul?\nI wish you the Best of Luck. I just hope you don't stay with a dying company the way you did with Global Verge.\nEric Deamarini\nTechSoft Mobile\nCanada Lead Distributor\nRogers Talk Text and 1GB\nof Data only $54.95\n\nPaul I can say I have got my phone and my service my friend, I will admit I was skeptical.\nI am in London and Chris is allowing me to beta test the new MVNO here called Mobile PC.\nThis is unlimited talk and text, right now its free for me. But eventually I will be paying about 49.00 Euro a month for it.\nAll I can say is he has produced and I am building a nice business here in the UK for TechSoft Mobile.\nI wish you luck, I have no worries about credibility, he has followed through on everything for me here. And having this phone in hand is helping me build a big business here.\n\nJoe I agree wireless is great. I am with TechSoft Mobile and am having a blast here!\nI too was in eFusion and that is the last JUICE/NUTRITIONAL company I will ever be apart of. What just happened here was dirty and foul all the way.\nAs for the wireless business I could not be happier. I just got a nice group in from PHP and they are building.\nI got my phone on time. 4G GSM I may add.\nWith the companies software on it, for half what I can buy it for at Walmart. I can say this as a fact. I have been paid at techsoftmobile. I got my phone. I love what I see here.\nIf you think its for you check us out. I will say that don't put stock into everything you hear. I respect you Troy but you have really given Grecco a bad wrap.\nLook at the compensation, look at the products then contact me. I am welcoming all my former eFusion friends in here.\nB. Moore wirelesscashtoday@gmail.com\n\nTroy, this sure is sad to see. At a time when people need hope, one more black eye for the industry 🙁\nBut, for those who have their eyes and minds open, network marketing still offers the little guy the best hope of financial freedom out there.\nKeep up the honest reporting Troy.\nJim\n\nIf the eFusjon distributors want to blame someone they don't need to look any further than Derek Broes. (Troy, that's the guy who keeps sending you shirts and Ipods)… Derek Broes told so many lies and hurt so many people that it was impossible for the comapny to survive. I amazed that it lasted as long as it did….\n\nDavid,\nThanks for stopping by. First the distributors are great folks and they are not looking for anyone to blame. Sadly, the company blamed the distributors for the failure of the MLM marketing channel. But let's look at what you specifically wrote regarding Broes.\nI am not sure if you have read the eFusjon .vs Broes lawsuit or the counter lawsuit. But, I can tell by your comment, you have not been informed of the settlement. I have a few questions if you have time to answer, which might help the members of this community.\n1. What lies did Broes tell, and how could those effect the success of the company since he was never an owner?\n2. Did you hear him state these lies, and can you provide documentation or recordings? I ask for this because I have listened to hours of Broes with eFusjon and have never heard him tell a lie. At least not based on what I have read on the net, or from those who have sent me emails before I interviewed him live on Radio.\n3. If Broes was the cause of the failure, why didn't eFusjon fight to protect their brand, and why did they not file a lawsuit when he launched Revolucion?\nThis will help all who are interested to get more details.\n\nHilry what happened with you and FDI.

I hope you have not confussed anyone who might try to follow you. I know nothing about Trinti but if the leaders jump like Hilry Iam not sure how they will make it.\n\nTroy,\nNo real surpise this happened, I can recall recieving calls from several of the former top leaders in the company, telling of this remarkable comp plan that is patented and if I recall correctly many of the distributors were proclaiming that you can sign up 3 people and \"sit on the beach\" and you will make a lot of money!!

{"text": "More Haircuts And Hairstyle Trends For 2019\n\nNovember 10, 2020\n\nBy Eseandre From cool styles to bright and bold colors, we saw it all in 2018. And from the looks of it, 2019 is on track to bring us more edgy, glamorous and amazing hairstyles. From no-fuss and naturally textured hairstyles to more daring looks, 2019 is going to be an interesting year as well. In this article, we'll discuss some of the styles that will most definitely rock the fashion world in the year to come. So, feel free to use this as a guide to help you as you shop for a new style on CysterWigs. Blunt Fringe\n\nStart 2019 in a big way by making a major statement with your wig. One way to do this is by wearing a style with a blunt fringe or a blunt bang. Rocking this style during the new year will surely make you a trendsetter and you'll be proud that you took a stylish risk. The Blunt Jawline Bob\n\nThe blunt jawline bob is a popular fashion-girl cut that you probably know already. But guess what, it is coming back for 2019, and this time it's much shorter and bolder. According to a popular stylist, Sergio Pattirane from Rob Peetoom Salon in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, when it comes to this style, you'll want a \"straight bob that is shorter at the back, a few inches below your ears, longer at the front, and in line with your jawline.\" By opting for this, you'll end up with a more modern, streamlined bob. If you're a fan of bob wigs, opt for this sleek and chic look for an updated look. Textured Curls\n\nThis is the year to embrace your curl pattern. Textured curls are on the trend radar for 2019. With a top emphasis on texture and volume, this hairstyle shows that you are a bold fashion lover while adding a bit of pop to your personality. So if your bio hair was super-curly, go back to your roots. Look for a curly wig that closely resembles your natural curls. Internal Layers or Ghost Layers\n\nThis cut has been attributed to celebrity hairstylist Ramon Garcia. \"It's a technique that adds movement and texture while giving the illusion of a one-length haircut,\" explained Ramon. This cut removes bulk from the hair without compromising on length. Varying lengths are crucial to this style. The internal layer cut has been compared to the layering of a lion's mane. When it comes to a wig that closely resembles this technique, Ocean by Estetica is a good example of this style. Retro Styling\n\nWe may be heading future-forward, but a lot of 2019's hair trends are going to be blasted from the past. Curtain bangs, brushed out curls, geometric cuts and poker-straight hair are all coming back this year. Hairstyle trends for 2019 seem to be in favor of the feminine retro styles that most of us have seen before.\n\nHair Color Trends For 2019\n\nHere are some hair colors that are expected to trend in 2019:\n\nSmokey Pink: If bubble gum pink always seemed too extreme, this option might be more your speed. Smokey Pink has been described as a more mature version of pink hair. It is softer, sootier and carries sophisticated, smokey undertones. It also works with just about every skin tone.\n\nCopper Velvet: Copper velvet has always been a popular and amazing hair color for people who aren't afraid to make a statement. Well, guess what? It'll still be trendy in 2019. Copper velvet is described as a rich and plush reddish-brown tone. It's very wearable and a luxurious color for many skin tones.\n\nMulti-Colored Tips:\n\nThis is a color mixture style that's finding its way into the new year through a blend of different shades. From Brunette blending into chocolate plum to blonde blending into blue tips, pink tips or even lilac. This multi-colored style is amazing definitely for the adventurous. So there you have it. Some hairstyles, colors, and cuts to rock in 2019. CysterWigs has what you need to stay on-trend...or what you need to create your own trends. Shop today, and make 2019 a happy 'do year", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "a9e10628-c143-45f7-928f-d05a0af73745", "url": "https://cysterwigs.com/blogs/cysterwigs-official-blog/more-haircuts-and-hairstyle-trends-for-2019"}

{"text": "Tottenham Hotspur's brand new 62,000-seater stadium will be home to more than 1,800 digital displays when it officially opens in September this year – more than any other Premier League side.\n\nThe North London-based Premier League club, who has described the new stadium as 'the finest anywhere in the world', is deploying digital signage on mass to help enhance the matchday experience for supporters by communicating information and providing entertainment and marketing.\n\nLG will supply the displays, which feature IPS 4K Nano Cell technologies, and will be placed in the general concourse and premium areas inside the stadium, as well as a wide range of innovative signage products including OLED, UHD and video walls.\n\nTripleplay, based in London, has been selected to provide the end-to-end video platform and deliver all communication and data services through a site-wide IP network.\n\n\"We are delivering the entire IPTV and digital signage platform for the new stadium including EPOS integration for digital menu boards, live match day feeds with low latency encoders,\" Tripleplay's CEO Steve Rickless told AVTE.\n\nTripleplay's IPTV, Digital Signage platform and HD Encoder's have been widely adopted in the sporting arena since entering the sector back in 2010 – five years after its first IPTV and digital signage solution in the enterprise space.\n\nThe new deal with Tottenham, takes Tripleplay's presence at Premier League clubs to above 70 per cent, including; Manchester City (900 displays), Chelsea, Southampton, Brighton and Bournemouth.\n\n\"Our system was selected as its proven both within the English premier League with over 70 per cent using Tripleplay,\" explained Rickless. \"We have other sites where we can easily demonstrate and show we can support over 1,500 endpoints (such as Wimbledon), which was a key requirement for Tottenham.\"\n\nHe added: \"It started off in South Africa for the World Cup in 2010. That was our first involvement in a World Cup.\n\n\"That got us into the world of stadiums and sport and on the back of that, we won Brighton's Amex Stadium. We then got very involved with Chelsea at Stamford Bridge when they were looking to upgrade from coax to IP.\n\n\"Really then it all started to snowball into the sports and arenas market. Once it built up and built out in the UK, we started getting a few more enquiries in Europe.\n\nRickless added Tripleplay's experience in the sporting arena has seen significant evolution of its technology, both in terms of making it easier to use, reliable and providing added benefits to clubs and ultimately their customers.\n\n\"It's reliable and it works, which is what they want,\" he explained. \"For a sporting event, they can't afford to go wrong.\n\n\"We have an easy to use interface and can provide 100's of zones if required. People are looking for something that isn't Cisco, which is complicated and expensive.\n\n\"We have failover built into the system and will shortly be adding support for Opta stats as part of signage as well as social media feeds, providing a true stadium experience. Coupled with the fact we already provide our system into Tottenham's training ground and offices known as Lilly White House we have been actively involved in supporting the platform and the club.\"\n\nBest of the rest\n\nTottehnam Hotspur has previously announced that Daktronics, Harman and Musco have all be chosen as major technology supplier for the new stadium.\n\nJumbo screens\n\nDaktronics has been selected to supply four bespoke main LED video displays for the stadium bowl totalling more than 1,000 square metres.\n\nThis includes two screens in the iconic, single tier 17,500 South Stand, each measuring 325 square metres making them the largest screens in any stadium in Western Europe and among the biggest in the world.\n\nTwo additional screens in the North Stand, will each measure 190.7 square metres, while two LED video displays will feature on the South West and South East façades, fitted on the exterior of the stadium, will each measure 178.9 square metres.\n\nEvery main display will feature 13HD pixel layouts to bring excellent image clarity and contrast for everyone that visits the stadium.\n\nThe stadium bowl will also include three tiers of digital ribbon – a first for any European stadium.\n\nThe upper and middle tier ribbons will run from the East to West Stands through the North Stand measuring 387 metres and 348 metres long, respectively, while the suite-tier ribbon will be split into two runs along the East and West Stands, measuring 122 metres long on the East stand and 105 metres long on the West.\n\nMatthew Collecott, director of operations, Tottenham Hotspur said: \"We are pleased to add Daktronics to our roster of world-leading suppliers, as specialists in large LED video displays and digital ribbon boards. We have pushed them to deliver something that will truly set us apart and these installations will play a significant role as part of our commitment to setting a new standard in fan experience in sports and entertainment.\"\n\nDaktronics president and CEO Reece Kurtenbach said: \"We're extremely proud to partner with one of the most storied football clubs in England. The video displays and LED technology in this stadium are sure to help enhance the atmosphere for fans and players alike. We're excited to see the stadium open later this year.\"\n\nAudio\n\nThe Club has also selected Harman Professional Audio Solutions as its Official Audio Supplier.\n\nThe partnership will see Harman supply a range of its leading audio products including amplifiers, subwoofers and JBL Professional loudspeakers that will complement the state of the art facilities at the club's new stadium, which includes the largest screens in any stadium.\n\nCollecott added: \"Harman Professional Solutions is an industry-leading provider of world-class audio solutions, and we are pleased to announce them as the official audio supplier for our new state-of-the-art stadium.\"\n\nChris Smith, VP, EMEA, Harman Professional Solutions, said: \"Tottenham Hotspur is one of the most historic and prestigious clubs in football, and Harman Professional Solutions is honoured to provide a cutting-edge audio solution at their incredible new stadium.\"\n\nLighting\n\nFinally, Musco will provide all solutions related to lighting the pitch at the Club's new stadium.\n\nA total of 324 floodlights will be mounted on the underside of the stadium's roof in clusters of six. The optically advanced LED system will require only 450kW of power, which is around 50 per cent less energy consumption than a traditional metal halide floodlighting system.\n\nThe new stadium will also play host to NFL matches, music concerts and a range of other events, creating a new world-class sports and entertainment venue for London.\n\nThe lighting meets all UEFA and NFL requirements as well as having the ability to produce incredible light shows that can be used for a range of major events.\n\n\"Musco has specialised in the design and manufacture of stadium lighting solutions for over 40 years,\" said Collecott. \"Their experience and ability to provide pioneering solutions for arenas and stadiums around the world gives us the utmost confidence in their capabilities to deliver the best solution for the Club's new stadium.\"\n\nJeff Rogers, VP of sales, Musco Lighting concluded: \"We are excited to partner with Tottenham Hotspur and provide an LED lighting system that will meet this iconic Club's unique needs at its new stadium.\n\n\"Our system will offer an enhanced entertainment experience for the fans, with superior light quality and visibility, and it will also help the Club in its efforts to reduce its environmental footprint.\"", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "126ff436-6389-4925-87a4-2ed0ebe65e23", "url": "https://www.installation-international.com/technology/tottenham-sign-tripleplay-to-provide-premier-matchday-experience-for-fans"}

I highly recommend this book to everyone.\n\nEven men could get a lot from this book!\n\nI invite everyone to get this book, follow it, and get closer to God as He draws closer to you.

{"text": "Matches for \"Addington Raceway\" toPremier harness racing returns to Addington on Friday night as the track hosts a number of feature races.\nHere we look into the even fields and high-class battles that'll keep fans interested.\nThe first of the feature events on the card comes around at 7.09pm.\nThe NZB Standardbred Harness Million 2YO Mobile Trot sees the flying Highgrove look to extend his dominance over his peers and he'd only need to produce another run as good as his recent Ashburton victory to do so. As with younger stock race manners will define fortunes here so it'll be fingers and hooves crossed for the connections of most of these juveniles. The draws have brought out some interesting potential scenarios too with Toro Stride and One Tree Hill having the opportunity to press forward from inside barriers while the Jason and Megan Teaz trained visitor in Emma Joy faces a frosty welcome to Addington given her #7 alley. All things considered the Dunn trained speed merchant does look the one here.\nRace 8, due to be run at 8.10pm, sees the running of the Lone Star Sires Stakes Aged Trotters Classic at Listed level. It's a small field but while it might lack for numbers it doesn't lack for quality.\nThe progressive Majestic Lavros has looked very good at recent workouts and trials while the Hope trained Midnight Dash always gives his best and has runs on the board recently with a very sound 4th in behind Muscle Mountain. Along with those chances they'll be two whispers going around, one for the N Williamson trained flyer in Chinese Whisper, and the other one being the fact that the brilliant Oscar Bonavena may well be back to somewhere near his best. An intriguing race.\nThe aged trotting feature is quickly followed by the 9th of on the card, the Nevele R Fillies Series Final at Group 1 level.\nThe last running of the event saw Amazing Dream prove too good for a classy field with the overall time a strong 2.20.3 over the 1980m mobile trip.\nThe Purdon / Rasmussen partnership has enjoyed a strong presence in the recent history of the race with Elle Mac, Spanish Armada and Dream About Me all having their names etched into the trophy recently. Historic winners of the race include the great Armalight (1980) Tigerish (1992) and the Anthony Butt driven Under Cover Lover who captured the title in 1998.\nThis edition of the race will see Bettor Twist having to overcome a second row draw to claim victory. That task looks a difficult one given the depth of this field with Bettor Talk Art, Lifes A Beach,Darling Me and Off N Gone all enjoying front line draws. Throw in the Brian and Gareth Hughes trained The Honey Queen and the Mark Jones trained La Rosa and you have a very strong field indeed. Possibly the most competitive field of the night.\nThe feature racing on the card concludes with the running of the NZB Standardbred Harness Million 2YO Colts and Geldings Mobile Pace which is due to be run and won at 9.40pm.\nThe champion Krug won the last running of the event in November of last year, other notable names that would catch your eye on the trophy include superstars Changeover (2006) Stunin Cullen (2008) and Lazarus (2015)\nIt's an interesting field this time around made a little more interesting by barrier draws.\nAt first look Akuta would seem favoured to strike the front and possibly keep it from his cosy #4 barrier (subject to emergencies coming out) Cosmic Major,on exposed form, looks hard to beat but will have to earn the silverware here from a second line draw. Other factors in the race could be the strong northern raider Montana D J (drawn #3) and Franco Mac who'll be able to take the shortest way around the Addington track from his #1 barrier.\nIt's a very good race night on Friday at Addington. Let's hope the weather is fine and the champions put their best performances onto the track for all to enjoy.\nBen Mcmillan\n\nView the harness racing results from Addington click here.\nMichael House deflected praise after producing both Smokin Annie and Cha Cha B to win at Addington on Tuesday.\nSmokin Annie continued her brilliant form the man who arguably rates as New Zealand's most enterprising trainer when scoring a front-running win for driver Sheree Wigg.\nSmokin Annie has won three times has never been further back than fifth since joining House's stable.\n\"It is not just my effort, it is the effort of my wonderful staff and some great drivers,\" the trainer said.\n\"I would say she was always a reasonable horse but when she came to me she had some issues with her feet, she had quarter-cracks.\"\n\"They have resolved themselves, I can't take the credit there, my blacksmith gets the credit.\"\n\"And the drivers have driven her well.\"\n\"Sarah O'Reilly drove her well at Manawatu and whoever has jumped on her has driven her well.\"\n\"And Sheree drove her great today.\nSmokin Annie, raced on lease by House from Southland breeder Paul Hailes, is now likely to head back to her home province.\n\"I am going to send her down south for the mares series that is coming up down there for the rating 50-59s.\"\nHouse again poured praise on his driver when Cha Cha B took out race 3.\nBlair Orange made a mid-race move with the six-year-old and slotted him into a sweet trip in the one-one set up his victory.\n\"It was a great drive, the trainer can't take the credit there, the driver won that one.\"\nHouse's Addington double following on from his win at Rangiora on Sunday with Rake.\nThe victory was the pacer's sixth since joining House's stable two years ago.\n\"Rake is a good horse.\"\n\"When I first got him I put lengths on him and everyone that deals with him just loves him.\"\n\"I won too much with him and it took a long time for him to come back down (in rating) to where he could win again.\"\n\"He actually tries too hard, he is not a great horse for the ratings system because he runs a lot of fourths, fifths and sixths and doesn't lose too many points.\"\n\"The other day was good and he could do it again if he found the right race.\"\n\"But then he would be in trouble.\"\nHouse said a major factor in his three wins over the past four days was having each horse in what he called the 'right race'.\nThe trainer said the spread of horses across wide ratings bands in Canterbury was problematic for horses, especially rated in the lower 40s.\n\"For example, there were nine races which a rating 40 horse could gone in last weekend,\" House said.\n\"And that displaces those horses and they become field fillers.\"\n\"There were a number of 40-48 bracket that don't go anywhere and their starts to win ratio is very high.\"\nHouse said with more streamlined programming and tighter rating bands in Canterbury the horse population would be served better.\n\"I go back to what they told us when the rating system came in – race like with like.\"\nHouse has also produced good results recently from his Southland stable recently with Johnny Mac and Changearound both saluting.\nHouse said the programming of races in Southland is not such an issue.\n\"Southland is a little different to what we do here.\"\n\"We get them ready here and then send them down.\"\n\"They are there to race every week and if their form tails off or they get a bit tired they come back to Canterbury.\"\n\"Tyler Dewe is doing a great job down there for me.\"\nHouse starts eight horses from his Invercargill barn at Winton on Saturday.\nBy Jonny TurnerShereeView the Addington harness racing fields click here!\nBy Joshua Smith, Harness News Desk\nGroup Three winner Pres The Belle will be looking to get her career back on track at Addington Raceway on Friday.\nThe 13-win mare has had four starts for her new trainers, Geoff and James Dunn, and they believe she is capable of recording her first victory in their colours in the Haras des Trotteurs Heather Williams Memorial Mobile Trot (1980m).\nShe has failed to flatter since joining the West Melton barn, but showed a glimpse of her former self when winning by five lengths in her 2600m trial last week.\n\"We have changed her front shoes and she has trotted really well at the trials, so hopefully she can do it at Addington,\" James Dunn said.\n\"She doesn't like Addington as much as other tracks, but she has been going good enough.\n\"This is probably the most winnable race she has come up against since we have had her. If she brings her manners and doesn't pull too hard, she should be a good chance.\"\nPres The Belle will come up against the likes of Group Three winner Splash Cola and in-form mare Gold Chains, but Dunn believes his mare is capable of holding her own on Friday.\n\"Splash Cola is pretty good when they bring their A-game over the short trip, but Gold Chain is flying,\" he said.\n\"Pres The Belle is the class horse of the field. At her best she would be very hard to beat, but she is not there anymore, so we have got to get her 90-95 percent and she should be in the top three.\"\nDunn will also line-up Laver in the Dunstan Horsefeeds Mobile Pace (1980m) after he disappointed when fading late at Addington in his last start in March.\nHe has subsequently freshened and has pleased in his resuming trials where he has placed and won in the lead up to Friday.\n\"He was well short for that last start and after that we found out he was a little bit crook, so we have treated him and gave him some time, took him back to the trials and started again,\" Dunn said.\n\"He is still quite heavy. He got away on us a little bit. That is a good sign, it usually means he is pretty well.\n\"We are using this as a fitness run looking towards the Jewels.\"\nThe Dunns final runner of the night will be Derby placegetter The Falcon, who put in a subpar performance at Rangiora last month.\n\"He was disappointing last start,\" Dunn said. \"We probably asked him to come out of the gate a little bit (hard) and maybe backing up from the Derby he just found it a bit tough.\n\"We have given him a bit of a freshen-up.

{"text": "The Heirloom Brides Collection!\n\nI just finished reading The Heirloom Brides Collection (various authors). The Heirloom Brides Collection contains four short historical Christian romance stories. Something Old by Tracey Bateman is set in Tucker's Creek, Kansas in 1880. Betsy Lowell is going to town with her grandfather, Pops to stock up on supplies for the winter or so she thinks. Stuart Fields runs the local general store with his mother. He has been entranced with Betsy since they were children. Betsy is very stubborn, determined, and prideful. Will Stuart be able to get past Betsy's tough exterior?\n\nThe second story is Joanne Bischof's Something New set in the Blue Ridge Mountains in 1893. Wren Cromwell and her family have been taking in lodgers since the death of her herbalist father. Their latest guest is Tate Kennedy who was Wren's best friend (and more). Tate left the community four years ago and has just returned. He is finally able to provide for Wren. Will Wren accept him back after all this time?\n\nSomething Borrowed by Kim Vogel Sawyer is the third story in the collection set in 1881. Clara Rose Frazier and her father, Ezra have moved to a farm to start a new life. Clara wanted to get away from the town where everyone knew she had lost two beaus (because they would not accept her and her father). When her father gets injured, they need assistance on the farm. Clara finds help on the Klaassen farm. The Frazier's moved to Wilhelmina, Minnesota which is a large Mennonite community. Maria Klaassen volunteers her son, Titus to help out the Frazier's. Will Clara be able to overcome the past to have a beautiful future?\n\nThe last story is Something Blue by Mona Hodgson. Darla May Taggart has finished her nursing training in Philadelphia and is returning to Cripple Creek, Colorado (set in 1900). Darla grew up in the town with her pastor father. Darla was rather wild when she was seventeen and is hoping to overcome her past. Darla is assigned to be a home care nurse. One of her patients is Nicolas Zanzucchi. He was burned on the back when a steam hose broke in the Mollie Kathleen Mine. Nicolas is raising his three daughters (Julia, Jocelyn, and Jaya) on his own. Nicolas has to stay still and not break open the scabs that have formed over the burns on his back. Darla is attracted to this heartwarming family, but will Darla's past come back to haunt her?\n\nThe Heirloom Brides Collection is a lovely collection of stories. I give The Heirloom Brides Collection 4 out of 5 stars. The stories are all nicely written and easy to read. I enjoyed reading them. My favorite was Something Borrowed by Kim Vogel Sawyer. I liked the loving and warm Mennonite community. Ms. Sawyer really brought the characters to life. My least favorite was Something Old. I found it to be a very frustrating story. Betsy was made into this tough, stubborn, determined, prideful person who would rather sit in the snow and freeze to death than ask for help. I just found it to be overdone. Overall, the Heirloom Brides Collection are good stories. If you enjoy historical, Christian romance stories, you will enjoy The Heirloom Brides Collection.\n\nI received a complimentary copy of The Heirloom Brides Collection from NetGalley in exchange", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "31836242-75f7-4e11-8277-63f265162ec4", "url": "https://t.alibris.com/The-Heirloom-Brides-Collection-Treasured-Items-Bring-Couples-Together-in-Four-Historical-Romances-Tracey-V-Bateman/book/32368417"}
{"text": "Naasón Joaquín García greets members of his church La Luz del Mundo in Guadalajara, Mexico, in August 2018. (AP file photo)\n\n(CN) — A state appeals court tossed on procedural grounds a case involving charges of child rape and human trafficking against the leader of a Mexican megachurch who lived in Southern California.\n\nA three-judge panel of the California Second District Court of Appeals unanimously ruled that state prosecutors made a procedural error that violated Naason Joaquin García's rights to a speedy trial and threw out the criminal complaint against him based on that error.\n\n\"Absent a personal and express time waiver by García, he was entitled to a preliminary hearing within the statutory period applicable to the amended complaint,\" California Associate Justice Laurie Zelon wrote on behalf of the panel in the 33-page ruling.\n\nGarcía neither waived his right to the hearing nor was he given it within the stipulated time period, meaning the case should be dismissed, the justice wrote.\n\nGarcía, the self-proclaimed apostle of La Luz del Mundo — which means \"The Light of the World\" in Spanish — was arrested in June and accused of participating in human trafficking and child rape. He was arrested alongside his associates, Susana Medina Oaxaca and Alondra Ocampo, who were all charged with a total of 29 felony counts. All three have denied wrongdoing and pleaded not guilty.\n\nWhen García and the other defendants were initially arraigned on the criminal complaint filed by the state of California in June, García personally waived his right to a speedy preliminary hearing. However, after the state filed an amended complaint in July that contained three more felony charges, García was not offered the choice to waive another preliminary hearing within ten days.\n\nGarcía says that failure to offer another preliminary hearing was a violation of the state and federal constitution that protects defendants' rights to a speedy trial.\n\nOn Tuesday, a three-judge panel agreed.\n\n\"García's July 16, 2019 arraignment and plea on the amended complaint was a new triggering event that required a preliminary hearing to be held within 10 court days absent García's personal time waiver,\" Zelon wrote.\n\nIt is not clear how Tuesday's dismissal affects the other defendants in the case.\n\nThe state has argued the amended complaint is not a triggering event and since García already waived his right to a preliminary hearing, he has no grounds for asking for dismissal.\n\nBut the panel disagreed, instead issuing the ruling that ordered the lower court to dismiss the complaint against García.\n\nThe California Attorney General's Office said it was still reviewing the ruling but noted García remained in custody.\n\nThe state could appeal to the California Supreme Court. Should it get tossed, the dismissal of such a high-profile case involving such heinous crimes on procedural grounds would amount to a significant misstep for state prosecutors.\n\nThe ruling also shed light on other material missteps by the prosecution, who were at one point found to be in contempt of court by Superior Court Judge Theresa Sullivan due to a failure to produce discovery ordered by the court.\n\nA phone call to García's lawyer, Alan Jackson, was not immediately returned Tuesday.\n\nGarcía was a minister in Los Angeles and other parts of Southern California before becoming the church's leader.\n\nState prosecutors accused García of coercing underage girls into performing sex acts by telling them that refusing would be going against God, the initial indictment said.\n\nAuthorities alleged that García forced the victims, who were members of the church, to sexually touch themselves and each other. One of his co-defendants allegedly took nude photographs of the victims and sent the pictures to García, according to the criminal complaint.\n\nGarcía told one of the victims and others in 2017 after they had completed a \"flirty\" dance wearing \"as little clothing as possible,\" that kings can have mistresses and an apostle of God cannot be judged for his actions, the complaint states.\n\n\"Crimes like those alleged in this complaint have no place in our society. Period,\" California Attorney General Xavier Becerra said in June when the charges were filed. \"We must not turn a blind eye to sexual violence and trafficking in our state.\"\n\nBecerra's investigation began in 2018, prompted in part by a tip to the California Department of Justice through an online clergy abuse complaint form.\n\nThe dismissal, should it happen, would add another layer of embarrassment for California and the U.S., as the case was widely perceived to be an example of how the administration of justice in America was superior to how it operates in Mexico.\n\nThere were similar allegations made against García and La Luz del Mundo in Mexico for years but nothing official ever materialized. For instance, in 1997, García's father was accused of sexual abuse of minors but charges were never filed.\n\n\"It shows the enormous difference between the quality of law enforcement in Mexico and the United States,\" sociologist Bernardo Barranco of the Center for the Study of Religions in Mexico told the Associated Press in June. \"In Mexico, unfortunately, there is an innate protection for clergy, not just for the Luz del Mundo.\"", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "6dfbcdcd-9f09-41d9-8c11-596be1338d3f", "url": "https://www.courthousenews.com/child-rape-charges-against-mexican-megachurch-leader-tossed-on-technicality/"}

{"text": "Categories\n\nMeta\n\nSports Gambling Games\n\nOnline sports gambling games can be hugely thrilling and rewarding for gamblers who have established a good betting strategy and do their research. Registering with the first sports betting site you discover on Google and betting all your money away as quickly as possible is an unwise decision. Here are some good tips that every bettor should consider when they want to get involved with sports gambling games.\n\nSports Gambling Games Tip #1\n\nResearch, research, research. Whichever sport you're betting on – hockey, cricket, soccer, horse racing, or whatever – you must know what's going on. Browse the sports section of your daily newspaper or subscribe to a professional sports website to obtain daily 토토사이트 articles and news release updates. The more you know, the more strategically it is possible to place your bets.\n\nSports Gambling Games Tip #2\n\nWhatever you do, usually do not bet your complete life savings using one individual game or event. This is often tempting for beginners, especially for those who have such a strong belief in a particular team pulling a win. Even though you have experienced a pretty big winning streak already, you don't want to push your luck. Slow and stead is the better strategy to use. The more strategic your betting methods become, the more money you can win and therefore increase your betting fund to help you expand on that. That's the way the experts do it.\n\nSports Gambling Games Tip #3\n\nBeing a fan of the activity you're betting on helps a lot. If you don't know any thing about cricket and really do not care much for it nevertheless, you want to win some money, you probably won't do very well. Knowledge always helps, therefore you need to bet on the sports that you most enjoy watching or playing yourself. Knowing the players, the team chemistry, statistical information, who's injured or playing poorly, along with other information is required if you wish to have the best odds of winning your bets.", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "6696e25f-5fd5-4bb0-9034-f3d447bfbddd", "url": "http://akosgarai.com/sports-gambling-games/"}

Nectar Sleep has actually been in business considering that 2016. Due to how brand-new the company is, we're basing our toughness rankings off of the products utilized in the bed, quality of building and construction, and owner experience data in time.\n\nWhile we suggest the Nectar for typical to heavyweight sleepers, there is always the possibility of body impressions gradually, so we advise rotating the mattress regularly.

Sound from a mattress is usually connected with a coil system in the support core or comfort layers. Since the Nectar includes an all-foam design, we found absolutely no noise issues with the bed.

While there Chase starts up a conversation with a hot redhead named Faith and the two end up sharing a night of passion.\n\nBack in Yorkshire Falls Chase can't get his mind off of Faith. Imagine Chase's surprise when Madeline calls him with a proposition he can't pass up…..watch out for her stepdaughter Sloane who is headed to Yorkshire Falls in exchange for a big exclusive when the time is right. Imagine Chase's even bigger surprise when he realizes that Sloane is actually Faith!\n\nSloane had overheard some shocking news and decided to go to Yorkshire Falls, NY to find some answers. Imagine Sloane's surprise to run into Chase, her one-night stand that she thought she'd never see again! When Sloane confides in Chase her reason for being in town, he decides to help her. Of course the more time these two spend together, they find themselves right where they left off in D.C. When Sloane's investigation ends up becoming dangerous, things between her and Chase start to really heat up. Just when Sloane is starting to get her answers, things turn to crap and Sloane's life starts to fall apart. All Sloane really wants is her perfect happy ending. Chase will really need to look deep within himself before he can realize what he really wants in his life…and of course that will be Sloane. Now he just needs to convince her of that in order to get their happy ever after!\n\nI just LOVED Chase! He always put his family before himself and he always did what was right and expected of him. I also loved that Chase was tall, dark and sexy ( just look at the cover….YUM! ) I also loved Sloane. She was smart and sassy and provided a challenge for Chase as he would accept no less! Together they made for a perfect couple.

{"text": "Once again the promoters of the All Chrysler Nationals at the Carlisle Fair Grounds put on a great show, despite a bit of wet weather for some of the time. The total count of cars on the show field was 2150, not a record, but not bad either, especially considering last year's heat wave which may have scared a number of people away.\n\nOur tent was busy with a number of members in and out, and we had some great cars at the show this year. Leading the group was Merl Wolfer's gorgeous Tahitian Coral D coupe, all the way from Oregon, which captured First Place in the letter car class in the people's judging, and also a Celebrity Choice Award from Herb McCandless.\nGeorge Glavis was also there with his white D coupe from Virginia. We had three F's in attendance, Tony Rinaldi's white convertible, Jean-Yves Chouinard's white F coupe, down from Canada, and Ed Howe's red coupe, an Oregon car bearing Florida plates. Jay Robinson also had an F coupe for sale in the car corral. There was one G on the field, that belonging to Mike Falcone, and Benny Buckner had one for sale in the car corral. Jerry Olson had the '61 Bat Wagon on the field and took 3rd place in the letter car judging and a Celebrity Choice Award as well.\n\nMark Souders had his beautiful H on the field, and captured 2nd place in the letter car judging, plus a Celebrity Choice Award, and Charlie Valentine's 62 Sport Convertible took a 2nd place award in the non-letter 300 class.\nWe only had one K this year, and that was John Plosila's convertible, but we had three members with their L's, including Jeff Miklas, Dave Morrison with a convertible, and Doug Mayer, all the way from Maine. Dan Holovacko had a '66 300 at the show, and the always present Allan and Gloria Moon, of course, had their 300 Hurst, \"Thirsty.\" All in all, we wound up with 11 cars at the show - why we don't get more is beyond me, although our G and Tom Cox's F both had last minute issues that prevented their being at the show, so I guess we were part of the problem.\n\nIn addition to those who brought cars, we had a number of members at the tent, including Alan Alkus, Bob Dotta, Jamie Hyde, Tom & Dannis Cox, Don Verity, Dave and Carolyn Schwandt, Troy McKenzie, Dave Clelland, Bill Allen, Bob Wahl, Bob Haag, Paul Wimmer, Nancy Kramer, John Cote, John Begian, Jonathan Rudy, Lynn Nelson and Ron & Anita Krauth. DeAndrea Vantree, from the West coast, who usually gets the non-driver long distance title, was at the show, but lost out for long distance recognition this year to Tony Cavoli, who was visiting all the way from Melbourne, Australia.\n\nAs usual, we had a great time visiting with each other, looking at beautiful cars, buying or selling parts (some of us), and finding great places to eat. It is always a pleasure to attend this show, regardless of the weather, and I wish more of you would come and bring your cars. We have good deals on lodging, and it is within reasonable driving distance for many of you. If we can get cars from Oregon, Canada and Maine to this show, why can't we get more cars from Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Ohio, Maryland and New York? In this case, the more really means the merrier, so please think about coming next year.", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "745b9b49-a590-40db-8b1a-803b06f537b1", "url": "https://www.chrysler300club.com/newsletter/10/cac/2013.html"}
{"text": "The Unoffical Blog Of 18 Time Serie A Winners Inter Milan\n\nInter vs Fiorentina match day preveiw #232\n\nFollowing a roller coaster ride last season it's the time we've all been waiting for the start to Inter's 2020-21 season. Inter in this opening match welcome visitors Fiorentina. Fiorentina won their first match of the season last week against Torino. Inter are one match behind due to them playing in the Europa League final in a eventual loss to Sevilla. But their match against Benevento will be played four days after this opening match. The last time Inter played Fiorentina they played to a 0-0 draw. Overall majority of their matches against each other have ended in a draw but win wise Inter have the advantage. Fiorentina are looking to add another win to the victory column while Inter are looking to get their season started on the right foot. Here is what to expect in Inter's first match of the campaign.\n\nIn this match here is who you can expect to start and players who to look out for. On Fiorentina they'll have some inside knowledge of how Inter works as Valero and Biraghi joined their ranks. These two players will know what to expect from their now former club which in my opinion will give them the slight edge on how to take Inter out. Another player that sees the game in great vision is Cheisa he is good at getting the ball in tight spaces and is good at finishing scoring chances. Even when assisting he is good at getting the ball from points a to point b quick and efficently if Inter don't stop him he will cause them issues. Another player they need to look out is Milenkovic who is also very good at getting the ball into tight spaces and doing what is needed to get the job done. Now for the home side there are a few new faces to look out for along with returning ones. The first of the new faces is Hakimi who is a great defender and who scored against Inter causeing them to exit the Champions League last season. He is solid at tackles and setting up the counter attack with ease. The next one is Vidal who is good at assisting and in regards to free kicks they added the addition of Kolorov. Returning from loan are Pinamonti which doesn't make sense as he'll mostly sit in the bench. Can't forget the return of Radja and Perisic who will be great for depth issues. The players however Fiorentina will need to focus on are the strike force of Lukaku and Martinez these two are a unstoppable force as they both good at excecuting goal chances especially inside the box.\n\nThis match for Inter will not be an easy win. Fiorentina are fast on the ball especially on the counter attacks. That and with two former Inter players on their squad who pretty much know their moves and tactics can help Fiorentina exploit their weaknesses. Also Cheisa is not going to be dormant he is going to fight tooth and nail to get all three points. Inter however will be the stronger side on paper but the real question will be is if what's on paper translates to the pitch. Inter have some of the best strikers and Lukaku and Martinez will go out and try and destroy Fiorentina but they still have a solid defense who will look to shut them down. I think based on both sides being closely match this match will end 2-1 win going to Inter though it will be close but Inter have the advantage in all areas but Fiorentina will have the heart and determination.", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "730c1a36-0537-432b-8f41-7c0a4b465d7a", "url": "https://thegalleriaofinternazionalemilano.com/2020/09/24/inter-vs-fiorentina-match-day-preveiw-232/"}

This room should have been thoroughly cleaned and adequately aired before another guest was expected to sleep there.\nI don't know whether it was because I booked through a third party or not, but I am inclined to think that this was why I was given the worst room in the hotel.\nMy 'king bed' was not a king bed at all but actually two singles pushed together and the room was situated directly above the laundry. The heating took several hours to warm the room, there was no electric blanket and the bed spread was summer weight and nowhere near adequate to the task.\nWhen I checked out a day early at 6am the following morning, the staff member didn't query why, or whether I'd had a nice stay, or what the hotel could have done better. And he certainly didn't offer me a refund for the unused portion of my stay.\nI should have asked to be moved immediately upon arrival, but didn't want to be a troublesome guest.\nThe one saving grace was the lovely gentleman who checked me in, but given the fact that he was the one who allocated me to that room, niceties don't count for much.\nNeedless to say, the smell, the cold and the general dampness prevented a good night's sleep and I won't be staying at this hotel again in the future.\n\nLovely hotel with stylish decor and very comfortable bed!

So off we went to the first annual Uncle Vinny fishing derby in celebration of him. Great guy....coast guard vet, NJ Correction Officer, father to 2 great boys and an awesome friend who will be missed. Heading to wake today and getting ready for a hard day. Hug your friends and family today in memory of Uncle Vinny. We left a pole on the rock for you Vin...\n\nSorry havent posted anything contributing in a while, just been swamped with real estate deals and painting.\nAnyway, wife and I were able to get out of town end of July for 2 weeks to Mexico, trip was awesome, and with the pandemic, i think Mexcico, at least were we were, were totally safe and took precautions everywhere we went.\nI brought light/medium action spinning gear and fished primarily all species with them, so a lot of fun not using the captains broomsticks for everything.\nTrip was by far, best on been to in a while, 1st resort was good, but its a fishing resort and we fished are asses off everyday for 4 days, one day rest and off to Cabo for 7 days.\nHotel Palma De Cortez was 1st resort and then we stayed in Grand Solmar Lands End for the remainder of the 2 weeks...the 2nd place was really nice.\nGreat trip and a lot of great memories!\n\nI love this thing I know I did a review on it last year this is what it looks like going over 20 inch blow down with four bags of corn Little to no effort even for an old man like me\nHawk Crawler Game Cart\n\nA great test for all when practicing/ shooting longer shots in a adrenaline heightened hunting state is to shoot a \"steel\" deer at those longer distances. It's amazing that even good shooters start to fall apart knowing their arrow will be destroyed if not making the shot. The hole in most steel deer is usually 4-6\" which imo should be the maximum group size that any archer should shoot at any deer.\n\nI have been there twice now - brisket is tender and the ribs just fall off of the bone.\nThe management are very customer focussed.\nI highly recommend it to anyone in that area or passing through that area.\n\nThanks for the explanation!\ni mean for real if you got the money to go hunt in Africa you should also buy the best equipment. Just imagine the animal survived due to failed equipment and you payed thousands of $ for nothing because you \"saved\" $70 on a broad head!\n\nAs a bonus you get pork roll, bacon, back fat and ham hocks with a side of butt sweat in one package. Some people are just full of educate and considerate of others that they just entitled to their own butt chiller.\n\nHORRIBLE!! Worst weekend I ever had on the lake. Fished for 7 hours yesterday and had 3 bites all day. Two of the salmon were about 1 lb each. Lost the other. July was very good, August....fish shutdown (salmon). Hopefully it gets better. Painful to say the least.\n\nThis topic came up with my family recently. If you could only have one or the other, not both...\nWould you rather have a ocean front or bay front beach house, OR a house up in the mountains for vacation purposes?\nWhy and where would you prefer one if it was given to you?\nTough choice. But there is something about salt water with family that cleanses the soul for me....\n\nGot you beat. I was loading up during the old days of the bowhunters jamborees. I was buying 5-6 dozen Eastons for $3.25 each. I also loaded up on closeouts with Muzzy broadheads. I had bought 11 packs for $7.00 each at Walmart, 7 packs at Tractor Supply for 9.99 and a few other places. I want my deer within 30 yds max. I should not need the best bolt and broadhead to kill deer from that distance. I do shoot that combo from my tenpoint and they fly true.\n\nI just got finished broadcasting the oats and the remaining soybeans. Dont know what the beans will do we will see but they were left overs so no big deal. Im saturated. Raining pretty good here. Ill start with some rye and wheat in about 2 weeks or so depending on the rain then follow up again with some more rye and wheat beginning of October. I also overseeded and mowed my clover plots yesterday. Perfect timing with the rain.\nClover is bouncing back nicely from the heat\n\nGot the 28 in the ambush green. I absolutely love this bow, when shooting I do not want to put it down. It is quiet and very dead in the hand. I got the Mathews 4 arrow quiver and QAD drop away rest and an Apex 3 pin sight. Good luck with yours!\n\nBishop heads are worth every penny. I have some. They're indestructible and if you do damage one, send it back and they replace it for free.\nI haven't been on their website in a while, but depending on size, they go from $100 apiece and up. Not terrible considering you technically never have to spend $ on heads ever again\n\nMountains for me. I've lived 6 blocks from the Bay and 15 miles from SH for 22yrs and never go there.

If i remove the blinker, there is a reasonably large opening that goes right to my filter and i figure if i want to go down to the city or just have fun in my car when i know it wont rain or something i can just swap out the regular turn signal for the open one to feed air to my filter.

{"text": "Sunday Morning Links\n\nGoooood morning, loyal KSR readers. You're going to be in my hands for the rest of the day, so now is the time to get your best Ginger jokes in the comments section. As far as we can tell, outside of the Hoops for Haiti telethon, it should be a fairly uneventful day in the world of Kentucky Sports. But just because not much is happening, doesn't mean there is nothing to talk about. So to start us off, here are some morning links.\n\n-Speaking of the Telethon later today, Calipari has promised that some of his players will help man the phones, and that he plans to entertain some basketball royalty at the event. Frankly, you don't need me to tell you how great what Cal is doing here is. We will have more details about the event later today, as well as different ways you can donate to those in need.\n\n-Of course, calling into the telethon isn't the only way to get your jollies while doing something good for Haiti. If you're a famous NFL player, you can always challenge someone else to a footrace. Chad Ochocinco, not having any reason to run very hard over the next few weeks, has challenged Chris Johnson to a footrace where the loser pays his money straight to the relief effort. I seem to remember nothing coming from the Johnson/Rondo challenge, so hopefully this once comes through.\n\n-Friend of KSR, Gary Parish, writes that it may be time to question UNC's legitimacy as a top 25 team. While you have to take note of how hard of a schedule the Tar Heels have played, I don't think most people expected them to be 12-6 right now. And to think, we were once worried about losing the race to 2000.\n\n-You may have seen this already, you might not have. Heck, it may have already been posted on this blog. But the Wall Street Journal discusses a study that found that during your average NFL game, there is only 11 minutes of action. That is, the ball is only live for 11 minutes out of the close to three hours that every NFL game lasts. Personally, I would love it if someone started editing games from the past into eleven minute youtube clips.\n\n-In baseball news, one old guy gets mad at another one for tarnishing baseballs reputation. Seriously. Does anyone think baseball is a clean sport anymore? Does anyone really care that much? From here on out, I am assuming all baseball players are juicing, until someone like Babe Ruth becomes a major player again. Or BTI.\n\n-And in random sports news, Chinese Taipei, a country who has seen only very limited sports glory, fielded a team of amateurs in the World Cup of Poker. And they won. The team was made up of guys that had only been playing for two weeks. And they won. So next time Matt Jones tries to tell you how good he is at poker, just remember that you too, can be a world champion", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "72650a90-7f14-47ad-868d-f67adb08cd4f", "url": "https://www.on3.com/teams/kentucky-wildcats/news/sunday-morning-links-11/"}
{"text": "Outback Jack on In Your Head recap\n\nInYourHeadOnline.Com, the premier wrestling online radio program hosted by Jack and OneInchBiceps has 80'S WWF talent Outback Jack on the show. Outback Jack was known for his brief stint in WWF and his brief feud with Frenchy Martin and Killer Khan.\n\nIYH is the premier wrestling radio show, and has had Chris Jericho, Vince Russo, Mick Foley, and Awesome Kong amongst it's long list of guests.\n\nThe show starts off with the familiar IYH theme and we are off. Jack welcomes us to the show with his co-host, One Inch Biceps. The show starts off with a brief discussion of the movie, \"Signs\". Jacks brings up that the only wrestler he's ever had a poster of was Roddy Piper. OIB bings up Piper's confrontation with Santino, and Santino's recent DUI. Jack states that Santino is his favorite promo guy to date. Jack talks about TNA, and how they beat WWE Raw and Smackdown in the ratings in Australia.\n\nOIB brings up that Santino's booking photo makes it look like he is drunk. OIB brings up Piper's \"Designated Driver\" comment. Before break, Jack brings up the \"Wrestling is Real\", comment by the Great Khali. Jack compares The Great Khali to Hulk Hogan.\n\nThe IYH crew brings up the most recent WWE Raw, ECW, and Smackdown. Jack complains that Dreamer lost in the ECW 100TH show. Remember  is your home to great interviews with Homicide, Eric Bischoff, Jake Roberts, Harley Race, Juventud Guerrera and Orlando Jordan.\n\nJack welcomes Outback Jack to the show. Outback Jack confirms that Humpty Doo, is in fact a real place, and they have a population of 200. Caller Bryan Jones asks about Outback Jack's WWF tenure. Outback Jack tells a story of the Rougeau/Dynamite Kid confrontation, saying that Dynamite Kid deserved what he got. Outback Jack says that Dynamite Kid had a reputation for putting chemicals in wrestler's drinks. Outback Jack states that he learned from Les Thorton and Stu Hart. Outback Jack states that he got his job because WWF was touring Australia, and Arnold Skaaland liked his look. Outback Jack states that he refused to go down into the Hart Dungeon. Outback Jack gives his views on Stu Hart, and how people would warn him about his dungeon.\n\nA caller from Portugal calls in, and asks Outback Jack who helped him out and who tried to sabotage him in the WWF. Outback Jack states that Hillbilly Jim, JYD, and Hulk Hogan helped him out while Bobby Heenan treated him poorly. The caller asks about the state of Australian pro wrestler. Outback Jack answers that he no longer lives in Australia, but he heard that WWE opened up an office in Sydney. For the record, Outback Jack lives in Florida.\n\nOutback Jack informs us that Hilbilly Jim and himself were supposed to win the WWF Tag Team Championships, but the idea fell through. Jack asks if Outback Jack would've liked to play a heel, and Outback responds that he would've liked to and that heels are the more gifted wrestlers becuase they have to carry the match. Outback Jack has no ill will towards WWF, because they tried there hardest to get him over. Outback would've liked to play the foil to \"Skinner\" Steve Keirn. Regarding Vince, Outback states that his feeling towards him are confidential.\n\nAlthough Jesse Ventura used to call Outback Jack, Outhouse, Outback has no hard feeling towards Ventura and even considers him a friend. One Inch Biceps asks a question regarding Killer Khan. Outback calls him a good guy, but was the laziest guy he's ever met. Outback Jack states that Steve Strong tried to intentionally beat him up in a ring, but after the match he beat up Strong. Regarding the travel in the 80's WWF, Outback states that the travel wasn't bad, but he took various chemicals to help him cope. Outback Jack admits that he used steroids. He goes into a lengthy discussion about the affect of steroids and whether they should be illegal. Outback says that he is a conservative, but believes marijuana should be legal.\n\nOne Inch Biceps asks if he was ever approached about a WWF Legends Contract. Outback says that no he hasn't, but he did have a good selling doll when he was in WWF. Jack states that guys call their doll-action figures.\n\nOutback says that he was the first ever person that Ted Dibiase put the hundred dollar bill in their mouth. Outback states that Dibiase wanted it back after the match, but he refused. Outback says that while Dibiase was hated as a heel, he was an absolute gentlemen.\n\nOutback Jack says he left WWF when he got a TV Show called \"This is Adventure with Outback Jack\". At the time he left he still felt loyal to the WWF, and didn't try and go to WCW. Outback Jack says that he owns the rights to the Outback Jack character. Jack brings up The Bushwackers, and Outback Jack calls them great guys. Outback Jack states that he used to compete in strong man competitions. Outback Jack is blind in one eye, due to a helicopter crash. He is also half blind in the other, due to diabetes.\n\nA listener in the chat room asks about Outback's feeling about the Outback Steakhouse. Outback Jack says that he is a fan of the restaurant. Jack asks about Outback's Boomerang finisher. Outback states that Arnold Skaaland and Jay Strongbow came up with the idea of the finisher.\n\nRegarding Frenchy Martin, Outback Jack states he was a stand up guy, and he had fun wrestling him all around the world. Outback Jack says that the weirdest guy he's ever wrestled was The Ultimate Warrior. Outback Jack thanks the fans for cheering him during his tenure. Jack brings up Outback Jack's match against Iron Mike Sharpe at Wrestlemania 3. Outback says he had fun wrestling him, and he would be sore after matches with him.

And with that the interview is over.\n\nRemember, if you want to listen to entertaining interviews with such stars as Percy Pringle, Bill Goldberg, Tully Blanchard, Alex Shelley, ODB, and Gary Hart just go to \n\nAfter the interview Jack found that Bushwacker Butch is opening a wrestling school in New Zealand. The hosts talk about the WWE wanting a multi-cultural group of giants. They talk about Nathan Jones, and if he was wrestling in the 80's he could of been huge. They then talk about Heidenreich's clip of him thrusting behind Michael Cole that was aired on Raw a few weeks ago.\n\nThe hosts bring up the state of the WWE announcers. OIB and Jack disagree about Michael Cole. Jack, who is a huge fan of Mike Adamle thinks he will be the new Gordon Solie. Jack also states that the best play-by-play guys were former wrestlers. OIB says that he is de-sensitized to Tazz now that he is an announcer. Jack brings to light that he was never a fan of Gorilla Monsoon, even though he liked the pairing of Monsoon and Heenan. Jack says that Jim Ross knows how to make a moment seem legendary (the Austin stuff, Foley falling of the cage, and Flair's last match). OIB and Jack both agree that Tony Schiavone got a raw deal, and that the last year of WCW ruined his legacy. A caller calls in and threatens to hunt down Jimmy Jacobs for the way he's treated Lacy. OIB says that Jimmy Jacobs can't wrestle, and all he does is wear eye-liner and cries.\n\nRemember, if you want entertaining interviews with such stars as George South, King Kong Bundy, Mick Foley, Terry Funk listen to \n\nTo hear this interview and show in it's entirety please visit  and live every Wednesday at 8 PM EST including this week with Vampiro !!!\n\nJoin the interactive message board to leave questions for the guests at  and don't forget to subscribe to the pod cast at ", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "7f2ac48e-a59e-4909-844f-d4c3dc939749", "url": "https://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/outback-jack-on-in-your-head-recap/"}

{"text": "Recommended Posts\n\nWe're considering taking a Carowinds-Dollywood trip this May. If we were to go, we'd be at Carowinds on the 19th and 20th (Thursday and Friday). How busy would the park be on those days? Any others tips/advice for visiting the park?\n\nLink to comment\n\nShare on other sites\n\nCarowinds is rarely busy (with the exception of the water park) unless it's a Saturday. You'll be fine, the only large lines in the dry park will probably be for Nighthawk and Ricochet.\n\nI know I'm not the person who asked the question, but thanks for this info. This is good to know. I'm probably doing a Dollywood-Carowinds trip this year and hitting Carowinds on a Wednesday in early June.\n\nA team of scavengers scouring the globe for vintage thrill rides to bring back to Cedar Fair amusement parks in the United States hit the mother lode in Europe and plans to continue the search in Japan.\n\nThe transcontinental trek took Monty Jasper and a small crew of Cedar Fair maintenance coordinators to Scotland, Holland, Italy, Switzerland and Germany where they collected seven classic flat rides — industry-speak for spinning thrill rides that travel near the ground and/or rise up into the air.\n\n\"To be honest, I was surprised at all we found,\" said Jasper, a 42-year industry veteran and chief ride curator for Cedar Fair's chain of 11 amusement parks.\n\nIn all, Jasper spent $7 million — about $1 million per ride — on a Mondial Top Scan, Mack Music Express, Zierer Wave Swinger, Huss Condor, Huss Breakdance and a pair of Huss Troikas.\n\nAfter extensive rehabs, five of the rides are heading to Carowinds outside Charlotte, N.C., and the other two are on their way to Missouri's Worlds of Fun in time for the summer season.\n\nJasper likes the rides from the 1950s, '60s and '70s because they tend to be more robust and mechanically sound than their modern brethren.\n\n\"If you take care of them, they will last a long time,\" Jasper said.\n\nInspired by the \"American Pickers\" reality television show, Jasper's team of collectors departed for Europe with the goal of filling out Cedar Fair's portfolio of mid-range rides — those unheralded but essential workhorses that fall somewhere between the mega coasters and the kiddie rides. Jasper hoped to even pick up a sturdy old coaster if found one he liked.\n\nAt Scotland's Loudoun Castle theme park, which closed in 2010, the Cedar Fair ride pickers passed on a portable Schwarzkopf looping coaster but picked up a Troika, which is similar to the familiar Scrambler except it's suspended from overhead arms that tilt during the ride.\n\n\"They stuck the key in the ignition and it started right up,\" Jasper said. \"Troikas are stout rides. They're built like tanks.\"\n\nIn Germany, the pickers decided against a Funtime Star Flyer tower swing at Holiday Park but grabbed a Breakdance, which features a sloped spinning platform with hubs of cars that spin in the opposite direction. California's Great America, a Cedar Fair park in Santa Clara, has a Breakdance ride called Peanuts Pirates in its Planet Snoopy kiddie land.\n\nSwitzerland and Italy proved scenic but fruitless, with the pickers deciding against a Huss Top Scan and a Mack bobsled roller coaster.\n\n\"Anything can run again if you throw enough money at it, but it might not be worth it,\" Jasper said. \"You don't want to put some troublemaker into a park.\"\n\nCorroy Consulting, a ride-refurbishment factory in Holland that finds and resells classic flat rides, turned out to be a goldmine — with Jasper and the pickers snapping up five rides that will be stripped, repainted, repaired and updated with new electrical and lighting before being shipped to the United States.Worlds of Fun is expected to become home to the Dutch Troika as well as the Condor, a spinning tower ride with counter-spinning swinging gondola seats.\n\nThis month, Jasper plans to visit Japan on another scavenger hunt in hopes of discovering more rides like the ones he found in Europe while also looking for other classics like the Chance Trabant, Schwarzkopf Enterprise and Eli Bridge Scrambler.\n\n\"It may not be as good as that first trip,\" Jasper said. \"We will see.\"\n\nEdited February 6, 2016 by larrygator\n\nLink to comment\n\nShare on other sites\n\nI think the two are gonna be ready for WOF this season. The top scan at carowinds is still under fury so I dont think they will be ready at carowinds this year. That will be one HELLUVAH of a 2017 expansion!Link to comment\n\nShare on other sites\n\nCarowinds is really getting a significant investment. They were not playing when they said they wanted to make Carowinds the Cedar Point of the south. An investment like that in flat rides along with their other new rides coming to the park will help with capacity significantly.\n\nLink to comment\n\nShare on other sites\n\nI think this was already in plans. Right, the park has only 5 flat rides (outside of planet snoopy); a scrambler, a yo-yo, bumper cars, a 360 boat and an enterprise. To be a pretty big par, that's nothing to brag about lol..Now bro you know I'm a die hard for all flats and a screamin swing is one of them as well. The closest one to me is at Dollywood.

However it had not been until the Citizen Alleviation Action of 1997 was actually passed that people were actually permitted to keep particular precious metals, like gold, silver, platinum eagle and also palladium in their retirement accounts.\n\nHow To Invest In Real Gold\n\n3. What Types Of Retired Life Funds Get A Gold Individual Retirement Account Rollover?\n\nIRAs.\nYou can transfer any kind of existing Standard IRA, Roth IRA, SEP IRA, Basic Individual Retirement Account or Personal Directed individual retirement account to a gold individual retirement account.\n401( k) s.\nIf you have a non-active 401( k), meaning you no longer collaborate with the company that made it, you may perform a gold individual retirement account carry over. If you are over 59.5 years old and also have a current 401( k) with an existing company, you might be actually qualified for an \"in-service\" distribution, allowing you to perform a predisposed gold IRA rollover.\n403( b) s.\nA 403( b) plan is actually a retirement account used to workers of publicised colleges and tax obligation excused organizations. You can finish a roll-over with a 403( b) program after you have ended work. And sometimes, you can possibly do a limited gold individual retirement account move after you have actually turned 59.5 through an \"in-service\" distribution.\n457( b) s.\nA 457( b) plan is actually a pension supplied to condition and also town government workers, including law enforcement agents, firemens and various other civil servants. A gold IRA roll-over is only allowed along with 457( b) prepares the moment job is actually terminated or even in some cases at 70.5 years of age if still functioning.\nTSPs.\nSecond Hand Discount Programs are actually government-sponsored pension for Federal employees, such as civil servants as well as army.

Your opted for gold supplier is most likely to be licensed with numerous protectors for you to decide on. The majority of metals dealerships will certainly likewise help you to accomplish the documentation to guarantee a smooth move.\nMoving From A Traditional, Roth Or Even SEP INDIVIDUAL RETIREMENT ACCOUNT.\nIf you're moving funds coming from your present IRA to a brand new Self Directed account, you'll simply accomplish a move request type along with your brand new use. Your transfer demand form contains your existing individual retirement account's simple information, like the existing manager, your title, account number, and also the amount you are actually transferring.\nMoving funds between Individual retirement accounts are actually looked at a direct transfer since you never ever take possession of their funds.\nA direct move commonly takes between 10 and also 14 days.

The total rollover procedure can take in between 2 as well as 6 weeks.\nNote: The IRS simply allows one carry over (every account) in the course of 1 year. You are enabled endless custodian to protector transfers.\n5. Recognizing Taxes as well as Needed Lowest Distributions (RMDs).\nWhen you transfer your existing IRA to your new self-reliant account, it is actually certainly not a taxed celebration due to the fact that you are actually moving funds in between qualified, tax-deferred programs. The exact same policies apply if you do a rollover coming from a 401( k), 403( b), 457( b), or even TSP.\nJust how Do I Take Required Lowest Distributions Coming From My Brand-new Profile?\nAn RMD is actually the minimal quantity you must withdraw each year as soon as you've achieved 72. The previous limit was 70.5 but is actually currently 72 because of adjustments enacted in the Preparing Every Neighborhood Up for Retirement Life Enhancement (SECURE) Action.\nAll retirement accounts except Roths undergo RMDs.\nThe protector calculates RMDs by separating the previous year's account difference on December 31st through a circulation period from the IRS's \"Attire Life-time Table.\" As soon as you are actually 72 years old, your custodian will provide you with the minimum quantity you need to remove yearly.\nAside from a money RMD, you possess the alternative to take an \"in-kind\" distribution, whereas the depository will definitely ship your metallics to your house.\nWhen you request a cash circulation, most managers will definitely send ACH repayments free of charge as well as on any sort of timeline you decide on.

{"text": "— Vicadi cops 5th place, 'Tony Cuttz' 7th\n\nBy Rehana Ahamad\n\nDURING the Christmas season, there were three Chutney/Soca songs that dominated the local airwaves, and festive spaces; these pieces provided us with the perfect amount of hype and vibrancy needed for us to culminate a year as eventful as 2020.\nEven better, is the fact that these pieces were all done by incredibly talented Guyanese artistes; we know them as Vanita Willie, Tony Cuttz and Vicadi Singh. Their songs, 'Poowah' by Willie, 'Johnny Walker' by Tony Cuttz, and 'Never Gonna Leave' by Singh, have racked up brilliant reviews locally, regionally and far beyond. The trio, backed the exceptionally versatile Shakti Strings Band, and more specifically, their producer – keyboard whiz himself, Avinash Roopchand, were encouraged to break the almost 10-year hiatus and enter the 26th edition of the Chutney/Soca Monarch competition hosted in Trinidad and Tobago; the finals were hosted virtually on Sunday night, and thousands were logged on throughout the almost five-hour-long competition.\n\nVicadi Singh poses with his team\n\nThe Guyanese artistes were among the lasts to perform at the Southex-sponsored virtual activity, and their performances were colourful, pulsating and created quite a stir in the comments section of the LIVE-feeds on social media. However, none of the Guyanese who participated won the competition as many of us had hoped.\nIn the Queen aspect of the competition, Vanita Willie swung her waist to the first runner up position; Vicadi Singh dished out a serving of his 'silky smooth' vocals to be awarded fifth position, while Tony Cuttz mesmerised and energised the virtual audiences and was tied in seventh place with Trinidad's Adesh Samaroo. Many were also hopeful that overseas-based Guyanese, Joel 'Prince JP' Pharous would have placed, having executed a wonderful performance of his latest song, \"It's Over\".\n\nThe artistes pose with members of the Shakti Strings Band, along with local Coordinator, WR Reaz\n\nThe activity also provided an ideal forum for the Berbice Delight Dancers – two-time Chutney Dance Competition winners, led by Valerie Barran.\n\nTony Cuttz, moments before his scintillating performance of 'Johnny Walker'\n\nThe artistes have all took to their Facebook Page to express gratitude to their producers, sponsors, and WR Reaz, Coordinator of the Guyana leg of the competition. Reaz told the Guyana Chronicle that Guyana was well-represented on the big stage, and that the artistes have all made their sponsors and Team 592 quite proud. He reminded too that competitions often attract high emotions, particularly as it relates to those who may disagree with the results. \"I understand people may share different opinions but in the end [we have to] let the music do the talking,\" Reaz said.\n\nHe had previously indicated that public voting would play a key role in deciding who would win the competition. Nonetheless, the promoter said he was pleased with the activity, and believes that the Guyanese who competed have a far way to go in the music industry.\n\"This is really a stepping stone to move forward and build on the genre of Chutney/Soca music in Guyana,\" Reaz said.\nHe expressed gratitude for the support given to the team by the Shakti Strings Band, Team MMR, Envy Sounds, E-Networks, Abee Chunes Radio, Onsa Entertainment, RRT Enterprise, Jumbo Jet, NMCRA Connector Realty our of Queens New York, as well as Adana Homes and Satishwar Persaud from Canada.", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "913bd34e-7581-43a1-aadb-0b136b98c7bd", "url": "https://guyanachronicle.com/2021/02/15/vanita-willie-is-first-runner-up-chutney-queen/"}

By employing an expert, you have plants trimmed at the optimum time for their types. (Hydrangea are a best example of a plant that must be kept by specialists or enthusiastic garden enthusiasts.) Trimming is done to maintain shape or dimension, eliminate invested blooms, eliminate dead/diseased arm or legs, as well as to promote development. Hedging is usually forming certain to your plants and also dirt. You'll also get illness and also pest prevention for the common problems to stop them from happening.

Weather patterns and also watering affect turf, so those things should be taken into consideration together with your turf program. Additional applications are sometimes needed during super-wet years to manage wetness related problems.\n\nIrrigation Setup\n\nWatering start-up and shut-down are included in most maintenance agreements. Although everybody starts up their watering system in the spring (when they have one,) not everybody has their system winterized. By not having actually the water blown out of the lines, the water can freeze and increase during cool temperature levels creating damage to their system. The damage is often extra costly than simply keeping the system and having it winterized correctly. Some agreements likewise include a month-to-month check-in for optimum usage/water efficiency. High Savanna's agreements do include this pro-active action. By keeping track of, we can adjust for optimum plant health and observe any kind of repair services that might need done.\n\nMulching in Bear\n\nMulching is normally done one or two times a year relying on the agreement.

Some clients only want a couple of a year. Those clients will certainly have leaf build-up between brows through because their carrier only comes twice. Some clients favor as much as 7 removals a season so that their residential or commercial property stays rather clean all loss.

{"text": "500.2 - Indirect Cost\n\nUniversity Group Policy #500.2\n\nI. Policy Statement\n\nWinston-Salem State University (WSSU) receives reimbursement of Facilities and Administrative (F&A) costs related to grants and contracts and will allocate these funds in accordance with all applicable federal guidelines, federal and state laws, and policies of The University of North Carolina, as they may be amended from time to time. The Chancellor shall expend F&A funds only to support scholarly development of its faculty, staff, and students or to ensure that the campus infrastructure is supported to enhance such scholarly activities.\n\nII. Guidelines\n\nRecovery of Indirect (F&A) Costs\n\nUnless restricted by the sponsor, all grant and contract proposal budgets submitted for external funding shall incorporate the full prevailing negotiated F&A rate or the approved university rate for a class of sponsors (e.g. corporate sponsors, state government, school districts, etc.).\n\nWhen the sponsor limits or prohibits the full recovery of F&A costs, the Principal Investigator must provide a statement from the sponsor concerning the restriction when submitting the proposal for internal review and approval. This statement may be a copy of the applicable policy from the sponsor's website, request for proposal, grant guidelines, or other documents, or a written statement received directly from the sponsor when no other statement of its policy is available. If the sponsor permits the recovery of F&A costs but does not specify a rate, the Principal Investigator must contact the Office of Sponsored Programs to determine the applicable rate.\n\nWhen the Principal Investigator wishes to waive part or all of the full amount of F&A costs that could be recovered, the Principal Investigator must provide a written statement justifying the waiver during the pre-award stage when submitting the proposal for internal review and approval, and this statement must be signed by the Chief Research Officer or Associate Provost of Research ). Any approved waived amounts should be included in the budget in the in-kind cost-sharing column.\n\nDistributions of Indirect (F&A) Costs\n\nF&A costs (sometimes called indirect or overhead receipts) are calculated for such items as facilities maintenance and renewal, libraries, salaries of technical, compliance and administrative personnel, equipment, scholarly development, and facilities support. F&A rates are set by negotiations between the federal government and each university. Lower rates are often established statutorily or by policy by certain programs and sponsors.\n\nUnder 2 CFR 200, Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards Uniform Guidance, indirect costs generally reimburse for costs of the grants and contracts operations of the institution and other overhead expenses of the university in a manner consistent with the formulae under which the funds were recovered. The university will institute controls pertaining to the compliance requirements for sponsored project expenditures under 2 CFR 200, Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards.\n\nThe distribution of a certain percentage of F&A costs may be recovered from external grants to those units and investigators, college/schools, departments, and faculty members. Funds will be distributed to each principal investigator (PI), the PI's home department, the PI's home college/ school/division, the Office of Sponsored Programs, and WSSU administration (Finance & Administration and the Office of the Provost). Indirect cost funds that are earmarked to support the research infrastructure will be allocated to separate accounts based on the indirect cost revenue recovered in the previous fiscal year from sponsored program accounts. Funds will be distributed by October 1, annually.\n\nWinston-Salem State University has elected to invest a portion of its recovered F&A costs in the support and stimulation of research and scholarly activities. The total amount for distribution of these funds shall be determined on an annual basis at the discretion of the Associate Provost of Research. Consequently, at the beginning of each fiscal year, the Office of Contracts and Grants will transfer the approved amount of recovered F&A funds from the prior fiscal year from the general fund to designated accounts. The distribution formula for F&A funds is outlined in the table below. The funds available for distribution each year may change, since the amounts generated change and any distribution is always at the discretion of the Associate Provost of Research, but the distribution formula will remain as outlined in the table until additional changes are approved by the Board of Trustees.\n\nThe cost for operating the project should be charged directly to the grant as direct costs. These direct cost charges may include a percentage of the PI's salary as well as support for postdoctoral associates, consultants, graduate and/or undergraduate assistants, equipment needed for the research, travel, subject payment fees, and other charges directly relating to conducting the project. Under no conditions should a PI receive any monetary compensation for salary or contractual services from indirect cost dollars that are placed in the PI's indirect cost account.\n\nFive categories of accounts are listed in the distribution table below. Administrative support for Finance and Administration (20%), the Provost (10%), and the Office of Sponsored Programs (35%) are included to support infrastructure needs relating to sponsored research activities. Funds allocated to Finance and Administration may include payment for leased space, administrative costs for maintaining facilities, providing security, and other services. Funds allocated to the Provost may be used to support administrative costs for scholarly activities, in-kind costs for grant recipients, award recognition, travel, equipment, etc. Funds allocated to the Office of Sponsored Programs (OSP) may be used to support the mission of OSP to provide technical assistance to faculty and staff in obtaining external funds to engage in scholarly activities which may include but is not limited to grant writing workshop travel, federal agency program officer meetings, internally reviewed applications for pilot study funding, patent application fees, patent application maintenance fees, research/technology transfer fees, professional development costs for OSP personnel, and annual award recognition.\n\nIndirect Cost Distribution Formula\n\nArea\n\n% Allocation\n\nAdministration\n\nVice Chancellor for Finance and Administration (20%)\n\nProvost (10%)\n\nOffice of Sponsored Programs (35%)\n\n65%\n\nAcademic Units\n\nAdministrators [Deans] (10%)\n\nChairs/Directors/Supervisors (10%)\n\nPrincipal Investigators (10%)\n\n30%\n\nInstitutional Reserves\n\n5%\n\nTotals\n\n100%\n\nEligible principal investigators (PIs) will receive 10% of overhead receipts. In order to establish a research incentive account (RIA), the amount of receipts to be posted must be at least $500. In the event that a PI has several sponsored research activities, the total amount of overhead receipts generated from all accounts will be considered and the total amount of receipts to be posted to the PI's research incentive account must be at least $500. To reduce administrative costs, returns of less than $500 will be allocated to the PIs departmental unit.\n\nIf faculty members from more than one department are involved in a project, the lead PI and the department of the lead PI will have accounts established. Faculty members are encouraged to determine how indirect costs will be used to support the project prior to submission of the proposal.\n\nIn the event that a new PI is assigned to a sponsored program during a fiscal year, the receipts from that year will be assigned to the new PI. Each individual is responsible for completing paperwork to establish a new fund account, as well as managing his or her account in collaboration with the accounting office. In the event that a PI overspends grant funds, the difference needed to balance the account will be taken from the PI's research incentive account and, if needed, the department's account through the level of the dean/director. The funds in the account may be used, for example, to support the following: travel, equipment, supplies, student research training, administrative costs not covered by the award, temporary staff, etc.\n\nThe department of the PI (e.g., the PI's department chair or center director) will receive 10% of overhead receipts. These funds may be used, for example, to support travel, equipment, supplies, student support to conduct research, administrative costs not covered by the award, recognition awards and meetings, professional development for faculty, non-sponsored research support, etc.)\n\nThe department of the PI's immediate supervisor (e.g., deans or heads of administrative units) will receive 10% of overhead receipts. These funds may be used to support travel, equipment, supplies, student support to conduct research, administrative costs not covered by the award, recognition awards and meetings, professional development for faculty, etc.\n\nReserves (5%) will be kept on hand and monitored by Finance & Administration to cover overspending of budgets.\n\nIII. Roles and Responsibilities\n\nDistribution of Receipts\n\nThe Office of Sponsored Programs along with the Office of Grants and Contracts will be responsible for determining the total amount of funds associated with sponsored research that can be recovered from indirect costs from the previous fiscal year. The Office of Contracts and Grants will determine the amount of overhead receipts to be distributed per the percentages in the included table and the eligibility of the recipients at the end of each fiscal year. By October 15th of each year, account recipients will be notified that they are eligible to establish accounts and will be required to submit the request for a New Banner Fund Form; and a Budget Create Form. In the case of a Primary Investigator's exit from the university, remaining IDC funds from their incentive account or pending distribution will be absorbed to the University Reserves.\n\nRecipients who already have an established incentive account will have newly generated funds deposited to their previously established account Overhead funds that remain at the end of a fiscal year in individual accounts will be carried forward. These funds are to be managed by the account holder and the supervisor of the account holder.\n\nIV. Applicability\n\nThis policy applies to the faculty, staff, and students engaged in scholarly activity.", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "84037458-4655-4642-98ad-e20b6731f879", "url": "https://www.wssu.edu/about/offices-and-departments/legal-affairs/policies-and-procedures/chapter-500-finance-and-audit/500.2.html"}

{"text": "Sunday, December 11, 2016\n\nDecember 10, 2016 - First Treatments\n\nI have been using third person as I describe the ordeal, but\nI think it will be easier to describe what I am going through in first person\nfrom now on.\n\nIn the last post I had received my second opinion at UCSD\nthat was essentially the same as the doctors at Scripps. Both prescribed the same treatment: Lupron hormone blocker (also termed\n\"Androgen Deprivation Therapy\") combined with Dosetaxel chemo for 6\ntreatments over 18 months. Neither\norganizations offer the addition of natural remedies to augment the administering\nof the drugs.\n\nI have made the choice to continue treatment with Scripps\ninstead of switching to UCSD, largely for the reasons I gave in the last blog: (1) I find Dr. Bhangoo, the Scripps\noncologist, to be incredibly responsive to ex-appointment questions and\nconcerns, and willing to make himself available to me, (2) Dr. Bhangoo has\ndemonstrated a willingness to do some research into less traditional treatments\nto augment the standard treatment he and Dr. Testy have prescribed, (3) the\nScripps location for infusion of the chemo is much, much more convenient.\n\nI did receive some good news from Dr. Bhangoo. He had read about a new test by Quest that\nattempts to detect and measure metastasized cells in the blood. Outside the normal diagnostics, he ordered\nthis test for me. The test showed no\nmetastasized cells in my blood. This\nwould lead one to believe that this enhances the chances for a successful\noutcome.\n\nAs I have read more and more about the Lupron/Dosetaxel\nregimen, I am struck by how Draconian it is.\nIt is a total shotgun approach; one size fits all. Starve the feed mechanism (testosterone) and\nkill all the fast-dividing cells in the body with the hope that we get the\ncancer cells. In the meantime the\npatient has all kinds of nasty side effects and in some ways is left with no\nimmune system to continue to fight the cancer if it hasn't been\neliminated. The only good news is that\nin spite of this, patient outcomes have been found to be better than treatment\nwith hormone blockers like Lupron and no chemo.\n\nIncidentally, scratch that idea in my last post that this\nchemo is different from others. It is,\nbut Dosetaxel is the same stuff that is used to treat breast cancer, so from\nthat I know that it does cause nausea, lack of appetite, and mood changes, to\nmention a few. It is less intrusive than\nwhat they use for leukemia, but nevertheless still nasty.\n\nIt is important to note that hormone blocking is almost\nalways the prescribed starting point for this disease. Most all other treatments (like immunotherapy\nor radioactive drugs) are only applied if the cancer fails to be stopped by\neliminating testosterone. For this\nreason there are few if any studies that skip the Lupron step.\n\nI am planning to continue taking Modified Citrus Pectin\nduring chemo. As I described on 12/3 I\nam getting very positive results from my Saw Palmetto/Stinging Nettle\nRoot/Modified Citrus Pectin/Low Sugar Diet regimen. MCP in particular seems to cause the body to\nintensify its attack in the process of causing cancer cells to commit\nsuicide. It has also been found to\ncounteract some cancer's natural resistance to chemo, so the $120/month for MCP\nmay just be worth it. It just may\nincrease the odds of getting all of\nthe cancer. The only concern is the\npossibility that MCP might lessen the impact of Dosetaxel. I have been searching for papers on this.\n\nI don't think I will continue on the Saw Palmetto and\nStinging Nettle Root since they generally have the same effect as Lupron and I\ndon't want to mess around while going through the chemo treatments.\n\nIt has been 3+ days since the Lupron shot. I feel no side effects yet. I start the Dosetaxel in two days and have to\ntake a steroid first to counteract some of the Dosetaxel side effects.", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "e9f35861-550b-4e5a-b38a-424ad9b193e2", "url": "https://leshascancer.blogspot.com/2016/12/december-10-2016-first-treatments.html"}

{"text": "With five youngsters and her beau in tow, the Estranged Wife and I reflect on what we pulled from our wreckage\n\nRegular readers will know that this column is a merry-go-round, in which the same horses come into view again and again: I'm broke, I'm bored, I'm not getting laid. Sometimes new horses appear, such as: I'm freezing my balls off, or that train journey was a pain in the backside. To return to that last nag prematurely: last week a man got into the final spare seat of the Quiet Coach at York and announced to the woman sitting next to him, but loudly enough for most of the carriage to hear, that he had intended to go to Doncaster but had got on the wrong train.\n\nHe popped open a can of Stella and told us his life story, which included the details that this was not the first time he had made this mistake, that he was from Hull, had voted for Brexit, and scorned the notion that people like him \"didn't know what we were voting for\". It struck me that the fate of the nation hangs on the opinion of someone who is, by his own admission, not competent enough to read a departure board, but I forbore to mention this. I also forbore to repeat my bravery of two weeks ago, when I asked a couple in the same carriage to bear in mind what the word \"quiet\" meant. I didn't interrupt this man because he was drinking a beer that in some circles is called \"wife-beater\", which could, by extension, become \"passenger-beater\". But that's enough about Quiet Coaches for a while.\n\nAnyway, I was – am, until tomorrow morning – back down in London for a couple of reasons, one of which was to have dinner with my youngest son, his girlfriend and two of their friends, who are off on a post-mocks trip to Paris. Now the youngest, like his siblings, has, over the years, told his friends stories about me, as a result of which I am considered an object of some fascination, and far removed from the experience of their own fathers. Their fathers do not get caught at Luton airport, embarking on a family holiday, with an accidentally-trousered half-ounce of excellent marijuana, and get away with it. Their fathers do not call a miserable, sub-Fawlty chip shop owner in Lynmouth \"a miserable old c—\" after exceptionally poor service (and food. Note, this chip shop is not the Esplanade Fish Bar, which was voted North Devon's favourite chip shop in 2010, and deservedly so). Their fathers do not live in a Hovel and play with air rifles with them. Their fathers do not… well, you get the idea. And yes, the fate of the nation hangs on the opinion of this fool, too.\n\nThe last time I was scheduled to meet the youngest one's friends I was unable to, and he was really cross with me. At first I found this hard to believe, but the kids do appear to have an affection for their old man and relish his eccentricities – or \"failings\", as they're more commonly known. (By coincidence, I've just received an email from a publicist whose headline is, \"Discover novel inspired by childhood trauma ahead of Children of Alcoholics Week.\")\n\nSo I found myself one evening in Shepherd's Bush, at the family table, with five youngsters (my daughter joined us; the other sibling is in Manchester), the mother of my children and her beau. As I sat down to dinner I thought I'd better start embarrassing my son in front of his girlfriend by saying, \"I think it's about time we had The Talk.\"\n\nContent from our partners\n\n\"What kind of weapon,\" asked the quizmaster, \"is a da-ringa?\" A what? I asked myself, until I worked it out. I turned and said, summoning up all my dad powers of embarrassment, \"I think you'll find it's pronounced derringer.\" (A small pistol.)\n\nWere my children embarrassed? Not a bit of it, or if they were, they hid it well. It's funny, though, how one doesn't think of one's own children as young, but when they are in the company of their peers, you think to yourself: \"My God, they're twelve.\" But they're not. They are still forming themselves, but the job is nearly done – a little soft round the edges, although the youngest's girlfriend seems considerably more self-possessed than I was at her age. (Translation: she doesn't seem scared enough of me.)\n\nThe next day I got a sweet text from the Estranged Wife, saying what a lovely evening it had been, and how pleased that \"somehow we pulled a lot out of the wreckage\".

I was worried that I would be a terrible father.\n\n\"You were!!!\" she replied, \"but they love you so that's all good.\"\n\nWhich is a double-edged thing to say, but I shall concentrate on the second half of it as I sit in the Quiet Coach tomorrow, listening to someone recite their autobiography for 500 miles.

Since it has been so long since I have listened to one of her books, I bit the bullet and got this one.\n\nI'm really glad I did. It is a slightly differnt path than she normally goes down, but I would have to say this was probably my favorite of all of her books - although I still want Rosato & Associates to come back soon!\n\nOn the best seller list?\n\nOh my goodness. How did I get fooled into buying this book? I read some rave reviews here and saw that it was on a best seller list. My advice: if you like suspense or mystery, witty dialogue, interesting characters....this book is NOT for you. It is sappy like a romance novel and has an exceptionally slow moving story line.\n\nLiterary License unchained\n\nThis 3-star book received an extra star because I am the father of an adopted daughter and my belief is that all adoptive parents harbor a degree of fear that an unknown legality could someday take their child from them. I think this book suffered because author Scottoline had to create too many implausible scenarios to allow for the outcomes she had in mind. For example, the husband of Ellen's adoption attorney was overly cooperative; Ellen's babysitter seemed to be available 24/7; the coincidental sighting of major characters at the Miami airport; the Missing Child card that set the whole story in motion in the first place etc. The published summary for the book already mentions a \"happy ending\" and knowing this shouldn't bother most listeners. It shouldn't be hard for most listeners to figure out how this happy ending will play out. At least it wasn't for me. Masterson did an adequate job with the narration, although her depiction of Lisa's son was especially grating. The book raises some ethical questions although the manner in which they were raised was not very believable. But, hey, it's fiction and if reality was key to enjoyable reading and listening, then there would be far fewer books being sold.\n\nPredictable plot, sappy dialogue\n\nI had not read a book by this author before, nor had I heard anything by this narrator.\n\nThe plot is, as said elsewhere, very predictable and contrived. There is lots (I mean LOTS) of sappy dialogue between the main character and her son and the main character and her love interest. The narrator should give up imitating little boys and Brazilian Romeos. The little boy sounded like ..well, hard to describe but the attempt was \"piping\" and the result was bad acting. The Brazilian Romeo was made to talk like a Transylvanian count or something...\n\nI could have stood being irritated by the narrator had the plot had any originality or pazzaz but imho, it did not.\n\nA could-have-been-great novel\n\nCAUTION: SEMI SPOILER. A compelling story, wonderfully human and believably suspenseful - to a point. It falls apart when the author begins to justify the trite ending by turning the child's biological parents into villains. I thought Scottaline was going to challenge herself, her heroine, and the other adults involved to find a humane and loving solution; that might have been unrealistic but not nearly so much as the contrived happily-ever-after. Worthwhile entertainment that ultimately disappoints.", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "6f89a1f8-a5dc-45f5-9c1e-5582aae819db", "url": "https://www.audible.ca.cdn.amazon.com/pd/Look-Again-Audiobook/B002V0Q0II"}

Things are complicated by the fact that Stacy had been seeing another man, Gary Detweiller, and he's the one she suspects of having stolen the watch. With a little detective work, Charlie and her sidekick dog, Rusty, retrieve the missing watch and all should be well. But three days later, Detweiller is murdered. All eyes turn to Stacy as the prime suspect.\n\nOnce again, Stacy begs Charlie's help in proving her innocence. As she begins to ask questions, Charlie learns that Detweiller's life was not as simple as first perceived and that any number of people had grievances against him. And before she can pinpoint the killer, her own life is in danger as well.\n\nSomething is lurking in the cold, black waters surrounding Mossley Island. An arcane and eldritch horror. Hungry. Craving the flesh – and perhaps the very souls – of all who live there.\n\nFor fifty years it's waited. As those who so valiantly defended the island against its last invasion have succumbed to age. Died off. Allowing it to fade from secret history into half-forgotten myth.\n\nNow It's mounting a new attack. It wants the island and this time… Its evil intentions will not be denied.\n\nThe first eerie chapter in a suspense-filled seven-part serial of buried secrets, dark places and the occult follows Dawn, a teenager from the mainland, as she accompanies her wayward father back to his hometown and the family he abandoned before she was born.\n\nHoping to understand where she comes from, Dawn gets more than she bargained for as she begins to uncover the island's secret societies, a dark conspiracy that may endanger all of mankind, and her own shocking blood destiny.

{"text": "The Sarann, Koh Samui\n\nThe Sarann occupies a stretch of land along the ocean with a beautiful view of one of the beaches for which Koh Samui is so well known. The main town is about 20 minutes away and a complimentary shuttle is available at certain times to take you there. We immediately noticed the uniform of the staff – their striped tshirts, khaki board shorts and white tennis shoes were reminiscent of yacht attire and were much more laid back than the traditional outfits worn at other five star accommodations in Thailand. They fit the atmosphere which was inviting and upscale.\n\nThe Rooms\n\nOur Jacuzzi Villa was very comfortable and private. The huge bathroom had a spacious rain shower, round tub and separate water closet. The small courtyard area was equipped with lounge chairs and the jacuzzi tub. Our king bed was really comfortable as were the chairs and benches in the room. The large desk as a headboard is a clever use of space, keeping it hidden from those who won't use it and easily accessible for those who will.\n\nThe villas are arranged in rows, so to get a view of the ocean and to be furthest from the road, stay in the ocean view pool villas. Each has a separate living room and private infinity pool. If you can, avoid a room on the row closest to the road where you'll hear the traffic.\n\nThe Grounds\n\nThe grounds are small, but beautiful and the restaurant and infinity pool have spectacular views. The area is quiet secluded. The villas are fairly close together separated by sidewalks, so there isn't much area to truly explore, but if you are looking to lounge on the beach or venture into town, it is a wonderful location.\n\nThe Food\n\nWild Ginger, the resort's restaurant, serves breakfast, lunch and dinner on two levels of outdoor patio. The lower level sits right on the seawall. The tables are lit up with candles and lanterns at night accompanied by the soothing sound of the waves crashing over the rocks below.\n\nUnfortunately, the food doesn't live up to the spectacular setting. The tuna on my Nicoise salad was painfully overdone, as was the grilled salmon at dinner. The rack of lamb (also overcooked) was served with the same boring potatoes available at the buffet breakfast. There just wasn't much going on in any of the dishes and it seemed the only spice the chef had to work with was salt. The best thing we tried was the chicken burger and fries.\n\nBreakfast was a typical buffet with healthy options, meats and cheeses, an egg station and boiled rice soup station. There was also a large selection of pastries to choose from. The service was best at breakfast and we enjoyed eating in the shade with the morning breeze.\n\nFor similar menus at about the same price and to eat at a table in the sand, walk through the restaurant onto the beach. There are four or five restaurants along there that seemed to be open all day. We tried the one next door, Buco, and were much more pleased.\n\nThe Spa\n\nThe spa is located in the last row next between guest villas. The staff were friendly and welcoming and the waiting area was relaxing and calm. The building itself was not the most breathtaking spa we've ever seen, but the treatment, which is what really matters, was great. Our post-session tea was taken right next to the check-in desk, which wasn't the most serene set up, but overall we greatly enjoyed our visit.\n\nStay here for amazing sunsets, a small but beautiful infinity pool and access to a quiet stretch of beach with a few dining options nearby. The convenience of this location was a major plus, especially with the shuttle that takes you right into town. To get the best experience at The Sarann, book a villa with a view of the ocean.\n\nQuick Tips:\n\nEasy access to a quiet, clean beach\n\nDining options on site are ok, but several more options are just a short walk down the beach\n\nA regular shuttle takes guests into town\n\nDon't miss the sunset by the infinity pool or a candlelit dinner on the lower deck of the restaurant!dennistraveler2\n\nLove Thailand! Haven't been for many years but I'm hoping to make it back sometime in the not too distant future. This place looks absolutely gorgeous! I might have to fast track my next vacation so I can stay here asap!

{"text": "Doctor Harleen Quinzel continues her study of the patients of Arkham, but her interviews are proving less than helpful for her study into the minds of Sociopaths and Psycho's. However, there is one patient that has peaked her interest, more so than she likes to admit. Though she tries to fight the urge to see him, to see Mr. Jay, she cannot help herself.\n\nThis book is a romantic story unlike any other (to my knowledge). It's a twisted take of how Harleen grows to love Joker despite all her efforts to fight the feelings she holds for him which includes pity. Her interest in him becomes and obsession, as she even finds herself watching him sleep in his cell at night, but she soon realises that her increasing compassion for him isn't entirely simple chemistry. It is the city of Gotham that pushes her own psyche over the edge. A city full of monsters, though they are not the monsters that are kept behind bars….they are the monsters roaming the streets as free men and women.\n\nBook one concentrated heavily on Harleen alone, but book two takes a look at the rest of Gotham as we get to see Harvey Dent get acid thrown at him, which put him into a coma, and in his absence, a group of masked men execute Sal Maroni, the crime boss who threw the acid at Dent, in order to make a point about how they are dishing out the justice that the GCPD and even Batman won't give because of the line they refuse to cross.\n\nSeeing these events on the news, is what pushes Harleen closer to becoming the character we all know her as today, because despite how she used to feel about these sort of stories, she realises that her time with the Joker has effected her way of thinking. As the story continues, Harleen becomes more infatuated with Mr. Jay and the panels show exactly just how it happens.\n\nAs with the first book, this addition to the story gives us a closer look at Harleen's dream sequences, her thought processes, her every emotion and how she tries to fight them. We get to see her interact with some of Gotham's familiar faces such as Commissioner Gordon, Harvey Dent, even Batman himself, as she tries to find the answers she's so desperately looking for. However, as she continues her journey, her study, she realises that perhaps the Joker isn't so mad after all, and perhaps he sees the world as it truly is, but she'll be damned if she's going to admit it.\n\nJoker feels very different in this story compared to his many other iterations in the comics, film, television shows and video games. With the exception of one or two moments where he feels familiarly eccentric, the majority of the time he's with Harleen, he seems calm, and very soft. He had his moments in book one where he was the Joker we all know, but in book two, he feels less like a villain, and more like a lost soul, who hides his feelings deep down, forcing himself to feel numb until the beautiful woman comes along, and he finally finds someone to connect with. You almost feel sorry for him, which already caused controversy within the his latest adaptation in film with Joaquin Phoenix's portrayal of the character in Joker, and much like the film, this book allows this character, who we all know to be a psychotic murderer, to tug at your heartstrings. Maybe it's our emotion towards him alone, or perhaps it's because of his connection to Harleen, who we are already connected to ourselves on a deeper level than we thought we could be from previous iterations of her character, but either way, as a reader, you want to help Joker yourself when you read this book, and you want him to open up about himself.\n\nStjepan Šejić has created something truly beautiful for the DC Black Label line of releases, as Harleen takes a character we thought we knew, and truly bring out a side to her we have never really seen. His art is beautiful and each character looks and feels more human than what we see in most comic book art. Šejić's art is not only beautiful but it's very unique, as I have never seen comics drawn in this style before but certainly hope to see more of it in the DC Comics universe, because there is something both appealing and unsettling about how realistic the characters appear, making them almost human, as though He was sat in the room with them as they spoke to one another. Šejić is a very talented individual who has brought us a twisted tale of romance.\n\nOverall this book has easily become one of my favourites already, for it is a disturbing, yet beautiful love story unlike any other, which delves deep into the psyche of the titular character, but more than that, it also adapts the world around her, so that whilst we focus on one character, we also get to see what the rest of the world is doing, and still managing to tie it in to her story. I cannot wait for the third and final book, to see how her journey wraps up, no doubt with her becoming Harley Quinn as we all well know by now, but with Šejić's writing, it will be a truly magnificent read.", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "ffac465e-7139-4611-b832-716c354b2cca", "url": "https://mediamallrat.com/2019/11/02/harleen-book-two/"}

{"text": "Anchor – Stanford University Athletics\n\nIn fact, the \"promise\" is a bit strong. There was some mystery. And there's the question of logistics, how about having a Stanford Krauter, halfway around the world away from the virtual pup.\n\nBut the way Krauter understands it, there's a dog on the way.\n\n\"Sometimes my parents make funny bets with me…If you do this, it will happen,\" said Krauter, chief international relations officer and cardinal golfer. \"Like, if I'm in the top 50 in the world, we'll get a dog.\"\n\nIt's been nearly two years since Aline topped the top 50 amateur rankings in the world – she's already reached number 24 – and she still has no puppy. The clock is ticking, Mr. and Mrs. Krauter.\n\nAs cute as a pup may be, the biggest point is Krauter's appearance. Krauter, a German national, arrived as a recruit on the road. But not only has she been a fixture in the squad since her first tournament, she has become indispensable to her performance and leadership. The Cardinals, the highest-ranked team in the country, might not be in a position to compete for the NCAA Championship without her. And that's no exaggeration in her role in keeping the ship on course as it prepares for the Nationals in Scottsdale, Arizona, starting Friday.\n\nPhoto by Cody Glenn / ISIphotos.com.\n\nstudent Rose Chang A sophomore student Rachel Heck It ranks first and third in the world, respectively, but it is no exaggeration to say that it is the Krauter who maintains the performance of the Cardinal golf machine.\n\n\"As a coach, I relied on Allen,\" he said. Ann WalkerMargot and Mitch Milias, director of the Stanford Ladies Golf Club. \"If I turned to Allen and said, Would you be able to talk about this?\" She is always ready to share her thoughts for the benefit of the whole group. Clear, concise, and always on point. \"\n\nDuring the NCAA Regionals last week, Walker tapped Krauter time and time again.\n\n\"Part of the reason is that it hits me so fast is that we are going to lose this wealth of knowledge and this rock in our program,\" Walker said. \"I want to use it as best we can go down the stretch.\"\n\nIn the team rally before the first round, Krauter felt the pressure of expectations to advance to the Nationals, especially at Stanford Golf Course.\n\n\"No matter what happens out there, enjoy your time and enjoy every second of our tremendous support system at Stanford,\" Krauter told her teammates. \"There are only so many times we play at home in front of a crowd. We cherish it, because it goes faster than you want it to.\"\n\nIn all honesty.\n\nkrauter and Calista Reyes They are the only adults on a very talented team, but they are also very young. Teammates call Allen, \"Grandma.\"\n\n* * *\n\nPhotography by Karen Hickey / ISIphotos.com.\n\n'Grandma' has grown up in Esslingen, a town in southwestern Germany with roots dating back more than 3,000 years.\n\nAllen and his older brother Tim attended Stuttgart International School, an English language immersion school with a multicultural environment. She speaks English without leaving a trace of the accent.\n\n\"I like to tell people that I've lost my accent at the border,\" she said. \"But I didn't really have one, so…\"\n\nAllen played golf for the first time at the age of six. In fact, this is not entirely true. I worked on wheels and played soccer – almost anything other than golf – when I accompanied Tim to the driving range.\n\n\"I just didn't have the patience for that, to be honest,\" Allen said.\n\nSlowly, that is starting to change.\n\n\"She saw how passionate I was about golf and started playing more by herself,\" Tim wrote in an email. \"The key is that she wasn't taking golf too seriously and was focused on having fun.\"\n\nWithout Tim, Allen might never have found the sport. She describes him as her mentor in the game, and the two remain good friends.\n\n\"To this day, he's still the one who creates that impulse inside me,\" she said.\n\nTim, who attended Cal Berkeley, lives in London now, but thinks nothing of flying across the Atlantic to carry Allen's bag in the amateur and pro tournaments.\n\nAt the age of twelve, Krauter played in her first major district tournament. By the age of fifteen, she was ready to devote herself to the game, and moved to Florida to attend Saddlebroke Preparatory School in Florida for golf and tennis.\n\nTim wrote: \"The decision was entirely Allen, and my parents didn't try to push my sister one way or the other.\" \"Moving to Florida at the age of 15 comes with a lot of challenges and sacrifices. But pushing through that helped her mature and grow as a person and helped her develop her game. That is why she ended up at Stanford University and was able to thrive.\"\n\nWhether through the national, regional or German youth teams, Krauter has gained experience in the type of golf right for Stanford – representing a team to a somewhat individualist side, and becoming aware of the mental challenges of game play, the format used in the final rounds of the game. NCAA Championships.\n\nAt Krauter's request, the Saddlebrook coach reached out to Walker, who had seen Allen play at the 2017 British Ladies' Amateur. The biggest impression Krauter made wasn't her performance (she hasn't advanced past the last 64), but her maturity.\n\n\"I remember the first hole I saw of her, it was her behavior that shocked me,\" Walker said. Her chin was high. She walked to the next tee. There was no drama, there was no shaking.\n\n\"Usually, what we see in junior golf, especially when the coach is watching, they are going to provoke their over-emotional response whatever the outcome, because they think, I think, that makes the coach want them more. Allen didn't do that, that's what really caught my attention, She responded with incredible poise.\n\n\"She picked her golf ball out of the hole. She walked to get her bag. She walked to the next tee and kept going as if it had never happened.\"\n\nAt Stanford, Krauter was determined not to be allowed to put her on the \"walk\". She made her way into the squad at season opener Annika Intercollegiate and finished as player No. 3. She has been in the squad ever since.\n\n* * *\n\nPhoto by Bob Drebin / ISIphotos.com.\n\nkrauter is The team's metronome, which ranks high on the leaderboard every time while exceptional teammates over the years like Andrea Lee, Albany Valenzuela, Zhang or Heck, grab the headlines with higher finishes.\n\nThe Krauter's strength lies in its consistency from tee to green, averaging 16 greens per round. Sometimes, she'll hit all 18. And she's almost always halfway, and she puts herself in a good position.\n\nThe average scoring for the Crauter season is 72.07. Her career average is 72.58. In 27 rounds this season, Krauter has never shot more than 77.\n\n\"She showed up wanting to make the most of her time here with a very clear goal, which is to be the best she can be over the course of four years,\" Walker said. \"She just put her head down and really focused on every single day.\"\n\nSuch was the case in its biggest victory, the 2020 Women's Amateur Championship, the tournament that, along with American Women's Amateur, is the highest honor in women's amateur golf.\n\nIn the final bout at West Lancashire Golf Club in Liverpool against Annabelle Fuller, an Englishwoman now at the University of Florida, Krauter was three times behind after the first four holes.\n\n\"My opponent thought she was already with me,\" said Krauter. \"But I will never give up.\"\n\nIn fact, Krauter won six of the next eight holes, only to have Fuller make a comeback on her own as the title reached the end.\n\nOn 17 par-3, Krauter fired in a vault. She remembered that her ball was further from the hole than Fuller and Krauter should have taken the next shot. But Crotter said but Fuller, who didn't realize the ball's distances, shot outside the turn.\n\n\"I was definitely the farthest,\" Krauter said. \"There was a bases official next to me and I said, I think she's about to get hit, but it's not her turn.\" And you hit her very close.\"\n\nKrauter could have asked the official to invalidate Fuller's shot, but he did not, because he felt the tournament should be won on merit rather than technical reasons. Fuller won the pit.\n\n\"I could have lost because of that, because I didn't call her about it,\" Krauter said. \"Looking back, if I had lost, I probably would have regretted it. But that's not really who I am. It doesn't represent me at all.\"\n\nInstead, Krotter kept his cool and finished 18th for a dramatic win. As a bonus, she earned waivers in all LPGA majors for the following year, as well as the Augusta Women's National Amateur Championships.\n\nPhotography by John Todd / ISIphotos.com.\n\nAllen believes the major tournaments have changed her life, because her dealings with the world's best players – including Germany's Caroline Mason, who provided encouragement, advice and practicing round companionship – have confirmed Krauter's desire for a professional career.\n\nAt each stop, Tim would accompany Allen, carrying her bag and asking for his advice from the cans of the best LPGA players.\n\nAllen passed the Augusta National Women's Amateur to play in the ANA Inspiration, her first professional tournament (as an amateur), hoping to receive an invitation to the Augusta National the following year and be rewarded for her patience.\n\nKrauter didn't play well in the top nine, making up for the course's difficulties. But Krauter mustered (pattern?) and birdie the last three holes.\n\nWhen it was over, Tim and Allen embraced. Tim said he was proud of her. They started crying.\n\n\"Lots of feelings,\" she said. \"My heart was pounding out of my chest. There were so many people watching on day 18. They were clapping for my plane and I couldn't handle it. I was laughing and crying. I didn't know what was going on.\"\n\n* * *\n\nPhoto by Bob Drebin / ISIphotos.com.\n\nthis season It was a rollercoaster for Stanford – with injuries and a heck of an absence for most of the spring for medical reasons. But the ups and downs didn't significantly affect Stanford's playing. The Cardinal, despite his young age, is still No. 1 and Krauter was vital in keeping the team in one piece.\n\n\"My personality sort of allows it,\" Krauter said. \"If there's a group, I try to keep it cohesive. I feel very conservative and I am very careful about what I say. I also never want to steal the spotlight from anyone.\"\n\n\"I feel like I've flown completely under the radar. People may still not know me. But I've never wanted to necessarily highlight. I don't really need to. I like to continue my work in silence. I like to work hard behind the scenes, and then go up and surprise people.\"\n\nTerritorial turned out fine after all. Stanford fired 7-under and tied for second, advancing to the NCAA Championship for the 12th consecutive season. But the starring soundtrack was Krauter and her soothing words to her teammates, words that eased a bit of anxiety.\n\n\"I really tried to emphasize how well we did and how proud we were of each other for showing up when needed,\" Krauter said. \"I basically tried to show the girls a sense of comfort and security to make sure they weren't putting too much pressure on themselves or worrying about external factors.\"\n\nKrauter's main message: \"Just have fun.\"\n\nAnd they'll keep looking for fun while knocking a few heads at the same time. It's no longer about wheels of motion, it's about being cool when you can, and being good when you're not. Yes, it's about winning trophies, but it's also about camaraderie and teamwork.", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "117290e7-a55b-430f-9980-ffc9920b4616", "url": "http://bb-blues.com/index.php/2022/05/18/anchor-stanford-university-athletics/"}
{"text": "We sat in silence for a few minutes before I took charge and broke the silence.\n\n\"So, she sang and now we\\'ll have to take care of Joe.\" In my mind, I had already started to formulate how Darcy had wanted to take the information. I wondered if he had put Joe up to it. Then I had wondered why he would put a hit on the man if that was the case. And that was when it struck me. The greedy bastard had raised his price or had intended to withhold the information because he wanted something more out of it. Security, maybe? And soon, I would find out.\n\nBut I could mention none of this to Anthony. What was I supposed to do with the information? If this could be pinned down to Darcy, it would be a huge factor and a possible reason to carry out the raid as soon as possible.\n\n\"We can\\'t be sure that he\\'s not passed the information on to someone. We tail him until we know if he has.\" I nod sharply and feel the relief pulsing through my veins. Whatever be the consequence, I would be able to see the end of the bargain. But I also needed to hear the transaction, and I had a feeling that Anthony would appreciate it as well. And I would tell him the plan concocting in my little brain.\n\n\"Why don\\'t we put on a microphone on him? We could hear every conversation he has, then. What do you think about that?\" I ask him hesitantly. He nods thoughtfully and then gives me a look that I can\\'t decipher.\n\n\"How are you going to do it?\"\n\n\"I know that we have the equipment. Eric made sure that I knew what all I needed for tailing someone. Not that I didn\\'t know myself, but he supplied some really neat things. So, that won\\'t be a problem,\" I passed on my thoughts to him.\n\n\"How will you get in on him?\" he asked, now interested.\n\n\"I\\'ll wait until he extracts himself from the ladies for a while and trip on him and then apologizes for being terribly clumsy and then walk out.\" He burst into laughter and shook his head. I think he mumbled best of luck, but I couldn\\'t be sure.\n\nI grabbed the little machine and went right back into the bar. Joe, though, was missing. And I knew that this place only had one entrance and exit: the one that could be seen from the street. So he could only be in one place.\n\nThe washroom.\n\nThe other girls had dispersed throughout the room and were trying to get their job done. I sauntered over to the loo and found that the door was opened. There was no real sound coming from inside the damn place, so I carefully entered it. My nerves were on end, prepared to pounce on the first object of threat that came my way. Nothing of the sort happened. I heard the soft sounds coming from one of the stalls and smirked to myself. I had caught them in the spot that I had hoped to. I lazily turned on the tap of the sink and pretended to do whatever it was that people did. I washed my hands until I thought they were cleaner than ever. Then I dried them on my jeans and went to fix my hair with the rubber band on my wrist. When I tried to knot my hair into a bun, I heard the sound of the stall right behind me opening. I looked at the reflection of the door in the mirror and saw Joe emerge from the stall and then the girl I had labeled as his finest prostitute.\n\nWhile he fumbled with his shirt, she just straightened her shirt like she was used to it. She probably was. Joe looked at me through the mirror and gave me a smirk. I tried to give him a polite smirk and continued to work on my hair, taking longer than usual to tie it.\n\nOnce he was done, he pulled out his cell phone and started speaking in hushed tones with whoever was on the other side. I couldn\\'t make out much of what he was saying as I looked around the room to make the perfect accident happen. I heard him huff and knew that he was done. I hurried past him or pretended to. I placed my foot on the small puddle of water near his foot and forcefully slipped. Instinctively, my hands tried to grip the first thing it found near it. In a knee jerk reaction, his grip loosened and the cell phone fell on the floor and scattered. Despite that, he tried to balance me and then helped me on my foot.\n\nI smiled at him with false nervousness and then apologized profusely as I assembled the pieces of the phone. He flirted with me through the process not giving me a hand as I crouched on the floor and put the pieces of his cell phone together.\n\n\"Come back soon, sugar,\" I heard him say as I rushed out of the washroom and out of the bar. A smirk formed on my lips as I entered the truck and raised an eyebrow at Anthony.\n\n\"I figured that he\\'d change his clothes, but he\\'d never keep the phone away,\" I shrugged and turned to the music system that now transmitted the sounds around Joe.\n\n\"Good thinking,\" he appreciated and then we went back to listening in on the conversation.\n\nEverything that happened after that seemed to be insignificant. Time ticked by and the long minutes stretched into an hour. It wasn\\'t until then that we saw someone else trying to enter the bar. So far, we had only seen people leaving, not one single person had moved out of the bar at its peak hour.\n\nWe sat straighter as we saw the newcomer. When he turned to look around to check if anyone was looking, I burst out into a fit of laughter. Anthony was startled by my reaction and hissed at me to shut up. I listened eventually, but couldn\\'t control the shaking of my body.\n\n\"Fuck, there you have it. You\\'ve got him by the balls, Anthony. He\\'s going down.\" And he seemed pleased with that. It was like hitting two birds with one bullet, that too point blank.\n\n---------\n\n[Donate @ paypal.me/SunScar9 and ko-fi.com/sunscar9 to ensure I don\\'t starve.]", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "b7c86179-80da-4a7e-af2f-261e4b1d6261", "url": "https://readfullnovel.net/the-story-of-blood-and-roses/chapter-91-terribly-clumsy"}

{"text": "A Personal Note From the Founder\n\nIt's been a while. I hope you are well and that your summer has gotten off to a wonderful start.\n\nI took a hiatus from blog-writing for a couple of weeks to work on a special project and it's almost complete. More on that in a moment.\n\nI have felt the call to impact lives for some time. It's why I became a coach. Like you, I am on my own journey to grow and contribute. Hence, the special project I've been working on.\n\nOne of the things that drove me to become a coach was that I wanted my life to matter, I wanted to contribute in more ways than just the bottom line of a property asset, although that was fun, too. I wanted to leave my mark on this world. Meaning, I wanted to make a positive impact on more people than I currently had influence with at the time I made that decision. As time passes and I get further into my journey, I gain greater and greater clarity about what that looks like.\n\nSide note: There's a take-away for you in that statement alone. Oftentimes we start a journey when we have no idea what every leg of the journey will look like. You CAN'T know. There is no way that you can really sit back at your desk and plan every detail of a journey start to finish. Nor would it serve you to try. The best parts are the unexpected ones! The journey doesn't always look the way you think it will. That's so it can look even better.\n\nBack to my story and what I've been up to the last few weeks.\n\nI started asking myself for deeper clarity and detail about my core message and what I want to impart to people. If I had to boil it down to a sentence, what do I want to tell people? In a nutshell, it came down to this:\n\n#GoForIt\n\nIf you've been reading my blog articles and/or emails for any amount of time, you know I always sign off with \"Today is the day to #GoForIt. #LiveDeliberately.\"\n\nI asked myself What is it that holds most people back from #GoingForIt? As I thought back to the thousands of coaching conversations I've had with clients over the years some themes started to emerge. My core message gained some clarity. Before I knew it, I had something to say and a project to work on. So today, I'm announcing to you that...\n\n🎉I finished the rough draft of my book. 🎉\n\nThe working title is How to Just Go For It: 6 Things to Ignore to Build a Life You Love.\n\nI'll be sharing more about it as details become available. I just wanted to share the good news with you and let you know where I've been and why you haven't been getting emails from me. I've been in intense work mode!\n\nNext up is editing, finalizing the title and cover design, getting it set up on Amazon and all those other wonderful behind-the-scenes details that must happen to make the message available.\n\nI am incredibly excited to share it with you soon. Perhaps I'll include some excerpts in future emails??\n\nAs always...", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "f2f746d5-43e9-48c8-a733-70a2a50952b9", "url": "https://personal-evolution-company.mykajabi.com/blog/a-personal-note-from-the-founder"}

Flying Fish has already made 10 investments in Fund II.\n\n\"When we started Flying Fish Partners, we were one of the first venture firms to recognize AI and ML as a rich investment opportunity and to leverage the Pacific Northwest's strength in the sector,\" said Geoff Harris, Flying Fish co-founder and managing director. \"We believe our early confidence in the sector has proven out already and that we are still very early in the AI/ML revolution.\"\n\nFlying Fish's team comes from a heavily operational background. Its three founders – Harris, Heather Redman and Frank Chang – have deep and complementary technical, operating and investing expertise.\n\nIn Fund II, the team adds Adriane Brown as managing director. Brown is an accomplished executive and board member of Fortune 100 companies and previously served as a venture partner in Fund I. Vanessa Pegueros, a cybersecurity expert and seasoned executive who served as a venture partner in Fund I, continues to serve as a venture partner in Fund II. Flying Fish also adds Lisa Nelson, co-founder of M12 and an active advisor and independent board member, as a new venture partner in Fund II.

Portland-based standout Streem (sold to Frontdoor) was also an early investment in Fund I.\n\n\"Increasingly early-stage investors in particular must specialize to have the necessary expertise to sort through the staggering number of new startups each year,\" said Chang, Flying Fish co-founder and managing director. \"We've found our focused thesis and deep roots in AI and ML to be very attractive to founders as well as to investors.\"\n\n\"As an ex-DeepMind and Google team with a big idea, we had a lot of interest and options when we decided to move to Seattle to start Phaidra.ai,\" said Jim Gao, Phaidra.ai CEO. \"We chose Flying Fish because of the team's AI and ML expertise, their roll-up-their-sleeves approach to every aspect of the business and their commitment to diversity. We'd make the same choice today.\"\n\nWhile Flying Fish has invested in startup companies in the Pacific Northwest and Western Canada, its reach has expanded geographically. Several of its initial investments in Fund II are located along the East Coast of the United States and Canada.\n\n\"As a result of our early entry into the AI and ML sector, we find that we have deal flow from across the U.S. and Canada,\" said Redman, Flying Fish co-founder and managing director. \"Though we still love our backyard, it's been gratifying to see our brand become known broadly.\"\n\nAbout Flying Fish Partners\nFlying Fish Partners, based in Seattle, is an early-stage venture firm focused on providing capital and value-added support to fast-growing, high-potential AI and ML technology companies in the U.S. and Canada.

I have to say making an investment like this by reading the reviews and description was taking a chance, however, it was the right choice for me. I opted for the regular tension and found it very comfortable, along with the Woolroom Duvet set(mattress protector, pillows & duvet) I sleep very cosily. Yes it is a weighty mattress but the handles on all sides make it easier to turn and rotate, yes very cosy sleep nights", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "65677b89-68ab-4898-a70d-2a4fa00cb1ff", "url": "https://www.thewoolroom.com/product/ryeland-10750-mattress/?sku=ma10750srt"}

We are staunch believers in ongoing training and as such significantly invest and support our lawyers in the development of their practice at the firm.\n\nAs a constantly growing firm, we are always interested in hearing from talented and motivated candidates who feel they would thrive at our firm. We welcome applications from qualified lawyers, trainees (Swiss law and international law), professional support and administrative staff. #acareeratlalive #lifeatlalive\n\nLife at lalive\n\nBENOIT ARTHUR MAURON\n\nPartner specialising in litigation\n\nWhen I became a father over two years ago I was the first to benefit from the firm's new initiative to grant two weeks of fully paid paternity leave. Since then new fathers across the firm benefit from four weeks of fully paid leave. I find this to be a good gesture of the firm in its efforts to improve working conditions, support its employees and promote gender equality in the workplace, which I believe can only be attained by allowing fathers to be more involved at home. Going forward, I appreciate the firm's flexible working hours policy which includes working from home when needed.\n\nANDRE BRUNSCHWEILER\n\nPartner\n\nI had the pleasure of being one of the first members of the LALIVE Zurich office when it opened in 2010. We were only 3 lawyers back then and in only 8 years have evolved into a structure with 20 lawyers. Naturally, with our Geneva office with a history of more than 50 years and over 60 lawyers from more than 15 jurisdictions and as many languages spoken, the Zurich office never was a real \"start-up\" but I always enjoyed working in a relatively small and young team in a truly international and very dynamic environment. The flat hierarchy, combined with a great portion of autonomy in my work from day one, have always been a great selling point.\n\nANTON VALLÉLIAN\n\nAssociate\n\nI studied international law and human rights law for a good part of my career, so it was important for me to find an international firm that shared my values. Quite uniquely in Switzerland and in law firms in general, in Lalive I found a firm that is not afraid to defend its ideas on the domestic or international stage, and I had the opportunity to give life to the principles I studied and see international law and human rights law in action.\n\nJAIME GALLEGO\n\nPartner\n\nI joined LALIVE in early 2009 as an associate and since then have worked on a very good mix of commercial and investment arbitrations, ranging from very large to smaller cases. As a lawyer qualified both in England and Wales and Spain, arbitrations subject to a broad range of laws, both from common law jurisdictions and civil law jurisdictions, have come my way. The dual qualification has also been a boon in the field of investment arbitration where the legal solutions often have a mixed origin.\n\nJULIETTE ASSO\n\nCounsel specialising in international arbitration\n\nWhen I was a trainee, I was treated like a full member of the team on the cases I worked on (which included attending hearings). Since becoming an associate, I have been given more responsibility and the opportunity to manage small cases from beginning to end. On larger cases, I work closely with experts and witnesses on a day to day basis on the issues I am in charge of.\n\nKatja Böttcher\n\nLegal Project Manager\n\nAfter 13 years at the Swiss Federal Police, working primary in a leadership role, I was looking for a new challenge in the private sector. While I had a legal background, my experience in law enforcement was not an obvious fit for a traditional law firm.\n\nInternational trainees\n\nWe offer 6-month internships in our International Arbitration Practice Group in Geneva.\n\nWe welcome applications from candidates demonstrating a keen interest in international arbitration, whether through academic studies or practical experience, as well as excellence.\n\nOur positions are filled on a rolling basis, with the next available position starting in August 2023.

{"text": "Grandad Takes Grandaughter To Prom Because She Didn't Have A Date\n\nProm night can be a nervy occasion for students – particularly those who haven't got a date. Being the only one sat in the corner while all your mates dance the night away is the stuff of nightmares.\n\nLuckily for one teen in California, USA, her grandad stepped in to make sure she wasn't on her lonesome.\n\nKaylah Bell, 17, certainly had her outfit down for the big night, sporting a watercolour gown with a shiny pink and purple cape.\n\nBut this would have all been for nothing if she was stood on her tod in all of her pictures. Fortunately, 67-year-old grandad Alvin Hackett was by her side and looking just as dapper in his swanky suit.\n\nIn a tweet, Kaylah said: \"My papa knew I didn't have a date to my prom so he matched me!!!!!!!!\"\n\nThe tweet has since been liked more than 104,000 times and evidently people were touched by the grandad's gesture.\n\nOne person said: \"This is what they call father love and unending admiration of his little baby… This is something my dad will do too.\"\n\nAnother said: \"I tell you one day when she has settled down with her husband or not, she will not regret not taking her Dad out. This will always fill her heart with joy when he's not around.\n\nI love my Dad so much I know she will always appreciate this moment so these other dudes don't matter.\"\n\nAlvin and Kaylah looked the part. Credit: Twitter\n\nSure, these guys missed the memo that Alvin is her grandad, but still, the sentiment comes from the right place.\n\nSpeaking to the Daily Mail, Kaylah said: \"My family is very flashy and the dress just wasn't flashy enough, so my auntie told me to add the diamond belt and add the cape.\n\n\"My grandpa is a pastor of his own church and people say he is the sharpest pastor in the Antelope Valley. So I'm sure he already had his look in his closet.\n\n\"My papa matching was truly a blessing to me, it makes me emotional to think about it because we are super close.

Then his prize suspect, Rob Toshack, is murdered in custody. Furious, Quill pursues the investigation, co-opting intelligence analyst Lisa Ross and undercover cops Costain and Sefton. But nothing about Toshack's murder is normal. Toshack had struck a bargain with a vindictive entity, whose occult powers kept Toshack one step ahead of the law - until his luck ran out. Now, the team must find a 'suspect' who can bend space and time and alter memory itself. And they will kill again.\n\nIt was recommended as like Rivers of London (no)My name is Peter Grant, and I am a keeper of the secret flame - whatever that is.\n\nTruth be told, there's a lot I still don't know. My superior Nightingale, previously the last of England's wizardly governmental force, is trying to teach me proper schooling for a magician's apprentice. But even he doesn't have all the answers. Mostly I'm just a constable sworn to enforce the Queen's Peace, with the occasional help from some unusual friends and a well-placed fire blast. With the new year, I have three main objectives: a) pass the detective exam so I can officially become a DC, b) work out what the hell my relationship with Lesley Mai, an old friend from the force and now fellow apprentice, is supposed to be, and, most importantly, c) get through the year without destroying a major landmark.\n\nTwo out of three isn't bad, right?\n\nA mutilated body in Crawley means another murderer is on the loose. The prime suspect is one Robert Weil, who may either be a common serial killer or an associate of the twisted magician known as the Faceless Man - a man whose previous encounters I've barely survived. I've also got a case about a town planner going under a tube train and another about a stolen grimoire.\n\nBut then I get word of something very odd happening in Elephant and Castle, on a housing estate designed by a nutter, built by charlatans, and inhabited by the truly desperate. If there's a connection to the Crawley case, I'll be entering some tricky waters of juristiction with the local river spirits. We have a prickly history, to say the least.\n\nReviews - Please select the tabs below to change the source of reviews.\n\nFinally, it's out!\n\nI had been really looking forward to this one for a long time. Just the facft that I read this one so soon after it came out should tell you something. This book goes a long way towards moving the over-arching story of the series forward. It is good, but is different than the oteher books. The story is less focused, more of a day in the life with a lot of what appear to unrelated instances tying together at the end. I didn't care for the style as much as the prior books. The thing is there is a twist at the end that makes this one totally worth it. The narrarator is top notch. If you like the others in this series you will like this one though it may take a little bit of getting used to.\n\nGreat Series Getting Even Better!\n\nSomehow, I missed the release of Broken Homes, and just happened to see it when browsing a few days ago. I instantly snapped it up and began listening immediately. As you will see from my previous reviews, I love the Peter Grant series, and I think Ben Aaronovitch is the most creative, imaginative and entertaining writer I have run into in a long time.\n\nI see from the current reviews of this book that there is some difference of opinion about the story of Broken Homes. I am one of those who think this book is as good as the first in the series, and that's saying a lot. This story is different from the previous books, which had pretty linear stories. In Broken Homes, there are numerous story lines going on at the same time, and the reader can't be certain which of those stories (if any) have anything to do with what emerges as the main storyline. So, you are taken along on several roller coasters at once, having to trust that things will come together in the end (at least some things).\n\nOrdinarily, books like that drive me crazy, but in this case each separate storyline is so amusing and so much fun that I forget to worry about the end. Many characters from previous books in the series appear in Broken Homes, both friend and foe, and not many new characters are presented for you to keep track of. The members of the Folly seem to be getting more settled and together, and are actually able to work together without having huge fights. Arch-villain The Faceless Man remains the primary evil opponent, and is suitably vile both in person and through representatives.\n\nThen, near the end, there is a huge twist in the plot which puts everything you think you know about this story at a new angle, and I, for one, was left in shock, mouth hanging open.\n\nAs with the previous books, I will say: READ THIS BOOK! But only after you have read the previous books in the Peter Grant series. That is really necessary to get the real flavor of the characters and their relationships.\n\nThe return of Peter Grant Wizard/Policeman\n\nWhere does Broken Homes rank among all the audiobooks you've listened to so far?\n\nThis is a great series in the Urban Fantasy genre and this is the best of the (currently) four books in the series.\n\nWhat other book might you compare Broken Homes to and why?\n\nIf you like the Dresden Files books you should do yourself a favor and listen to this book (and the related series). It is the ongoing story of an Apprentice Wizard who is also a Police officer for the London Metropolitan Police force. It is almost (but not quite) a police procedural with magic.\n\nWhat about Kobna Holdbrook-Smith's performance did you like?\n\nKobna Holdbrook-Smith should be reading anything and everything that requires a British accent he is a brilliant vocal talent. He really brings the characters to life.\n\nWas this a book you wanted to listen to all in one sitting?\n\nI could have listed to this whole book without stopping and found myself extending my walk/drive/other activity so that I could listen to more.\n\nAny additional comments?\n\nI will say (without spoilers) that when you get to the twist in the last quarter of the book that I was stunned speechless and now curse that the book is over and I will have to wait for the next one (whenever that is)\n\nWonderful, just wonderful\n\nI started reading the Peter Grant/Rivers of London series by Ben Aaronovitch based on a friend's recommendation, and I admit, I wasn't really expecting much. But boy, was I wrong. These are excellent police procedurals, set in modern London, but with magic added to the mix. The characters are vivid, interesting, and believable, and it's a real pleasure to have the protagonist be a constable, not a DCI; a working class person, not posh; and a person of colour, not white.\n\nThe narrator, Kobna Holdbrook-Smith is PERFECT for the books and adds to the enjoyment of the story. Highly recommended.\n\nAmazing\n\nHoldbrook-Smith is the best narrator I have ever listened to (and I have listened to many!). I was a bit more leary of this book because the other reviews mentioned that it was different from the first three. I am SO glad that I downloaded this book. It is a great book and I completely did not see the ending coming. Ben Aaronovitch is an amazing author. I can't believe I now have to wait for the next book!\n\nBest in the series, with a cliffhanger\n\nA pivotal book in the series, ending with a massive cliffhanger and a host of unanswered questions. As always, Aaronovitch has a deft hand with Peter Grant's personality and patois. Nightingale and Lesley remain well-drawn and interesting, and the various supernatural elements of London are further revealed and reveled in. I can't wait to turn to the next book and see where things move and whether particular harms can be mended.\n\nAs always, Kobna Holdbrook-Smith is outstanding (especially since he isn't called upon to do any extended American accents).\n\nPerfect audiobook marriage of author & narrator\n\nThis is such an entertaining series of books. Ben Aaronovitch's writing has a light and humorous undercurrent. The descriptive scenery, attention to detail, insightful observations, and brilliant conversations keep the listener's interest.\n\nKobna Holdbrook-Smith is wonderful with the distinctive character's voices and acting. There is no rote reading of a book here. The only flub up on the narration was in a past book with an odd American accent. But, I still rate Holdbrook-Smith as a 10 out of 10 narrator, very strong in acting ability and with a range of accents that still holds true when voicing conversations between a man and a woman. What awesome talent!\n\nThis is a wonderful book series that has been greatly enhanced by being matched with the perfect narrator.\n\nAdditionally, this is a professionally turned out audio series. I enjoy the musical interludes between chapters.\n\nIf a person is looking for an entertaining book series, with interesting plots and characters, with consistently clever ideas being tossed to the listener, the Peter Grant series is one I highly recommend.\n\nNarrator 5 Stars as Before Story a Bit Wonky\n\nI've bought and loved all of the prior Peter Grant. Even in one case when I had been given an ARC of Midnight Riot (the US title for the first Peter Grant book) I also bought the Audible download because of the excellent narration by Kobna Holdbrook-Smith. Therefore it pains me a great deal to have to say that I do not think this story is quite up to the standard of the first three.\n\nThere's a lack of cohesion to the plot which bounces around from story line to story line without settling down. Then I didn't find the ending particularly satisfying. There's a big unanswered question at the end. If you need to be spoiled before starting the book look at the Amazon reviews. Look for the review that Tells All.\n\nQuite liked the title given the theme of the novel and Peter gets to display his architectural background as well as some fascinating tidbits about London. Numerous characters from past books make appearances. Although the story line about the Faceless Man moves forward a bit, it also started to feel like there were too many characters.\n\nNew readers go back to the first book and start there. You need to be invested in the characters and the story before you can really appreciate this one.\n\nI also saw where the series has been optioned for television. I would be really pleased if it did go into production.\n\nGreat Addition to a Great Series\n\nBroken Homes is the fourth in the Peter Grant series. I am still amazed at how much I enjoy this series. The old familiar characters are back with new twists and turns. I am giving the story four stars instead of five only because I got a bit lost in the theory of why the bad guy was doing what he was doing. If you like a bit of the supernatural, a bit of the police procedural, and a bit of the absurd, this is where you will find it.\n\nOMG How will I survive until the next book?\n\nWould you consider the audio edition of Broken Homes to be better than the print version?\n\nThe Narrator keeps me grounded in the differing accents of the characters... adding a level of complexity I might have missed had I read the book in my own American accent in my head.\n\nWas this a book you wanted to listen to all in one sitting?\n\nYES, it was hard to stop.\n\nAny additional comments?\n\nBook three was not as great as the first two, leading me to wonder whether Mr Aaronovitch was having difficulty maintaining his commitments. This book brought me back as thoroughly as PC Grant escorting a suspect in for questioning. Do not miss thisol\n\n06-11-18\n\nFabulous\n\nI know I'm repeating myself but Kobna is so engaging, you can't stop listening to him. Love these stories and can't wait for the next installment Mr Aaronovitch. I troll the site for more narrations by Kobna, he truly is a voicesmith!", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "b65aa7b8-1d87-4246-8b67-67a08f5d0f72", "url": "https://www.audible.ca.cdn.amazon.com/pd/Broken-Homes-Audiobook/B00IA53J6Y"}

{"text": "New Eintracht Frankfurt sporting director Markus Krösche had only one piece of definitive information to share with assembled members of German media during his introductory virtual press conference on Tuesday.\n\nWhen it came to the fate of his two most influential players, strong words will have to suffice for now.\n\nThe former Leipzig exec. insisted that, with solid arguments, the club had a \"very good chance\" of retaining André Silva and Filip Kostic.\n\nFrankfurt still have many other players due back on loan. Striker Gonçalo Paciencia and keeper Frederick Rønnow are scheduled to return at the end of the month from Schalke. Midfielders Rodrigo Zalazar (FC St. Pauli) and Nils Stendera (Lokomotiv Leipzig), as well center-forward Dejan Jovelic (Wolfsberger AC) also have June 30th return date stamps.\n\nAsked a direction question about the other loaned out players, Krösche acknowledged that the administrative focus needed to secure the services of new head-coach Oliver Glasner hadn't necessarily afforded him the time to consider them yet. That, at least, was the interpretation of most German football journalists.\n\n\"I will discuss that with the coach in the coming days,\" Krösche replied when asked about them.\n\n\"I will try everything, together with the coach, to convince them that it makes sense to continue along with us on this path,\" he noted, \"whether or not we succeed shall be seen. The lads have their own ideas, but they know what they have here in Frankfurt.\"\n\nKrösche specifically addressed the case of Silva, who's sensational 28-goal league campaign (29 tallies across all competitions) leaves him with more than enough caché to move to a Champions' League club.\n\n\"I think we have a very good chance that he will stay with us,\" Krösche remarked with some confidence, \"André knows that it worked out very well with us last year and the way we want to play football will help him keep scoring goals.\"\n\nIn addition to making the case for \"selective reinforcements\", the 40-year-old noted that he would use the return of the SGE ultras as a talking point in keeping both players. Eintracht will still play in the Europa League next season. Both Kostic and Silva have some experience with stadium atmosphere from the 2019/20 campaign.\n\n\"Playing in front of the fans in Europe will be a tremendous factor that will be tremendous fun for both of them as it is for us,\" Krösche noted.\n\nKrösche also took the opportunity to speak directly to the club fans by discussing his living arrangements. Unlike predecessor Fredi Bobic, the new sporting director won't be staying in a luxury hotel as part of his commute to work. Though the former SC Paderborn professional's family remain in East Westphalia, he has rented out a modest apartment in the area.\n\n\"It's extremely important for me to have my own apartment and be a real Frankfurter,\" he told the press corps, \"Eintracht Frankfurt has always been a club with great tradition and charisma. I'm extremely happy to be a part of this club and am impressed by its extraordinary fans.\"", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "cbb4c657-3e30-4844-b962-59506e015cc4", "url": "https://bulinews.com/news/8667/"}

{"text": "Imre Szellő Could Be Set for World Title Shot\n\nHungarian cruiserweight champion Imre Szellő has put himself in the frame for a shot at the WBO world cruiserweight title, currently held by Ukraine's Oleksandr Usyk, after he kept up his unbeaten professional record with his 17th straight win coming over Tamás Tóth at the Lakeside Hotel, Székesfehervár.\n\nSzellő is arguably the brightest boxer in Hungary today and in beating Tóth, he defended the WBO intercontinental title, which boosts his ranking with the organisation and adds his name to the list of possible contenders for Usyk in the near future.\n\nIt was Szellő who took control of the contest from very early into the bout, as he dominated with the jab and forced Toth to be on the back-foot. Eventually, Szellő pushed for the stoppage in the fifth round and he got it when referee Micky Vann stopped the fight as Toth was struggling to see due to a cut above his right eye.\n\nThe 34-year-old competed at the 2008 Olympics in Beijing but only made his professional debut in 2014. He won the Hungarian cruiserweight crown after just his second fight, where he beat Gyula Bozai by unanimous decision after ten rounds.\n\nSzellő took a big step towards a world title shot when he won his intercontinental title, where he defeated Brazilian Hamilton Ventura for the belt last September. Since then, he has had wins over Drazan Janjanin and Garrett Wilson; the former of which he beat by technical knockout in the seventh round of their contest.\n\nIf Szellő does sign a deal to fight Usyk for the WBO cruiserweight title, he will be facing the number one ranked boxer by The Ring Magazine in the division. The man, who is nicknamed The Cat, won the gold medal in the heavyweight category at the London Olympics. He has not tasted defeat yet in his professional career, which spans 12 fights, while ten of those victories have come via stoppages.\n\nUsyk won his world title back in September when the judges unanimously gave him the decision over Poland's Krzysztof Glowacki in an excellent performance in Gdansk. Since then, he has defended his title twice, beating Thibiso Mchunu and Michael Hunter.\n\nSzello's promotional team will also be looking at the other options in the cruiserweight division. WBA champion Denis Lebedev and IBF holder Murat Gassiev are set to meet in a unification contest later this year. Gassiev beat his Russian compatriot in a split decision last December. He is the odds-on favourite at 1/2 to get the better of Lebedev again. If you are looking to have a bet on that contest though, it may be worth taking a look at the sign-up offers available from the leading bookmakers, which can be found on comparison sites such as  .\n\nThe other world champion in the cruiserweight division who has yet to announce his next fight is Mairis Briedis. The Latvian won the WBC belt which was vacated by Tony Bellew when he got the better of Marco Huck earlier this month.\n\nWhatever route Szellő goes down, it is only a matter of time before a world title shot is presented to him where he'll be looking to add his name to a Hungarian boxing history.", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "cbd9c3de-4fc0-4d79-8e79-2541527b3587", "url": "https://dailynewshungary.com/imre-szello-set-world-title-shot/"}

Some hosts will provide free bonus offers when you sign up, such as a totally free domain name, or a free SSL certification.\n\nWhile some hosts will certainly be able to offer better performance and also high levels of protection.

You'll learn what core holding attributes are important in a host and exactly how to evaluate your own holding needs to make sure that you can pick from one of the very best cheap holding suppliers below.\n\nDisclosure: When you buy a webhosting package through web links on this page, we make some compensation. This helps us to maintain this site running. There are no added expenses to you in all by utilizing our links. The listed here is of the very best cheap host plans that I've directly used as well as examined.\n\nWhat We Think aboutTo Be Inexpensive WebhostingWhen we define a web hosting bundle as being \"Low-cost\" or \"Budget plan\" what we mean is hosting that falls into the cost bracket in between $0.80 to $4 each month. Whilst investigating low-cost organizing carriers for this guide, we looked at over 100 various hosts that came under that price range. We then assessed the high quality of their most inexpensive holding plan, value for money and customer care.\n\nIn this short article, I'll be going over this world-class website organizing firm and stick in as much pertinent info as possible.\n\nI'll look at the features, the rates alternatives, and anything else I can think of that I think may be of benefit, if you're choosing to sign up to Bluhost as well as obtain your websites up and running.\n\nSo without more ado, let's check it out.\n\nBluehost Review\n\nBluehost is one of the greatest host companies on the planet, getting both substantial advertising and marketing assistance from the company itself and associate marketing professionals who advertise it.\n\nIt really is a substantial business, that has actually been around for a long time, has a big track record, and also is most definitely among the leading choices when it concerns web hosting (certainly within the top 3, at least in my publication).\n\nHowever what is it specifically, as well as should you get its services?\n\nToday, I will address all there is you need to understand, provided that you are a blogger or an entrepreneur who is searching for a web host, as well as does not know where to start, since it's a great service for that target market in general.\n\nLet's picture, you want to organize your sites and also make them noticeable. Okay?\n\nYou already have your domain (which is your site destination or LINK) now you intend to \"turn the lights on\". Best Hosting Service To Use As Temporary Website\n\nYou require some hosting…\n\nTo achieve every one of this, and also to make your website visible, you require what is called a \"web server\". A web server is a black box, or gadget, that stores all your web site information (files such as pictures, texts, video clips, links, plugins, and also various other info).\n\nCurrently, this server, needs to get on regularly as well as it has to be linked to the web 100% of the time (I'll be pointing out something called \"downtime\" later on).\n\nIn addition, it additionally needs (without obtaining also expensive and into details) a file transfer protocol commonly known as FTP, so it can show web internet browsers your site in its designated kind.\n\nAll these things are either pricey, or call for a high level of technical ability (or both), to develop as well as maintain. And also you can totally go out there and find out these things by yourself as well as established them up … but what regarding as opposed to you acquiring and maintaining one … why not simply \"renting holding\" rather?\n\n\"This is where Bluehost is available in. You lease their web servers (called Shared Hosting) as well as you introduce a web siteusing those servers.\"\n\nSince Bluehost maintains all your documents, the firm also allows you to establish your material monitoring systems (CMS, for brief) such as WordPress for you. WordPress is a super prominent CMS … so it just makes good sense to have that option readily available (almost every hosting firm currently has this choice as well).\n\nBasically, you no more require to set-up a server and afterwards incorporate a software application where you can develop your content, separately. It is already rolled into one bundle.\n\nWell … picture if your web server is in your home. If anything were to take place to it in all, all your documents are gone. If something goes wrong with its inner processes, you require a technician to repair it. If something overheats, or breaks down or obtains corrupted … that's no good!\n\nBluehost takes all these headaches away, as well as deals with whatever technical: Pay your web server \"rental fee\", and also they will care for every little thing. And also as soon as you buy the solution, you can after that start concentrating on adding material to your website, or you can put your initiative into your marketing projects.\n\nWhat Provider Do You Get From Bluehost?\n\nBluehost uses a myriad of different services, but the main one is hosting naturally.\n\nThe hosting itself, is of different kinds incidentally. You can rent a common web server, have a dedicated server, or likewise a digital exclusive server.\n\nFor the objective of this Bluehost testimonial, we will concentrate on organizing services as well as various other services, that a blog owner or an online business owner would require, rather than go too deep right into the rabbit hole and speak about the various other services, that are targeted at more skilled people.\n\nWordPress, WordPress PRO, and also e-Commerce— these organizing services are the packages that enable you to hold a web site making use of WordPress and WooCommerce (the latter of which enables you to do e-commerce). After purchasing any of these bundles, you can begin developing your web site with WordPress as your CMS.\n\nDomain Marketplace— you can likewise buy your domain name from Bluehost rather than various other domain name registrars. Doing so will certainly make it less complicated to point your domain name to your host's name web servers, given that you're making use of the same marketplace.\n\nEmail— once you have bought your domain, it makes good sense to likewise get an e-mail address tied to it. As a blog writer or online business owner, you need to practically never use a free e-mail service, like Yahoo! or Gmail. An e-mail similar to this makes you look less than professional.

{"text": "Combining Drapes and Blinds – The Best of Both Worlds\n\nCool breeze in Summer.\n\nI am sure it is not just Liv Tyler who feels that way about the cool breeze streaming in through the window on a hot summer day. It spreads a joyful, pleasant feeling in the room which is quite different from the coolness any artificial gadget, machinery or device can provide.\n\nUnfortunately, with the heat rapidly climbing up the barometer, we have to surrender to air conditioners to remain sane in a city like Sacramento. This is the city that holds the peculiarity of being the sunniest location on earth for three months of the year, from July through September, and can get on your nerves at times! The only consolation comes from the Delta Breeze blowing through the Sacramento – San Joaquin River Delta from the San Francisco Bay, which provides relief by bringing down the night temperatures. If you have a perfectly placed window, you can stand by it and feel the breeze blow on your face.\n\nI am a nature lover and would love to take advantage of the sunlight, cool breeze, and rain as much as possible. They are blessings not to be wasted if you can utilize them. Maximizing my daylight efficiency by allowing diffused sunlight into my home has cut down on my power bills. I also enjoy the cool breeze at night without having to surrender to air conditioning all the time. But there are times when I'm forced to do so to escape the oppressive heat of summer. I do feel some drafts of hot air near my windows, which tells me that there must be gaps that are letting out the cool air from my home, making the air conditioner overwork. High up on my agenda is replacing my window treatments this summer so that I can prevent heat gain or loss from my home. I am a drapery lover, but it's not going to be enough. I plan on combining blinds and drapery for maximum benefits and savings on energy bills.\n\nCombination of window treatments.\n\nGoing through some home decor magazines, I was attracted to the drapery that were hung way above the window, flowing to the floor, giving the room an appearance of height and the window looked larger too. So this was going to be a part of my window treatments for sure. Graber Artisan Pleated Drapery Panels in Creams were available in vast range of fabrics, designs, and styles. The creams looked to be the best option since it complemented my existing decor with its soft and clean tones. I fell in love with its sharp and crisp French pleats. Adding to the benefits, the drapery fabrics would insulate from heat and cold. So, during the summer, maintaining a comfortable temperature in my home was a possibility.\n\nNow, for practical purposes, I decided to opt for durable blinds for my windows. I had the option of choosing either natural wood blinds or the composite blinds. What caught my attention were the Graber Composite Blinds, which had a great visual appeal and functionality. Composite blinds could add the classic, refined look of wood blinds to my windows, especially keeping the climate of my city in mind. Designed not to warp, fade, crack, or peel, these blinds can withstand the rigorous extremities they are going to be exposed to. Perfect for high-humidity areas, I could use them in the kitchen, laundry room, and bathroom windows as well. They are natural and eco-friendly products made from recycled or waste products like sawdust, wood chips or recycled woods that would keep carbon footprint in check. Even though the raw materials are not wholly wood, they look and feel like it. These blinds are simple to use, and the slats are easy to clean since composite slats light. It is made stronger by polymers that also make them moisture-resistant while serving as good insulators. I could also choose to highlight my windows with color-coordinated valances, tassels, cloth tapes, cords and ladders to go with the blinds!\n\nNow that I knew what I wanted for my windows, I chose composite blinds in the arctic white hue, which would also help in combating the summer heat. Though the idea of contrasting these blinds with bright orange drapes crossed my mind, I tossed it aside since bright contrasting colors were not my thing. I preferred my drapes to blend in with my blinds, so I went ahead with my previous choice of cream color.\n\nOnce installed, the combination of blinds and drapes gave the rooms a large, airy feel. I had been uncomfortable with the mismatched shapes of my living room windows. Now, I could create uniformity with ease. I had always complained about the low ceiling of my home, but I had no more reason to complain. Combining blinds with draperies formed cool ambiance in my home, making every room more beautiful, attractive with graceful charm and glamor. I also had multiple options of blocking light, privacy, insulation or allowing some fresh breeze flood in my home.\n\nNow I am not only ready for summer, but also for fog, heat waves, rain or cold winters!", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "4e3cd2cf-3304-4deb-bbee-41dcf70631f6", "url": "https://www.zebrablinds.com/blog/combining-drapes-blinds-best-worlds/"}
{"text": "The Rock's Trusted Transformation Diet & Workout Program\n\nThe Rock has built one of the most muscular physiques in Hollywood!\n\nDwayne \"The Rock\" Johnsonregularly posts his workout videos and epic cheat meals on social media, but his diet and workout program has been a long-kept secret. It changes today.\n\nThe Rock is a force to be reckoned with in the bodybuilding, WWE, film, and tequila industries. Oh, and also, social media. God, how could we forget The Rock's epic Instagram? Let me atone for my sins by taking a shot of Teremana.\n\nDwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson is one of Hollywood's highest-paid actors. Not to mention, I routinely add some spare change to his kitty with my generous drinking habits, but I digress.\n\nIt is no secret that The Rock is a long-time bodybuilding fan. Not only does he have a jacked physique, but he is also always looking at ways to contribute to the sport.\n\nThe Rock was last seen on the Mr. Olympia stage in 2016 when he conferred Phil Heath his sixth Sandow. At the same Olympia, Johnson was presented the \"Man of the Century\" award, a title specially created for him.\n\nThe Hollywood A-lister later announced his own bodybuilding show called \"Athleticon.\" Many experts speculate Johnson's new show would overshadow the prestigious Mr. O.\n\nAs they say, \"with great cash comes great business opportunities.\" Or wait, did it have something to do with power and responsibility? Anyways, I hope you get our point.\n\nThe Rock's Transformation\n\nNow that we are done with The Rock's antiques, let us talk about his physique transformation. It would be safe to say that Johnson was nowhere as big during his wrestling days as he is now.\n\nThe Rock's physique has improved immensely since his Hollywood debut in The Mummy Returns in 2001. He keeps getting better with every movie, both physique-wise and in his acting skills.\n\nJohnson's physique in Pain & Gain arguably made the most headlines. Lately, he has been in the news for his physique in the DC movie Black Adam.\n\nDwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson looks like a total beast in his upcoming movie. He could give pro bodybuilders a run for their money if he decided to compete in a show.\n\nThe Jumanji hero is one of the few A-listers who preach lifting heavy and eating right.\n\nUnlike most of his peers in the film industry, Johnson stays in photoshoot-ready shape throughout the year. He does not take up roles where he has to put on body weight and sport a double chin.\n\nThe Rock has his fair share of haters. While some people like to credit Johnson's wrestling genes for his jacked physique, others accuse him of juicing.\n\nInterestingly, the WWE star found a critique in a rather unusual place. Dan Bilzerian recently stated that it is not healthy to be as big as The Rock. \"The King of Instagram\" was on fire and, without a doubt, raised some eyebrows in his latest podcast.\n\nThe Rock Diet Program\n\nAlthough The Rock is one of the hardest workers in the gym, he does not overlook the importance of eating right. No matter how hard you train, if you are not feeding your muscles the right nutrients, you will not achieve your desired results.\n\n\"Manipulating water, sodium, cardio but also having to push and pull real iron to have dense, dry, detailed muscle. It's real science that takes months and months to dial it all in with my strength & conditioning coach @daverienzi who keeps a very watchful eye, constantly fine-tuning our strategy daily.\" – The Rock on preparing for Black Adam\n\nIf you follow Johnson on Instagram, you probably already know about his insane cheat meals. 12 pancakes with peanut butter and syrup, 6 cookies, a box of donuts, sushi, pasta, bagels, and a giant pizza.\n\nAlthough he does not eat all of that in a single sitting, it would be safe to say Johnson's cheat meals are nothing short of legendary.\n\nBesides his cheat days, The Rock limits his processed food intake. He keeps all the high-calorie food at bay due to its high sugar and refined carb content.\n\nThe Rock Diet Plan\n\nDwayne Johnson follows a \"go big or go home\" approach when it comes to his diet. The Rock switches between two diet plans based on what his role demands.\n\nHe eats seven meals and up to 5,000 calories a day while preparing for physically demanding movies like Hercules and Black Adam. To put this into perspective, that is about twice the number of calories recommended for most men his age.\n\nFor his less intensive roles, he follows a five-meal diet program. So let's get to what The Rock is cookin'.\n\nDwayne Johnson's 5 Meal Diet Program:\n\nMeal 1\n\nMeal 2\n\nMeal 3\n\nMeal 4\n\nMeal 5\n\nDwayne Johnson's 7 Meal Diet Program:\n\nMeal 1\n\nMeal 2\n\nMeal 3\n\nMeal 4\n\nMeal 5\n\nMeal 6\n\nMeal 7\n\nThe Rock's Post Workout Shake\n\nSo you thought Johnson does not gulp down a protein shake after his workout? What you are about to read will blow your mind.\n\nThe Rock consumes one of the most elaborate post-workout shakes we have ever seen. His post-workout shake could make Hercules proud. According to his Instagram, his post-workout smoothie contains:\n\nWe do not know about you, but we feel pretty full after reading about everything The Rock eats in a day. Also, Johnson's diet program is not for someone with seven bucks in their pocket. If you know what we mean.\n\nThe Rock Workout Program\n\nDwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson is no ordinary human. The guy travels with his personal gym. His \"Iron Paradise\" has state-of-the-art equipment with dedicated muscle group training sections.\n\nThe Rock probably has the sickest legs in the film industry. The slabs of meat and vascularity are unlike anything we have seen on a Hollywood A-lister.\n\nThe Rock starts his days with 30-60 minutes of cardio. He then eats his first meal, post which he starts his strength training routine.\n\nJohnson begins his resistance training workouts with 30 minutes of stretching and warming up. The Rock spends more time getting ready for his workouts than most people spend working out.\n\nThe Rock Workout Principles\n\nJohnson's training principles include:\n\n1. High Resistance Training\n\nThe WWE star is a proponent of high-intensity training. He has trained with Mr. Olympia winning coach Hany Rambod and follows the typical bodybuilding training principles including muscle hypertrophy and advanced training principles like dropsets, intraset stretching, and supersets.\n\n2. Go Heavy\n\nThe Rock is one of the few Hollywood stars who lift super heavy in the gym. Unlike most of his A-list peers, Johnson trains for more than aesthetics. He has the strength and endurance to back up his size.\n\nBut at the same time, if you are a Rock fan, this does not give you the green light to lift as heavy as you can without any regard for your form or safety.\n\nThe Rock Workout Plan\n\nThe Baywatch star follows a 6-day training split, focusing on different muscle groups each day. You will be using a plethora of equipment for The Rock's training program, including kettlebells, barbells, dumbbells, machines, and chains.\n\nWithout any further ado, here is what Johnson's training routine looks like:\n\nDay 1: Chest & Upper Body\n\nDay 2: Legs\n\nDay 3: Back & Traps\n\nDay 4: Shoulders & Upper Body\n\nDay 5: Legs\n\nDay 6: Arms & Abs\n\nDay 7: Rest Day\n\nThe Rock Diet & Workout Program Notes\n\nDwayne Johnson is 6 foot 5 and 260 lbs of sheer muscle. If you are a beginner or even an intermediate lifter, following The Rock's training program in its original form would not be a smart decision.\n\nPushing your body's limits with Johnson's training and diet program might sound like the perfect way of shocking your muscles into growing but biting off more than you can chew can put you out of the gym for weeks.\n\nThe Rock is built like a tank. If you have never followed an advanced training program before, you should work with a professional to help you ease into more serious training regimens.\n\nRemember: The Rock's physique is a combination of genetics, hard work, and access to the best food, training equipment, and a team of experts. So, use The Rock's diet and workout program as a guideline instead of following it in its original form.\n\nWrapping It Up\n\nAdopting The Rock diet and workout program is not a matter of access as much as it is a matter of conviction. If you want to transform your physique for the better, get ready to sweat it out in the gym (and the kitchen) for the next six months.\n\nWho do you think has the best physique in Hollywood?

{"text": "BEFORE\nI DIE NEXT YEAR, HE SAID\n\nI\nhave been taking photos since I was twelve. But when asked for pharmacy photos\nI had to answer, no not a one. Little did I know I was just days from being led\nto a drugstore still operating that opened in 1960. That store is the Hamlin Pharmacy\non Staples in Corpus\nChristi Texas.\n\nI have read that the exponential expansion of Walgreen's\nhappened to capitalize on the legality to sell alcohol for medicinal purposes.\nWhether opening new stores was because of the beginning of the \"milkshake\" as\nsome claim, the expansion did take place during and after prohibition. And now\nCVS has built a store across the street from many of Walgreen's. Today's concept\nwith large discount stores that include pharmacies further blurs loyalty between\nthe seller and the buyer of prescription drugs.\n\nVery few people under age\n30 today understand that pharmacies of the past held a position of trust in our\nlives. As a result independent pharmacies were deeply ingrained in our American\nsociety. In earlier times druggists purchased, dispensed and monitored what they\nsold.\n\nAs\na child my parents traveled to Angelina County often to visit kinfolks. On a farm\nnear Lufkin I learned to shoot\nsquirrels with a 22 rifle and hunt quail with a 12-gauge shotgun. Over towards\nPollok was a general store. While\nwandering the medicine aisles of this store I saw boxes of empty capsules (for\nanimal medication). I got the idea that if I put a BB in a capsule I could make\nan imitation MEXICAN JUMPING BEAN. I bought a box of capsules.\n\nBack at\nmy grandmother's farm the idea seemed to work but the BB was visible inside and\nthe capsules needed protection from moisture. Painting with model airplane dope\ntook care of both problems.\n\nI decided this was such a good idea I could\nmake money selling them. I went back to the store, picked up all the capsules\nand tried to buy them. The storeowner said he wouldn't sell all these capsules\nbecause he had farmers with sick animals that needed their medicine too. I was\nembarrassed and put the capsules back on the shelf.\n\nAs\nI walked in the Hamlin store I instinctively went to the pharmacy counter. The\nowner Karl Arnold, a man of my age met me at the end of the counter. We shook\nhands as he explained the store had started small but over time became incrementally\nlarger now totaling 10,000 square feet. The store was now largely miscellaneous\ngift merchandise, \"The money making portion\" Karl said.\n\nHe blew some smoke\nabout what he was going to do with the place \"BEFORE I DIE NEXT YEAR\", he said.\nI realized I was speaking with a man of experience but that doesn't teach you\nthe time of your death. Shocking statements are a good way to understand the personalities\nof people in a first time meeting. I knew right away Karl and I were going to\nenjoy our time together.\n\nHis statement reminded me of Paul Brown a guy\nI knew back in the early 1950's while in the Air Force. After a night of heavy\ndrinking Paul would say, \"Today I have a bad case of polio.\" It would be\nten years before a preventive vaccine for polio, a much-feared disease, would\nbe available. That made his statement and Karl's really dark humor.\n\nI\nmade photos of the prescription medicine storage and dispensing area. Next I moved\nover to the large lunch counter. The soda fountain is a good place to catch up\non gossip as well as having a bowl of chili with a cherry coke. By now Karl had\ndug out a\nbook published in 2000 that included coverage of his store back then. I sat\ndown and perused the book for a few moments. The Hamlin store covered several\npages of the book.\n\nI told Karl about\nmy experience and trust of Balfanz Pharmacy in Houston. And as a child I would\noccasionally be sent on my bicycle to buy a quart of hand-packed ice cream. Later\nas an adult I ate lunch at their counter, usually a sandwich and malted milk.\n\nBalfanz\nwas not listed in this book but the Yale Pharmacy lunch counter was pictured.\nThis was exactly where my mother worked during the last couple of years of the\n1950's. I was overcome with nostalgia and looked for what else the book contained.\n\nThis book COUNTER\nCULTURE TEXAS included Arkey Blue's in Bandera. Arkey's is not pharmacy at\nall, but a place to consume beverages and listen to music. Opening their door\nthe dim light exposes a stairway leading to a lower level. After all Bandera is\nlocated in the hill country. The floor downstairs is covered with sawdust to facilitate\ndancing. That is why \"do it in the sawdust\" is the popular mantra about this establishment.\n\nI\nasked Karl if he had ever been to Arkey Blue's. He shook his head no. I said you\nreally should go there - Karl interrupted - BEFORE I DIE NEXT YEAR, he said.", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "ba46cafc-884d-41d1-8c08-683ac2a743d5", "url": "https://www.texasescapes.com/KenRudine/Before-I-Die-Next-Year.htm"}

{"text": "West Bromwich vs Blackburn. Prediction for the Championship match\n\nWest Bromwich have won their last seven home matches, but whether the bet on the hosts will justify itself in the duel with Blackburn on February 14, the answer is in prediction. How will the teams play?\n\nOur Expert Predictions & Analysis on West Bromwich vs Blackburn\n\nWest Bromwich\n\nWest Bromwich have been extremely unstable this season - the Blackbirds were considered one of the main contenders for promotion, but currently occupy only ninth place in the table. At the same time, there is still a chance to cling to a place in the playoff zone - only two points are missing from the sixth Watford. In the last round, the team of Carlos Corberan lost 0:2 to Birmingham, having suffered a second defeat in the last three rounds of the championship.\n\nBlackburn\n\nBlackburn are having a good season overall, but attempts to gain a foothold in the top six have so far been unsuccessful. The team of Jon-Dal Tomasson is coming to the start of the 31st round on the eighth line in the table with 45 points in the asset, one point behind the playoff zone. In the last round, the \"tramps\" painted a 1-1 draw with \"Watford\", which was their third in a row, and the series without a win reached the mark of four matches.\n\nWest Bromwich vs Blackburn facts\n\nExact score of 3-0 - Blackburn have suffered three of their last nine away defeats by this scoreline;\n\nWest Bromwich to score in the first half - In West Bromwich's last two home games this bet has been successful;\n\nBlackburn won't score - West Bromwich have not conceded in their last seven home games.\n\nGame Totals Prediction\n\nWest Bromwich again made mistakes in recent matches that led to the loss of points. However, in home matches, the Blackbirds show a completely different football, they play aggressively in attack, are quite reliable in defense - a seven-match home winning streak allows them to be listed as favorites. Blackburn are unstable and rather vulnerable in away matches, it is unlikely that the Tramps will be able to cling to points today.\n\nWe believe that the guests have no chance. Prediction - Asian handicap (-1) at West Bromwich. In Mostbet bookmaker, such an outcome is offered with a coefficient of 2.20.\n\nWest Bromwich are very convincing defensively at home, as a series of seven games without conceding a goal is vividly evidenced. Blackbirds need points like air, especially in the confrontation with a direct competitor, so the hosts will definitely go forward, but it is unlikely that they will expose the rear from the first minutes. Blackburn will definitely concentrate on defense, so you should not count on scoring extravaganza in this match.\n\nOur second bet will be under 2.5 goals. In Mostbet, such an outcome is offered with a coefficient of 1.85.", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "72f153b2-42d2-4b95-82cd-e96280a4a552", "url": "https://most-bet.net/1507-west-bromwich-vs-blackburn-prediction-for-the-championship-match.html"}

{"text": "At least in the next life!\n\nThey loved each other. They were together for about a decade. For them, it seemed perfect. Not even in their wild dreams they thought they might see such a day. Story of a couple who made it to marriage and not in life. \"At least in the next life\"\n\nMarried while still studying, having responsibilities, and then having kids. Having dealt with many ups and low's together, a decade happened.\n\nMarried for a decade:\n\n\"Happy anniversary babe. I love you so much. You are the best thing that happened to me and then followed our children and were and are with me in whatever the situation was. You believed in me.\"\n\n\"Happy anniversary to you too, love. 10 years for us is an amazing time to know each other completely inside out! And I am sure we have left all insecurities behind and this is purely us for 'us'. And kids complete me.\"\n\nA conversation, about how they felt first:\n\n\"I remember the day when I first saw you, our arranged marriage set up! Liked you when I saw your photo that came to me. And said Yes, but was not sure how what would you say. I could see my parents were excited and happy that I said yes. I don't know how you felt about me.\"\n\n\"And we got the news that it was a yes from your side, I was happy! My family was waiting for my answer and I casually said let's see. Because I don't want to show how happy I am to get you. And if I do, then a lot of teasing is on my way from friends and cousins.\"\n\nHe continues,\n\n\"I wanted to take time to say yes, but it was a yes for me since the time I saw you. And even now, 10 years later I still feel amazing with you every day. You complete me, I look up to you when I am lost. I discuss with you when I feel low. Not one, not two but everything about you, about me, and about us I love it.\"\n\nHugged cuddles and they made passionate love for their anniversary. Sex was always passionate between then and so did that night. Grateful for life, for my partner, and the children.\n\n— Life is always unpredictable —\n\nAt least in the next life!\n\nThe next few months were pretty normal, just the usual busy schedule kids going to school, husband to work and her taking up freelance projects.\n\nAnd just like that, one day she developed pain in her breasts, when consulted with a doctor, it was confirmed that she had breast cancer and was in the advanced stage almost nothing can be done. They were shattered!\n\nThey felt it was all like yesterday, they got married, have beautiful children, and had an amazing life. But things came crashing upon them. She was put on medication and chemo, and this made her so weak as hell. Kids were growing up and so they knew what was happening.\n\n\"Baby, I guess I won't make it to life, take me out of the hospital I want to spend the last day with you and the children. I know it is a lot to ask given the circumstances. But I can't come out of this, instead, I want moments with you all.\"\n\n\"I will baby, but on one condition, you should be taking your medication and always smiling as this would be your memories for our children throughout their lives. We shall plan up something relaxing and memorable for all of us.\"\n\nThey went home as if nothing can be done, they were sad and the children were crying silently. They were big enough to know what was going around.\n\n\"I will have to make you guys stronger, mom is not liking this, she wants to be with you guys and make the most of her memories. Please try and make this easy for her. I know this is not easy for any of us. But this is what your mom wants.\"\n\nKids eventually change, they smile and be normal in front of and cry at night.\n\n\"Baby, making memories is the best thing you all can give me in my last days. I am smiling more than I normally would. Thank you for everything, I know it's not easy for us to do this way. But this is how I choose to go.\"\n\nAnd a few months later she had her dinner with her family and slept for the rest of her life……\n\nAt least in the next life!\n\nWe were devastated! Broken! Sad! But they had beautiful memories made in the last few months.\n\nThis is making it a bit easy on the family. A person can never be replaced by memories. But it certainly helps.\n\n\"I made memories with my family before I leave them, and was broken inside to know that I won't be around to look at their achievements in life. I won't be able to be with my husband forever.\n\nAt least in the next life!\"\n\nThis story is a part of the \"Storytellers blog hop\" season 3 hosted by MeenalSonal and Ujjwal Mishra for the topic 'Shades of Love'.\n\nThis article is the property of the author Sadvika Kylash (momlifeandlifestyle.com).

Off lately, breast cancer has been consuming a lot of young mothers and it is so devastating for the entire family. But through your story, you have manged to bring out how to be positive and live life cherishing all the moments we get with our loved ones.\n\nDeepika Sharma\n\nLoved the theme of your story. Through sickness and in health, the basic premise of love is set up beautifully. I hope u take it positively, but i found the dialogues a little to mechanical. Though they carried the story more emotions could have been weaved. Also the mixing of tenses made it confusing in parts. However the topic and plot development were spot on.\n\nIt's very difficult to find a compatible partner, someone who shares the dream and someone who makes those dreams come alive. Death can be so final and you have brought that out so well. But the heart always finds a way to hold on.\n\nHarshita Nanda\n\nLife is unpredictable and keep throwing many challenges. But one can sail through the toughest situations through unconditional love and support of friends and family. Your story brings out this thought very beautifully.\n\nA beautiful and heartfelt tale that resonated with me on a humane level. With so many people around suffering from Breast Cancer, this tale highlighted every emotion a family goes through and not only the person suffering from it. Truly heartwarming!\nPS: The tenses in the story jumped and the narrative went from active and passive in a few sentences.\n\nEmotional story. I have also decided that if I have to ever experience any type of 'cancer', I would want to spend my last days with my loved ones rather than in the hospital taking those horrid chemo treatments.\n\nA heartwarming story of a family. It can be especially hard on children to watch their mother melt away. Your story brings our shades of love and courage, especially from the father who is strong so that the children can be strong for their mother.\n\nLove the premise of the story and I get the message of always focusing on the brighter side of life. The writing could be clearer if edited once or twice. Some tenses are confusing but overall, I love the shade of love that you chose to depict through your story 🙂\n\nThe first heart touching moment in this story is when the couple, after a decade of being together, express their love and appreciation for each other on their anniversary. They reminisce about their arranged marriage and how they fell in love over the years. They also express gratitude for their children, who have completed their lives. Their passion and love for each other are evident in their words and actions.\n\nThe second heart touching moment is when the wife is diagnosed with advanced breast cancer and knows she has only a few months to live. Instead of feeling sorry for herself, she decides to make the most of her time with her family and create beautiful memories. She asks her family to be strong and to make her last days happy and memorable. Her positivity and strength during such a difficult time are admirable, and her love for her family shines through in every word and action. Despite the pain and sadness of losing her, the family is grateful for the beautiful memories they created together in her last days.\n\nSuch beautiful yet sad story, couldn't control tears rolling down after she home for last days. I loved how you have described each and every character here so well and how they are deeply in love with each other even after a decade that in an arrange marriage. I could relate to those initial arrange marriage things described here, quiet similar to my own story.

The Houston, Texas musician was being interviewed after releasing his third studio album, Love Sick, at the end of February.\n\nSpeaking to Budden, Toliver explained that West – who has received under much criticism lately – told him that creating something good is about feeling it in your veins. \"Kanye always used to tell me 'If you don't feel it in the veins, it ain't what it need to be' and as soon as you hear it, it has to be something,\" he explained to Budden and co-hosts. Elsewhere, he admitted that he wants success at the next Grammys. \"I need to hold a trophy,\" Toliver said.\n\nNotably, West and Toliver collaborated on the former's 2021 album Donda and the unfinished demo record Donda 2, which was exclusively released on the Stem Player, with four songs made available on February 23, 2022. After working with Kanye, Toliver recalled the experience on Hot 97's Ebro in the Morning: \"That's one of the people in the industry for sure that is transparent with me and I thank God for it, for real\".\n\nTowards the end of last year, Kanye West came under fire for a string of antisemitic comments he made. Ultimately, the rapper found himself banned from social media sites, Twitter, Instagram and Clubhouse because of them. He even appeared on Alex Jones' InfoWars programme to discuss the issue, which proved highly controversial, with him professing his love for Nazi mass murderer Adolf Hitler\".\n\nWest continued: \"But this guy [Hitler] that invented highways and invented the very microphone that I use as a musician, you can't say out loud that this person ever did anything good.\"", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "bb896e1b-365b-411f-90da-96cfc140ca49", "url": "https://hiphophero.com/don-toliver-crucial-advice-kanye-west-gave-him/"}

(Sept. 26, 2013) – Construction has begun on a new Hilton Garden Inn in downtown Louisville, City Properties Group and First Hospitality Group announced Thursday. Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer and Councilman David Tandy joined the developers in breaking ground on the new hotel at the corner of 4th and Chestnut Streets downtown.\n\nAdjacent to the historic Henry Clay building, the Hilton Garden Inn Downtown at Clay Commons will add 162 guest rooms to the popular Clay Commons district. Designed as an eight-story, 121,700-s.f. foot building, the new hotel will feature an open-air rooftop restaurant and bar with unique food and beverage concepts. Construction of the new hotel will occur over a 13-month period with the grand opening planned for October 2014.\n\n\"This new hotel will be a welcome addition to the overall hotel accommodations we offer downtown visitors and specifically a great complement to the growing arts and entertainment scene in that mid-section area of South Fourth,\" Fischer said. \"This project adds to the momentum as we focus on the entire stretch of Fourth St. from the river to Iroquois Park to maximize the investment, the jobs, the retail, educational and cultural opportunities along that critical corridor.\"\n\nThe Clay Commons district, developed around the renovated Henry Clay Building on 3rd Street and the Wright-Taylor Building and Guthrie-Coke Lofts on 4th Street, provides a unique urban experience at the heart of the Theater and Arts District on the southern edge of downtown Louisville. These properties offer residential units, a theater for live performances, restaurants, and catered event spaces with grand ballrooms and meeting rooms restored to their original stunning beauty.\n\nThe Hilton Garden Inn Downtown at Clay Commons, in combination with the Henry Clay, is envisioned as a mini-convention center, connecting support services and overnight room rentals with the event and meeting spaces already in use. Events such as weddings and conferences would be supported by the adjoining hotel, as would the over 275 events and theatre performances currently conducted each year at the Henry Clay.\n\nThe undeveloped property at 4th and Chestnut streets fills out the block. The Hilton Garden Inn Downtown at Clay Commons will complete the corner presence. This prime location is currently underutilized for the Downtown Louisville market. Approximately 300 employees will be engaged by the general contractor and its subcontractors over the course of construction. Once stabilized the hotel will employ more than 40 full-time team members and support staff. The hotel will front the existing PARC parking garage built mid-block, which will provide ample parking to support the 162 guest rooms and 14,000 square foot rooftop restaurant and bar.\n\n\"We are very excited about this project as it will be a great blend of a contemporary and hi-tech hotel with the classic style and history of the Henry Clay, capped off with a very cool roof top bar which will fit in well with the 4th Street vibe,\" said Stephen Schwartz, CEO of First Hospitality Group, Inc. \"It will be a very unique and a special place to stay and play in downtown Louisville.\"\n\nThe Hilton Garden Inn Downtown at Clay Commons is a joint venture between City Properties Group of Louisville and First Hospitality Group of Chicago. In addition to being part of the development team, First Hospitality Group will also be the hotel's operator.\n\n\"I am excited about the opportunity to work with Stephen Schwartz and First Hospitality Group, Inc. because of their focus throughout the Midwest on high impact urban hotel projects,\" commented Bill Weyland, managing director of City Properties Group. \"The insights and professionalism that they bring to the team make this an exciting project for all of our employees and investors.\"", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "e71be683-3760-4c4e-bd62-8db16e9b4d2c", "url": "https://www.lanereport.com/24571/2013/09/new-downtown-louisville-hotel/"}

DH and I have decided to buy them a holiday somewhere nice as a sort of honeymoon-as when they got married they were quite young and had no money so mum just joined dad in austria and germany for a week (he was in RAF after the war)\nWould need to be in jan-so as to be fairly near.\nThey are quite young in outlook and happy to travel. Enjoy sitting round pool/swimming/reading, not mad on beaches. Mum loves shopping (!), like nice food.\nDo you think Dubai (they have been before and loved it) or caribean-have never been to this area-pos more romantic?\nAny other ideas/hotel recommendations? Trying to keep under £1500 for 2. Would love some help as such a big thing and cant ask them as would prefer to be a suprise\n\nmiggy - since it's quite close, why not have a look at lastminute.com, and see what's available and somethng you hadn't thought of might grab your fancy? It sounds as if almost anywhere warm/hot might give them a nice romantic break. Mexico? (never been, it just sounds exciting!) Better check where has a rainy season in Jan too, before booking!\n\nNailpolish-where did you go and why didnt you like it? we have been to jamaica and barbados and liked both but was looking at antigua for my parents. Would be very interested to know where to avoid.\nBlu-have been looking on lastminute-thanks-def have the best prices. Thought Mexico might be a bit too \"exotic\" but dont know much about it-will research it thanks.\n\nNot sure that Jamaica (particularly Negril) is back up and running for tourists after the Hurricane. I thought I'd read that some parts of Jamaica had taken such a battering that it was going to take many months to get things back to scratch.\n\nwe went to jamaica (ochos rios) all inclusive and we went on loads of trips to mountains and waterfalls and the usual stuff but when we left the hotel and walked down the street i was really upset cos of all the poor people (of want of a better word) begging and offering to \"braid hair\" etc just for a few pennies. i was just upset cos of the children etc who were so thin and begging and all the rich americans just stepping over them in the street to get to their souvenir shops.\n\nnailpolish-if you want somewhere with lovely people and caribean weather BUT no poverty, would recommend the Seychelles. We had fab holiday there this summer and was lovely to be in a fab place without feeling guilty about being a tourist.\n11 hr flight so think bit far for my parents though.\n\nI didnt say that there wasnt a need to feel guilty-just reacting to Nailpolish's comment re Jamaica. Some people do find it upsetting to witness poverty first hand, especially as a \"rich\" western tourist. The Seychelles has a very good welfarehousingeducation system and there is no obvious poverty-obv there is, as there is here but not on the scale of Jamaica.\nFWIW I have spent 4 mths in India, travelling and doing some charity work and yes I agree, brings a new meaning to the word poverty.\n\nNailpolish, which resort were you in? We went to Beaches in Ocho Rios and loved it. But seeing the poverty on the drive from the airport was eye-opening to say the least. Don't you think that, as tourism is such a big industry for a lot of Caribbean nations, if those of us who are more fortunate spend our vacation dollars (or pounds!) in these poorer countries that that is doing them some good?\n\nNailpolish - to me that sounds like a good reason not to visit America, rather than not to visit Jamaica!\n\nI think the Seychelles might be out of your budget, Miggy...you might get a cheap deal to Mauritius - not the greatest of shopping (some good markets if you travel away from the hotel, fabrics clothes, Ralph Lauren factory Shops, vanilla pods, great hand made baskets, but no posh shopping) but the local people really do benefit from good employment in the tourist industry.", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "573c2b21-861d-4c20-bb3f-b06ef24a13fc", "url": "https://www.mumsnet.com/talk/holidays/43555-winter-sun-holiday-for-my-parents"}

{"text": "It's simple that superstar energy is the engine that fuels a championship run. Without one or two key drivers, there'll all the time be a ceiling on a staff's doable. In maximum instances, the peak of that ceiling relies on the standard of the drivers themselves. Are their ability units numerous sufficient to lead a staff to the highest? Are their intangibles enough sufficient for them to thrive and continue to exist amid adversity? In different phrases — do they've that \"dawg\" in them?\n\nThe Golden State Warriors undoubtedly have that more or less superstar energy — ability units and intangibles — in spades. Stephen Curry is the principle driving force; Klay Thompson and Draymond Green were the easiest secondary stars at the back of Curry. All 3 of them in combination is a components but to be damaged and voided.\n\nBut for each superstar or staff of stars that experience reached the top of the NBA, at the back of them lies a basis regularly taken as a right — or altogether not noted, for a number of causes. The loss of superstar energy and title popularity apart, this staff regularly does the proverbial yeoman's paintings: make a cross right here, display for anyone there, run to the rim and crash the forums, and many others. The want for them to ranking keeps a undeniable degree of significance, however it's most commonly opportunistic and situational in nature.\n\nEvery iteration of the Warriors' championship-winning groups has relied in this staff to give you the improve the core has wanted: from Mo Speights, Leandro Barbosa, and Shaun Livingston; to JaVale McGee and David West; and the hot identify staff that had Gary Payton II, Otto Porter Jr., and Nemanja Bjelica. All of them have undoubtedly lent credence to the perception that no guy — or on this case, no championship core — is an island.\n\nAll of them have moved on, together with Payton II, Porter Jr., and Bjelica. That is the character of the NBA — key function gamers to find greener pastures, as is their proper. The Warriors are ready of monetary inflexibility; title-fueled sentimentality regularly has to be sacrificed for practicality, which is all the time a difficult tablet to swallow for a staff that intends to contend whilst its core continues to be able to turning in.\n\nWhen one staff leaves, any other should take its position. It's the activity of the entrance place of job to ensure that the incoming staff sustains the improve that its predecessors gave the core. Precedents and requirements — particularly once they are set so excessive — are exhausting to meet. But if any group has confirmed to persistently fit or exceed such requirements, it's the Warriors.\n\nThe staff this is now expected to fit or exceed the ones requirements consist of 2 key offseason signings in Donte DiVincenzo and JaMychal Green.\n\nPreseason is under no circumstances completely predictive of ways the common season will prove, however each DiVincenzo and Green have had noteworthy preseason possessions that portend the type of improve they are going to be offering the Warriors' prolonged core — termed through Kerr because the \"Foundational Six.\"\n\nDonte DiVincenzo: Playmaking and excessive defensive IQ\n\nDiVincenzo is regularly thought to be the Payton II alternative, however there are stark variations that set him with the exception of his predecessor. DiVincenzo post an help charge of 16.1% final season, a profession excessive. Unlike Payton II, DiVincenzo can function a secondary ball-handler who can facilitate a half-court ownership — together with screen-and-roll movements.\n\nThe nifty after-timeout (ATO) play drawn through Kerr above puts DiVincenzo in a super spot to facilitate: \"Zipper Get\" (display for a cutter coming from the baseline to the slot) adopted through \"Chicago\" motion (pindown right into a dribble handoff). Note the location of Jordan Poole at the weak-side wing – his defender hesitates to tag James Wiseman's roll due to the specter of his capturing, whilst DiVincenzo attracts two defenders across the Wiseman display. DiVincenzo then delivers a superbly positioned soar cross to the rolling Wiseman.\n\nIn conventional ball-screen settings, DiVincenzo has confirmed to be relatively adept at discovering his roll-man spouse — whether or not it's on threaded pocket passes or well-timed leap passes over swarming defenders.\n\nInterior passing is definitely inside his strengths as a playmaker. To have a secondary ball-handler who can begin and facilitate is something; to have a secondary ball-handler who can get to the paint with each ft, draw in assist, and cave in defenses inward is an extraordinary luxurious.\n\nAs is expected of anyone who is thought of as the Payton-II alternative, defensive comparisons will inevitably be made. DiVincenzo is a reliable and clever defender, even supposing he would possibly by no means show the similar degree of defensive playmaking that Payton II specialised in. It's extraordinarily tricky to reflect Payton II's plus-3.6 defensive estimated plus-minus (d-EPM) — higher than everybody within the league final season except for for one guy: his now-former teammate, Draymond Green (plus-5.0 d-EPM).\n\nDiVincenzo's way to protection has some notable variations. Whereas Payton II took a number of dangers and used to be extraordinarily handsy, DiVincenzo is extra conservative, however no longer to the purpose the place it hinders his talent to get stops. He turns out to practice simply the correct quantity of force to hound combatants, with a motor this is extremely infectious.\n\nDiVincenzo's less-handsy way is mirrored in his foul charge final season: 2.5 fouls in step with 75 possessions, considerably fewer than Payton II's 4 fouls in step with 75 possessions.\n\nAnother factor to like about DiVincenzo's logo of protection is his total IQ and technology. His popularity of units permits him to calculate and plan his way.\n\nWhen the Washington Wizards run \"Floppy\" (baseline staggered displays on one aspect and a unmarried pindown at the reverse aspect), Corey Kispert chooses to curl across the staggered displays. DiVincenzo acknowledges the set — as an alternative of locking and trailing (i.e., following Kispert and staying shut to his hip), he opts to shoot the space and take a shortcut, effectively denying and slicing off Kispert from the passer. The set due to this fact falls aside.\n\nJaMychal Green: Board guy, spacer, and big-man connector\n\nWhereas DiVincenzo targets to approximate what Payton II produced for the Warriors final season, Green is expected to step into the shoes of Porter Jr. and Bjelica — an influence wing who may just successfully area the ground and crash the forums, and a playmaking huge who may just function a succesful play-connector and passing hub.\n\nPorter Jr.'s effort at the offensive forums extended possessions for the Warriors. It used to be a not unusual sight for him to pop out of nowhere, time his leaps completely, and clutch away defensive rebounds from combatants, as though he used to be all the time on the proper position on the proper time. Having this kind of nostril for the ball isn't a ability that readily grows on bushes.\n\nWhen Porter Jr. made up our minds to signal with the Toronto Raptors, Green used to be signed through the Warriors to exchange the tenacity at the forums that Porter Jr. took with him. When evaluating offensive rebounding charges, Porter Jr. (2.5 offensive rebounds in step with 75 possessions, 6.9 OREB%) and Green (2.8 offensive rebounds in step with 75 possessions, 8.6 OREB%) are remarkably equivalent in that facet.\n\nWhere the numbers display a substantial divergence is in three-point capturing marks. Porter Jr. is a profession 40% marksman on 3.3 makes an attempt for his profession; Green, then again, shoots 36.6% on 2.2 makes an attempt from past the arc for his profession.\n\nDespite the downgrade from a low-volume-high-percentage out of doors shooter to a low-volume-league-average out of doors shooter, Green nonetheless gifts as an affordable knockdown catch-and-shoot operator who will have to obtain a substantial collection of open seems to be. He gained't be tasked to create; as an alternative, he's going to be a beneficiary of advent and benefit era.\n\nWhat stood out particularly about Green, on the other hand, wasn't simply his talent to end possessions off of generated benefits; it used to be his willingness to take part within the technique of benefit advent.\n\nThe Warriors offense supplies numerous alternatives for anyone to create benefits with out being its number one supply; environment displays and slicing into area are examples of such. In Green's case, one explicit ownership in opposition to the Portland Trail Blazers displayed his popularity of a chance and due to this fact performing upon it:\n\nMoody attacking the closeout here's the crowd pleasing section, however what made it conceivable?\n\nRewind again and peep at JaMychal Green environment the flare display for Donte DiVincenzo, which creates the benefit and places the Blazers into rotation. Smart basketball. %.twitter.com/LcvkCEOsqG\n\nIn phrases of being a big-man connector, Green would possibly not warrant the similar more or less alternatives as Bjelica garnered final season, the place he used to be utilized in excessive/low-post movements and as a top-of-the-key distributor in 5-Out \"Delay.\" In a pinch, on the other hand, Green could be a first rate passer in \"Delay\" — whether or not it's discovering off-ball objectives curling round displays, or cutters profiting from overplays/top-locks.\n\nFour preseason video games are a particularly small pattern dimension, however it's under no circumstances non-indicative. It stays to be observed whether or not Green and DiVincenzo can reside up to the lofty expectancies that are regularly expected of Warriors veteran role-players, however the stuff we've observed from them thus far suggests that they're going to play necessary rotation mins within the common season and possibly the playoffs.\n\nThe high quality in their upcoming performances is under no circumstances a make-or-break indicator when it comes to championship potentialities. An intact core will all the time be what determines this staff's probabilities of repeating. But having veterans who outperform their contracts handiest serves to lift such probabilities even upper — and like their predecessors sooner than them, Green and DiVincenzo will have to be motivated to play their hearts out on the lookout for the following huge payday.", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "ffc03ad0-3476-4489-8d30-a57d6af1c788", "url": "https://momentogeek.com/sports-news/veteran-foundation-donte-divincenzo-and-jamychal-green-are-expected-to-fill-enormous-shoes/"}

March 22, 2023—(BUSINESS WIRE)—SkyHive®, a generative AI software company that is helping companies and communities around the world move from job-based to skill-based, is proud to announce that its Founder and CEO, Sean Hinton, has been selected by the Aspen Institute to be part of its prestigious 2023 Henry Crown Fellowship Program. The program, which was established in 1997, includes entrepreneurial leaders such as Aneel Bhusri of Workday, Reed Hastings of Netflix, Reid Hoffman of LinkedIn, and Greylock Partners.\n\nThe Henry Crown Fellowship seeks to develop the next generation of community-spirited leaders. These entrepreneurial leaders have already achieved considerable success in the private sector and are \"looking toward the broader role they might take on in their communities or globally.\" Only a few individuals are chosen each year; the selective process begins with nominations from existing Fellows, members of the Henry Crown Fellowship Board of Overseers, and the Aspen Institute Board of Trustees.\n\n\"I am humbled and honored to be selected for such an esteemed program,\" said Hinton. \"When I found my true purpose, it prompted me to start SkyHive and serve a purpose beyond profits: improving people's lives by reskilling the world. Today, we are already helping countless people, from the private sector to the low-income boroughs of New York, to supporting refugees into employment. This is the impact that gives me my purpose, and I can't wait to collaborate and learn from like-minded luminaries.\"\n\n\"Moving leaders 'beyond success to significance' is what the Henry Crown Fellowship Program is all about,\" said Executive Director of the Henry Crown Fellowship Program, Tonya Hinch. \"Sean is an amazing addition to this year's program. We look forward to his lifetime engagement around legacy and impact as a Henry Crown Fellow.\"\n\nHinton is already a recognized thought leader and innovator in labor economics and the Future of Work, having invented Quantum Labor Analysis® which marries economic theory with artificial intelligence to produce the most advanced real-time knowledge graph of jobs, skills, training, and labor market intelligence in the world. Sean is a World Economic Forum Technology Pioneer, an Unreasonable Fellow, a member of the Young President's Organization (YPO) and serves on the Board of Directors of TECHNATION. He previously served as Co-Chair of the Entrepreneurs Circle of the Canadian American Business Council (CABC) and a member of OECD's Future of Work Forum Engagement Group. In 2020, Hinton was invited by the Government of Canada to join the Global Partnership on Artificial Intelligence (GPAI) and represent Canada as one of the 15 founding countries. GPAI is one of the most extensive collaborations on AI policy and the first international standard for ethical AI. Before founding SkyHive, Hinton led a multinational company with 500 employees and 23 global offices.\n\n‍", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "c63cc680-0b4b-407d-ac09-b3355d0ccf72", "url": "https://www.skyhive.ai/resource/skyhive-founder-and-ceo-sean-hinton-named-a-2023-henry-crown-fellow-3a9b9"}

Avinas reflects both Fabienne's personality and her heritage.\n\nHer jewelry is inspired by bohemian and vintage elements but takes a modern and elegant twist. Each piece is designed to stand the test of time.\n\nFabienne envisages that her pieces can be easily combined with other Avinas jewelry as well as special family heirlooms. Avinas jewelry can transform your look from day to night and work to play, bringing that special touch to your outfit.\n\nFabienne has also drawn on inspiration from different elements of her cultural heritage.

Each piece reflects Fabienne's bohemian touch.\n\nThe Craftsmanship\n\nEach piece of jewelry started its journey as a sketch, before being a tried and tested prototype, worn by Fabienne. Once she is satisfied with the result, this sample will be used to make a mold and a few weeks later it will be included in the collection.\n\nAll Avinas jewelry is marked with the designer's master hallmark F∞F which is registered with the Central Bureau of Precious Metals Control in Bern, Switzerland. This seal is also a guarantee of quality for our customers.\n\nAvinas jewelry is designed in Switzerland and manufactured by different workshops chosen for their reliability and the quality of their production.\n\nThe high quality of Avinas Jewelry is reflected in the choice of materials used to create each piece : Avinas jewelry has a 925 silver base and is then plated with either 18-carat gold or rhodium.

{"text": "Hands on with Polk and Definitive Technology's wireless multi-room speakers\n\nPolk and Definitive technology have been in the speaker-making game for decades. As both companies were launched in part by legendary speaker designer Sandy Gross, both have a storied lineage of producing outstanding, award-winning products. But when it comes to incorporating new technologies, sometimes seasoned speaker companies are slow to catch up. Fortunately for all of us, that's not the case here.\n\nIt should come as no surprise that Polk and Def Tech decided to take on Sonos in the wireless mult-room audio space, but how they've gone about doing it is interesting indeed. Based on the Play-Fi wireless system, both brands' speakers are capable of high-res audio up to 192kHz/24-bit. That means there's no audio file they can't handle.\n\nRecommended Videos\n\nWhile we weren't able to get a close listen to Polk's speakers, we did get some ears-on time with Definitive Technologies, and we can sum up the experience in one word: powerful.\n\nJapanese audio company Denon has revealed a system of three wireless multiroom speakers called Denon Home: The $249 Denon Home 150, $499 Denon Home 250, and the $699 Denon Home 350. Each model is compatible with Denon's HEOS Wi-Fi audio platform and can play hi-res audio files. AirPlay 2 and Bluetooth round out the speakers' wireless connections. The new models will go on sale in the first quarter of 2020, though no specific release date has been shared.\n\nIntriguingly, all three models of Denon Home speakers will come equipped with two microphones for future voice assistant support. However, these microphones will be disabled and not functional until a future software update is available, according to the company. Denon has not yet indicated which voice assistants will be compatible with these new speakers.\n\nEnclave Audio's CineHome Pro is the first THX-certified wireless speaker system\n\n2020 is shaping up to be the year of the wireless home theater thanks to WiSA -- a wireless home theater technology -- and companies like Enclave Audio which is using WiSA to create home theater systems. Enclave's new $1,500 CineHome Pro is one of two new wireless 5.1 systems the company is announcing today and it's also the first wireless 5.1 home theater system to be granted the THX Certification for integrated systems.\n\nThe second system is the $1,000 CineHome II, a slightly less powerful version of the CineHome Pro that is not THX Certified. Both systems come with a full complement of speakers: Two front speakers, a center channel, two surround speakers, and a sub-woofer. Because these are WiSA-certified speakers, they're compatible with any WiSA transmitter. So if you already own an existing WiSA transmitter, you can place these speakers around your living room and have them set up in minutes -- no speaker cables or A/V receiver required. If you don't own a WiSA transmitter, Enclave's CineHub is available as a $100 add-on to either the CineHome Pro or the CineHome II.", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "634e4271-3193-4d43-a07b-241a20237d69", "url": "https://www.digitaltrends.com/home-theater/polk-definitive-technology-wireless-audio/"}

{"text": "Share this story\n\nShareAll sharing options for:What to Do With Ozuna\n\nMarcell Ozuna returned from the injured list over the weekend. That's the good news. The bad news is he didn't really do much, and the Cardinals just finished up getting swept in a two-game set by the Athletics, including flailing away helplessly at Tanner Roark for a whole afternoon. Fantastic. To be fair, Ozuna did draw a couple walks in his first series back, and picked up a hit on Saturday. It's just that when the top five in your lineup go 2-for-18, you're not going to win very many baseball games.\n\nHere's the thing: it's been a little tough to recognise, given how up and down the season has been, not to mention Ozuna missing a good chunk of the season due to breaking two fingers, but Marcell Ozuna is having a really interesting season. Kind of a remarkable season, actually. And the question of what you do with a soon-to-be 29 year old player who is having kind of a remarkable season, when you are in the position of the Cardinals right now, is a fairly fraught one to answer.\n\nIn 2018, Marcell Ozuna turned in a fine season. It was a somewhat strange campaign, but he ended up being worth 2.7 wins above replacement, which is certainly by no means bad. It's not great, not franchise-altering, but it's not bad. It just wasn't what the Cardinals were hoping for when they picked Ozuna up the previous offseason. Plugged into the middle of a Redbird lineup that needed a power-hitting, capital-p Presence, Ozuna put together an odd batting line. He hit .280, which was good, but drew very few walks (6.1%), and hit for very little power (.153 ISO). He made a lot of contact, but seeing your hulking left fielder throwing up the batting profile of a middle infielder is disconcerting, particularly when he was brought in specifically to do damage in key spots. In 2017, the season the Cardinals were hoping to see Ozuna replicate, he hit 37 home runs in 679 plate appearances. In 2018, he hit 23 in 628 trips to the dish.\n\nSo here's the interesting bit: in 2019, Marcell Ozuna is having almost exactly that same season as 2017, the one the Cards were hoping to get. Now, the results haven't been exactly the same — Marcell's wRC+ in 2017 was 144, in 2018 it was 106, and this year it's 118 — but we'll get to that in a moment.\n\nHere are some of Ozuna's key offensive statistics in 2019, compared to his big breakout season of 2017:\n\n2017 BB% — 9.4%\n\n2019 BB% — 9.7%\n\n2017 K% — 21.2%\n\n2019 K% — 20.9%\n\n2017 ISO — .237\n\n2019 ISO — .253\n\n2017 O-Swing% — 34.3%\n\n2019 O-Swing% — 30.9%\n\n2017 FB% — 33.5%\n\n2019 FB% — 38.2%\n\n2017 HR/FB% — 23.4%\n\n2019 HR/FB% — 23.0%\n\nIn most key ways, Ozuna has been either nearly exactly the same hitter this year he was in 2017, or in some cases has been even better. He's put the ball in the air more often. He's chasing pitches out of the zone less often. He's hitting for more power this year than ever before, and his walk rate would be a career high. He's even been a much better baserunner in 2019 than he was two years ago, currently sitting at 2.2 runs added on the bases, versus a -5.2 run rating in 2017.\n\nSo why is it Marcell Ozuna isn't being lauded for his amazing season this year the way he was in 2017? Well, as is so often the case, the culprit is batted-ball luck, or in this case a lack thereof. In 2017, Ozuna posted a .355 batting average on balls in play; this year that figure is .274. It's possible the extra fly balls are causing some of that difference, but not all of it. Ozuna was undoubtedly fortunate on batted balls in 2017, but his career BABIP is also .319, so it would appear there's a decent amount of poor fortune baked into this season's numbers. And when you're getting 80 points worth of batted-ball luck going in the opposite direction, it's going to skew the numbers in one direction or the other.\n\nAll of which leads me to the point of this column, which is to ask what the Cardinals should do with Marcell Ozuna after this season is over. All along, I've felt like it was a simple, straightforward answer: you extend the qualifying offer to Ozuna, he walks away, signs a big contract somewhere else, and you accept your draft pick compensation with dignity and gratitude. The move to bring Ozuna in to anchor your lineup just didn't work, much as many of the other moves you've tried to make over the past several years have not, and the explosion of Christian Yelich into top five player in baseball has really highlighted the fact you settled for the Marlins outfielder you probably wanted least, in order to avoid failing to get any of them.\n\nI will admit, though, that I honestly didn't realise what kind of season Ozuna was putting together this year, which is to say he's been exactly the player you were hoping to acquire back in the winter of '17, only with a little batted-ball luck going against him, rather than offering him an additional tailwind. And that complicates things a bit for me.\n\nIt's also a fact that we've seen once again this year how few sure things there are in the game of baseball. I remember this time last year, Harrison Bader looked like a future all-star, a future sabermetric darling, possibly a future Hall of Fame candidate about whom people waxed poetic the way old Philadelphians do about Richie Ashburn. Or the way a generation of Cardinal fans do Curt Flood. Now Bader is back in Triple A trying to find his swing, and while we can argue about playing time and how he should still be starting regardless, the fact is a 72 wRC+ is tough to stomach, and certainly not getting you into the Hall of Fame, or even the Hall of Really Fast Center Fielders People Like to Reminisce About. Tyler O'Neill has certainly shown promise and some improvement, but he's been a little injury-prone in his big league career, and striking out a third of the time is also tough to stomach, particularly when there aren't that many walks to help drag the OBP up.\n\nSo really, what should the Cardinals do about Marcell Ozuna? Dylan Carlson is on the way, Randy Arozarena is making a very strong case he should be a big leaguer, and the Cardinal farm system seems, as always, to be bursting at the seams with potentially useful outfielders. And yet, over and over again we see guys come up, have some success, and then settle into a middling territory of good player, not great. That's not me taking a shot at the Cardinals' player development staff or the big league coaches, either (no, not even the Mike Matheny era guys); that's just what happens to the vast majority of players. Major league baseball is hard. Being great at it is unbelievably hard. Stephen Piscotty's career path is not an aberration proving the Cards can't develop hitters; he's much more the norm throughout baseball history, a talented player with strong points and weak points, whose overall game ends up somewhere in the middle, and with a fair amount of variation year to year. Stars are the aberration, not the journeymen.\n\nMarcell Ozuna is playing in 2019 like a star. Over a full season, he's on pace right now for about a 3.5ish win season. That's quite good, but it's not otherworldly. If we give him his career average BABIP, though, suddenly his numbers turn into something very different. So he's been outstanding this year. So that's really good to have. So what do you do about Marcell Ozuna?\n\nOzuna will be 29 in 2020, when his new contract begins, wherever that may be. I don't know what kind of length he'll be looking for when he and Scott Boras head into the market, but I'm sure it won't be a short deal. (Editor's Note: Ozuna switched agencies earlier this season, and is no longer a Scott Boras client. The author has been sacked, and the men sent to sack him have been sacked. Hat tip to my old boss at the RFT Tom Finkel for being first in with the correction. — A.) Even in this current climate of free agent freezeouts and collusion talk, a player who has produced nearly 20 wins in his career to date will likely not have to settle for a three-year deal. I can't imagine less than five, maybe longer. I guess four wouldn't be out of the question. But let's say it takes a five-year deal to get him. Ages 29-33. That might not do it, considering this will likely be Ozuna's only chance to really cash in, but we'll go with five years. How eager are you to buy four seasons of Ozuna's 30s? How confident are we he'll keep himself in shape, which has always been at least somewhat of a question with him?\n\nOn the other hand, how confident should we be the Cardinals can replace his production? Then again, do we believe this is now his level of production? This is the player he has been now for two out of the last three years, but the season in between was a strange diversion into an earlier-career version of Ozuna, basically, back when he was thinner, and faster, and a different hitter, but also a center fielder, and not a bad one at that. If he was the same hitter in 2018 that he was in 2017, and that he has been in 2019, it would be easy to buy into the player he is now. But he wasn't, and it isn't. But if Ozuna really does walk off into the sunset, how much uncertainty is left behind in the Cardinal outfield? And given their goal of every-year contention, is that level of uncertainty acceptable?\n\nAll along, I thought I knew what the Cardinals would do about Marcell Ozuna, and what I would do were I in their shoes. But after having seen how things have played out this season, and looking closer at the player Ozuna himself has been, I now have my doubts, if not about my approach then certainly about my level of belief in it.\n\nAnd so, as we head into the home stretch of this maddening, frustrating, occasionally exhilarating season, I think it's worth not assuming we know, but asking the question frankly, and with as little preconception as possible. What do you do with Ozuna?", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "2b564f93-b388-44a0-968a-96c766c3fd4b", "url": "https://www.vivaelbirdos.com/2019/8/5/20754194/what-to-do-with-ozuna"}

Coulter encouraged people seeking a way to take concrete action against President Donald Trump to boycott companies — large and small — that do business with his family.\n\nCoulter has removed any companies that stocked Ivanka Trump products from her boycott list but left a note to remind consumers that these companies failed to drop the brand prior to Trump's announcement that she would be closing the business.\n\nIvanka Trump's line of clothing, shoes, and accessories will continue to be manufactured and sold by the company's licensing partners, a representative for the brand said Tuesday. That means shoppers will continue to be able to purchase Ivanka Trump products at retailers including Lord & Taylor, Dillards, Bloomingdales, Zappos, and Amazon, among others, for at least the next few months.\n\nOver the past two years, Coulter has remained steadfast in her quest to encourage the other 62 retailers, nonprofits, and even a movie produced by Harvey Weinstein to ditch Trump products.", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "b52dd372-42b8-4f57-bcbe-085bcb7d5842", "url": "https://boykotet.com/b/an-anti-trump-movement-is-calling-for-the-boycott-of-these-retailers-932403"}

{"text": "Golden Eagle International, Inc. reported that it has purchased an additional 200 tonne-per-day (tpd) hammer mill for its C Zone gold mill in eastern Bolivia from its Brazilian manufacturer. The Company estimates that the mill will be delivered within the next three weeks based on the manufacturer's representations. The Company has also placed a deposit on a third hammer mill with an additional 200 tpd capacity to permit the manufacturer to finalize fabrication. Once the third hammer mill is installed at the C Zone, the mill will have a capacity of 600 tpd. Golden Eagle's goal is to reach a 2,000 tpd production level at its C Zone operations.\n\nThe Company also announced that it has now completed its concentrate processing laboratory in Santa Cruz, Bolivia, which was the programmed second stage after the C Zone mill construction was concluded. The C Zone operation has now shipped its gold-bearing heavy black sand concentrates from its initial operations to its laboratory in Santa Cruz, Bolivia for final concentration. This procedure ensures the security of the gold contained in the concentrates and allows for better control of the final product due to the remote location of the C Zone mill. Samples of those concentrates have also been sent to a laboratory in La Paz, Bolivia to perform a broad-range analysis to confirm the Company's recoveries and to minimize the possibility of fine gold losses. The Company is awaiting the results of the verification lab to publish its production results to date.\n\nGolden Eagle International, Inc. is a gold and copper exploration and mining company headquartered in Salt Lake City, Utah and with offices also in Santa Cruz, Bolivia. Because the Company has limited financial resources, its efforts have centered on establishing production operations on its gold project on the C Zone within its 136,500 acres (213 square miles) in eastern Bolivia's Precambrian Shield. The Company is also continuing the development of its Buen Futuro A Zone gold and copper project. In addition, Golden Eagle is working to maximize the potential of its Gold Bar 3,500 to 4,500 tpd CIP gold mill located in Eureka, Nevada through a joint venture, toll refining arrangement or potential merger.\n\nThe Company highly recommends that you review its disclosures, risk statements, previous press releases, annual reports, quarterly reports and current reports found at its website: ", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "9332f77d-02df-4c23-9f43-929b31dde6f1", "url": "http://miningtopnews.com/golden-eagle-purchases-additional-equipment-to-expand-c-zone-gold-mill.html"}

That is, if state Republicans change their sentiment on marijuana legalization. The sum would include $60.1 million from the excise tax, $64.9 million from the retail tax, and $41.7 million from the state sales tax.\n\nOfficials unveiled their financial projections following the recent introduction of a measure that seeks to legalize recreational cannabis and possession of up to five ounces of cannabis by adults over 21 and older statewide. The experts looked into trends from the neighboring Illinois and Michigan's burgeoning cannabis markets.\n\nThe legislation, unveiled by Senate Minority Leader Melissa Agard and Rep. Darrin B. Madison in September, seeks to establish a framework for regulated cannabis sales including production and distribution.\n\nYet, Republicans seem to oppose the policy change, even though they gathered this April to design a medical marijuana program that stands a chance of garnering bipartisan support.\n\nIn May, GOP lawmakers killed more than 500 proposals from Governor Tony Evers (D), including a cannabis legalization measure proposals for paid family leave, and funding to renovate the Milwaukee Brewers stadium.\n\nCalifornia Cannabis Festival Skipped For Bigger Milestone\n\nMeanwhile, sources familiar with the matter have confirmed that this year's edition of The Emerald Cup's highly anticipated winter event has been cancelled, reported Marijuana Business Daily. The Emerald Cup honors and unites small craft cannabis farmers in Northern California while facilitating connections with potential buyers throughout the state.\n\nAccording to sources, organizers of the Harvest Ball Festival, which has been attracting more than 13,000 attendees at the Sonoma County Fairgrounds, have decided to skip this year's edition.

In a Q&A with The Lawbook, the lawyers talk more about their work on this pro bono matter and SB 379's significance.\n\nThis week's edition of P.S. features details on a recent scholarship awards luncheon in Houston benefitting Hispanic law students and recognizing several public service pioneers, an upcoming online program hosted by the Dallas Bar Association that will educate the public on the fetanyl crisis at a local level, and September dates for the DBA's DVAP pro bono legal clinics.\n\nAfter weeks of chatter, law firms have officially been roped into the legal battle over corporate diversity hiring initiatives following the aftermath of the SFFA v.

{"text": "Apple faces second FaceTime lawsuit over iPhone 5 and iPad mini\n\nApple faces a second attack on its use of FaceTime, with web software firm VirnetX dragging the Cupertino firm back into the courtroom over video calling tech in the iPhone 5, iPad mini, and other hardware. VirnetX, which scored a $368m win against Apple earlier this week, claims the new smartphone and 7.9-inch tablet – as well as the 4th-gen iPad with Retina display, the 5th-gen iPod touch, and the latest batch of Macs – are just as guilty of infringing its networking-based patents as earlier iOS gadgets.\n\n\"Due to their release dates, these products were not included in the previous lawsuit that concluded with a Jury verdict on November 6, 2012″ VirnetX said in a statement today, explaining its double-dip legal strategy. The company is hoping for damages and injunctive relief; last time around, it sought around $700m, though the judge granted roughly half of that.\n\nFour US patents – Nos. 6,502,135, 7,418,504, 7,921,211 and 7,490,151 – are at the heart of VirnetX's complaint, referring to how VPN connections are established for secure point-to-point communications between devices. In general that technology is used for businesses to share files securely with remote workers, but VirnetX successfully argued that Apple uses the same, patented technology when it establishes FaceTime video calls.\n\nApple, unsurprisingly, argued that the smaller company is chasing cash for something that it didn't create. \"VirnetX is not entitled to money for things they did not invent\" Williams, Morgan & Amerson lawyer Danny Williams said as part of his final closing statement at the last trial. \"The VirnetX technology, if used, is a small part of very large, complex products.\"\n\nNo trial date for the new case has been confirmed, and Apple is yet to comment on the extended allegations", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "f1d6d97c-38d1-45fa-9985-37a12b581397", "url": "https://www.aivanet.com/2012/11/apple-faces-second-facetime-lawsuit-over-iphone-5-and-ipad-mini/"}

Why do those seeking its closure have such a problem with that?\"\n\nIn her Newsnight appearance, Nokes, the MP for Romsey and Southampton North, described members of the public who watch GB News as \"strange\".\n\nShe also took a swipe at Tory MPs for taking second jobs in journalism – a clear attack at parliamentary colleagues including Jacob Rees-Mogg, Lee Anderson, Phillip Davies and Ester McVey.\n\nYesterday, GB News revealed that despite Nokes' demands to have the channel shut down she had actually appeared nine times on the broadcaster herself – including an appearance on the Live Desk just nine days before.\n\nThe register also reveals that Nokes - who has claimed hundreds of thousands of pounds in taxpayer-funded expenses in recent years - regularly enjoys lavish hospitality and freebies from corporate interests.\n\nIn February this year, she accepted a ticket to the Brit Awards and 'hospitality' from Google UK worth a staggering £1,300.\n\nDavid Davis said Nokes' comments were 'alarming'\n\nPA\n\nA month later she bagged two tickets for the Cheltenham Festival, again with corporate hospitality thrown in, worth £700 from Hestview, a subsidiary of Sky Bet.\n\nThe following day, although Parliament was sitting, she was off to the races again, this time tucking into 'food and refreshments' worth £480 courtesy of Jockey Club Racecourses Ltd.\n\nResponding to GB News' request for comment, Nokes said: \"The context of the discussion on Wednesday was around MPs hosting shows.\n\n\"I have never hosted a show on GB News, I have never been interviewed by a fellow MP hosting a show on GB News, I have only ever appeared as an interviewee or a panellist on any television programme.\"", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "e83c092a-b2e3-40dc-97f4-ee632707b07b", "url": "https://www.gbnews.com/politics/caroline-nokes-gb-news-payments-talk-tv"}

{"text": "Sponsor Logos\n\nThe Latest Features\n\nI have enjoyed very, very much your review of the Hegel Music Systems H590, including the comparison to the Hegel H360 and Benchmark Media Systems DAC3 HGC. I have learned a lot. Actually, I am using the H360 with Focal Sopra No1 loudspeakers, mostly through the Benchmark DAC3. Using the DAC3 results in a less edgy sound. I am thinking about upgrading to the H590.\n\nIn your review, you noted that the combination of the H590/DAC3 resulted in a sound close to the sound of the H360. Did you compare the H360/DAC3 combination, and if so, what did you hear? Do you think that the upgrades made to the H590's analog section have resulted in a more refined sound? I understand that the upgrade in the DAC section made an important improvement to [the amp's] sound. Do you think that an upgrade from the H360/DAC3 to H590 will result in a meaningful sound improvement?\n\nI would like to thank you for your excellent and insightful review. I am sincerely obliged having your professional assistance.\n\nMoshe Medioni Israel\n\nFirst up, your questions. No, I did not directly compare the H360/DAC3 combination to the H590. Yes, the H590's amp and preamp are slightly more refined than its counterparts in the H360, but the margins are narrow -- the H360 is a great amp in its own right -- and, yes, I think the majority of the H590's performance improvement over the H360 is down to its DAC. Finally, yes, I do think the H590 will offer a meaningful improvement in sound over an H360/DAC3 tandem.\n\nHowever, as someone who has owned the last three iterations of Hegel's flagship integrated amp-DAC -- the H300, the H360, and now the H590 -- I think that the H590 sounds different than its predecessors. To my ears, there was an eagerness, a forwardness, to the H360 that made that amp exciting to listen to, no matter the source material. The H590 lacks that character, but it gains a lot in the transparency and realism departments. There are times when I miss the H360, but the H590 is clearly a cut above, and I don't have any regrets. My suggestion is to listen to Hegel's new H390 -- the H360's replacement -- if you can. I have a strong suspicion that, if you don't need the additional power, its performance is within a stone's throw of the H590 for a heck of a lot less money. Keep an eye out for Doug Schneider's review of the H390 on SoundStage! Hi-Fi in the next few months. . . .

{"text": "Feature Release: A stellar visitor experience with assigned visits\n\nThe Receptionist for iPad welcomes our newest feature designed to upgrade your visitor experience and ease anxiety at the front desk: visit assignment!\n\nWe built the assigned visits feature primarily for users in the credit union and banking industries, who receive a lot of guests in their lobby that need assistance from an employee but don't necessarily have a meeting scheduled. Our Assigned Visits feature helps those businesses record and queue visitors as they arrive (without making them stand in a physical line) and then allows employees to 'claim' visits from that queue to indicate they were on the way to help and that visitors were seen in the order in which they arrived. This means no more frustrated guests unsure when they will be seen and no more confusion over which employee is helping who! The feature also records crucial data on visit claims in your visit log, including who claimed which individual visit and the time in between a guest checking in and their visit being claimed.\n\nHere's how the assigned visits feature works: first, reach out to our team so that we can make the feature available on your Receptionist for iPad account. Once we've done that, you'll be able to select 'Assign Visits' in the 'Additional Options' section when editing any of your Notification buttons. Then, just turn that on for any check-in notification button where you would want to queue visits and have employees claim them!\n\nThe usual visit notification (via email, Slack, or MS Teams) your team receives when a visitor uses a check-in button with the featured activated will now have a new \"View Details and Claim Visit\" button. After clicking through that link, that employee can go ahead and claim the visitor. Claiming a visit from the notification message doesn't require online user account access, but if a contact has User access, they can also claim a visitor directly from the visit log in your online account admin portal. Once the visit is claimed, the contact who claimed it will be listed in the Contact & Button column of the log as well as in any exported data about the visit.\n\nHeads up: Once someone on your team has claimed a visit, they cannot 'unclaim' it or pass it along to another contact. That specific visit will now be assigned to the contact who claimed it and will have that contact's information associated with them in your visit log.\n\nBecause you control which of your employees is notified on individual check-in buttons, you can make sure alerts for any assigned visits buttons go only to the employees who would typically help out new guests — like sales or customer support. This feature is available on individual check-in buttons, so your business can have one check-in workflow for known or returning guests who might already know who they are there to see and another button for new visitors that will need someone to come grab them.\n\nBeyond giving your team clarity on visitors that still need assistance and preventing confusion on who should be helping who, turning on the assigned visits feature provides valuable and exportable data on how your team is supporting customers. Beyond the number of visits claimed by each employee, The Receptionist for iPad also keeps track of when a visitor checks in and when their visit is assigned to an employee. This block of time helps you know just how long customers are waiting in your lobby for help. You'll have insight into certain days or time periods where that delay stretches beyond an acceptable limit and can adjust staffing decisions or procedures accordingly. The metric can also be a crucial data point for companies expected to maintain an SLA with their customers and ensure everyone gets help in a timely manner.\n\nIf you have questions about our newest feature or want us to activate it on your account, don't hesitate to reach out! You can find us anytime using our live chat feature from the orange button in the bottom-right of your admin portal. You can also send us an email at [email protected], or call us directly at 888-315-5230. Even if you're already dreaming of all the magic assigned visits could create at your front desk, we'd love to hear about your", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "698e2386-c648-4f56-8ed4-ce323a091d93", "url": "https://thereceptionist.com/blog/assign-visits-release/"}

{"text": "Snow joke as we get ready to face Man City again\n\nMorning all from a very cold and quite snowy Dublin. I know many of you live in places where cold and snow is the norm, but such has been the media frenzy about this temporary spell of cold weather we're having, that there's been end of days panic across the nation.\n\nSupermarkets are out of bread, shelves are empty of all kinds of food, and it's all a bit mad. It's just some snow, like. Regular snow. Not evil snow. Or poison snow. Or zombie snow that makes snowmen come to life and do unspeakable things to you with their coal-dead eyes or carrot nose.\n\nApparently, according to some stories, Man City are risking Thursday night's game by only travelling to London on Thursday and with the weather the way it is they might not make it. I guess I can see how that would happen. A light dusting of snow in this part of the world brings everything to a halt.\n\n\"Sorry, can't come to work today.\"\n\n\"Why not?\"\n\n\"There were eight flakes of snow, and I'm scared.\"\n\nPublic transport is also seriously affected as these eight flakes may make roads etc impassable. In truth, it would be a surprise if the game was at risk though, but if they didn't make it we would, apparently, be awarded a 3-0 win. Like when you get too many players sent off in a game of FIFA, but without the fun of getting too many players sent off.\n\nIt would also save us another game against City who, frankly, are about the last opposition I'd want to face at this moment in time. Having lost a final to them on Sunday, what we really need is a game against one of those teams we play quite well against. A mid-table outfit who come to our place and probably fancy their chances because of our form but being the mad team we are we actually play quite well, win by a couple or three goals (after conceding first), and the game acts as a kind of unguent to our increasingly festering wounds.\n\nInstead, we've got to play a team who know they've got the measure of us, who didn't have to play that well to beat us in a final, and who will probably be even more confident to have a go at us in a competition in which our motivation is probably even lower than it was on Sunday because of the league table:\n\nArsene Wenger will meet the press this morning ahead of the game, and it'll be interesting to see what kind of response he's hoping to elicit from his team. I'm sure we'll hear the usual stuff about having to refocus and concentrate on the next game, but I'm genuinely curious as to how he's going to try and get more from his team tomorrow than he did at Wembley.\n\nThere's not huge scope for rotation. It's not as if via the Europa League and League Cup matches we've created a competitive squad with players who are chomping at the bit for a place in the 'first team'. This two tier group of players means the manager has to try and fashion a performance from more or less the same lot who couldn't do it on Sunday in the Carabao Cup final.\n\nIt also feels kind of inevitable that he'll be asked about that leaked list of potential replacements, which could be kind of awkward. Nevertheless, when you're a manager whose team is struggling for form, is falling well short of where it wants to be in the Premier League, and has lost six games in 2018 to the likes of Nottingham Forest, Ostersund, Swansea and Bournemouth, you should expect some questions about your future.\n\nEspecially when you're a manager who has been in charge of a club for as long as Arsene has and when there's been such intense speculation about what's going to happen over the last little while. As I said yesterday though, I do hope that whatever goes down, things are done in the right way and remain as respectful as possible.\n\nThe very fact that this 'leak' emerged so soon after the final on Sunday is telling in itself. The conversation is no longer about 'if' but 'when', and how it plays out between now and May is entirely dependent on what happens on the pitch. And look, this shouldn't absolve the players of their responsibilities either. The manager might be struggling but it doesn't give them an excuse for lack of effort or organisation or the pathetic, feeble defending we saw at Wembley.\n\nIt's not enjoyable in any way to see the team like this, to endure these results and performances, or to see Arsene Wenger under such relentless pressure and criticism, but nor should we be blind to the problems we have. They won't be solved entirely by a few good results, but they'd certainly help, and I think we could all use that.\n\n—\n\nFinally for today, huge thanks to everyone who has supported the site after our launch on Patreon yesterday – you can read all about that here. The response has been incredible and it's so heartening to see that the way we look at online media has changed. A few years ago the idea of paying for content, or supporting publishers/creators etc, would have been almost fanciful.\n\nNow, there's been a shift in the way we think and it's a real positive. There are podcasts and publications that I pay for each month because I enjoy what they do, and how they do it. It's been helped by platforms like Patreon which make it easier for us to do that, but there's definitely been a real change in how we think about the media/content we consume.\n\nIf you want to get on board, you can sign up on our Patreon page, and we have a full FAQ here if you have any problems. The extra content you get immediately includes a two part podcast about the Invincibles season, a chat with Tim Wheeler from the rock band Ash, and long-read article from Tim Stillman about a Friday night Arsenal won the league on goal difference.\n\nAgain, thank you all so much, and for the birthday wishes yesterday. We'll have team news and everything else from the press conference over on Arseblog News throughout the day as we go into year 17", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "7a636a8e-6e85-42e4-bd78-f4682e9c416e", "url": "https://arseblog.com/2018/02/snow-joke-as-we-get-ready-to-face-man-city-again/"}

{"text": "\n\n\n\nDivorce is a massive action, as well as how it's dealt with can have long-term influence on the remainder of your life. Regardless of which side you get on, it's wise to look for seasoned lawful depiction. If you've never been divorced previously, the process might feel terrifying as well as unpleasant, so before employing a separation attorney, you should do your research to ensure you're obtaining the best for your situation. For instance, if you or your soon-to-be-ex remain in the armed forces, make certain that you don't hire a separation attorney with no experience in military divorce. In other words, you require a divorce lawyer who focuses on what makes your life distinct to you.\n\nAsk the questions you need to ask to see to it an attorney can manage your certain separation instance. If the procedure of hiring a divorce lawyer is overwhelming and also a little bit frightening at this moment, consider this list of 26 inquiries your go-to overview.\n\nThe amount of divorce instances have you handled?\n\nEmploying a divorce lawyer is kind of like choosing a medical professional to do surgery: You don't intend to employ somebody that's never ever done this previously. Obtaining a separation is demanding sufficient, and the last point you'll wish to need to do on top of handling the emotional and also logistical consequences is checking your lawyer's job over their shoulder to make sure they are handling everything appropriately. Besides, you're the customer.\n\nThe amount of those situations were you able to resolve out of court?\n\nIdeally, you wish to maintain your separation out of the courts to avoid included dramatization as well as a long term contract. Clearing up out of court is basically reaching a compromise, so finding on your own a skilled divorce attorney that's resolved out of court a whole lot is an excellent sign to try to find.\n\nDo you exercise collective divorce?\n\nSimilar to settling out of court, a collaborative separation puts the \"allow's combat!\" attitude away to ensure that you and also your partner can get to a practical contract in a non-aggressive means. It's a kind of problem-solving that keeps the peace throughout a separation. A collaborative separation could finish with you and also your ex on good enough terms to be pleasant with each other.\n\nWhile maintaining your separation out of the courts might sound suitable, you might need to take it to test. If your partner is a bully or has a combative individuality, points may leave hand, as well as because of that, the courts could keep him or her in check.\n\nDo you recognize my spouse?\n\nIf your lawyer is connected with your partner, that might be a big issue despite just how your attorney feels regarding him or her. Our very own individual feelings or knowledge of one more person tends to get in the way of our capability to execute without bias, so certainly do not hire someone that has any type of prior link to your spouse.\n\nDo you recognize my spouse's attorney?\n\nWhether or not your legal representative recognizes your spouse's attorney might matter to you much less than if your lawyer understands your spouse, yet it's still something to think about. If they were in one workshop together throughout their very first year of legislation institution, do not hesitate to wage your legal representative, yet if they were roommates in regulation school, you may intend to take into consideration hiring someone else.\n\nAre you familiar with regional family court judges?\n\nBefore enrolling in an university class, you possibly asked a few various other trainees what the teacher resembles, just how they grade, and what their position of tardiness is, and so on. Hiring an attorney is similar because, prior to you do so, you wish to make sure they know your neighborhood courts' track records and directions in which they often tend to rule. If the judge appointed to your instance has a tendency to be lax with protection as well as you're seeking sole protection, you'll desire your attorney to be aware of this to make sure that she can intend a strong approach.\n\nDo you believe it is far better to mediate as well as negotiate than most likely to trial?\n\nThe most vital element when it involves hiring a divorce attorney is that you see eye-to-eye. If you want to mediate and also negotiate, yet your legal representative is dead-set on mosting likely to test, that disagreement might impact your situation's success.\n\nDo you have experience negotiating financial support or negotiations?\n\nFor instance, youngster or spousal assistance, large financial negotiations, or business valuation are all bound ahead up in any separation case including children or organizations, so you intend to ensure your attorney recognizes what they are doing.\n\nWill you or another attorney from the company be managing my case?\n\nYou employ a specific lawyer because you concur with their method of doing things, so the last thing you desire is for your case to be handed off to other legal representatives in the company.\n\nBefore you hire someone, make sure that they will certainly be with you from beginning to end.\n\nCan I fulfill anybody else that will be involved in managing my instance?\n\nIf your instance is made complex and requires to be looked after and also dealt with by several individuals, make certain you get to satisfy anyone who will certainly be included for the very same reason you consulted with your primary lawyer. Your future is in their hands, in such a way, so being familiarized with everybody that will be servicing your situation is absolutely vital.\n\nAre you available using phone or email?\n\nDivorces are not a one-and-done type of situation, so if something urgent shows up and you do not seem like you can wait up until your next set up appointment to share it with your lawyer, you will intend to be able to connect with him or her on the phone or by email. An additional concern to ask is whether you'll be billed for this communication.\n\nDo you have a hefty instance lots?\n\nIf your attorney is managing a great deal of various cases, they might not have the time to be as devoted to your own as they should. Your divorce is widely essential, so ensure your attorney has the moment to give it the interest it is worthy of prior to signing anything.\n\nWill I obtain duplicates of records submitted with the court?\n\nWe have actually all listened to the phrase \"on the document,\" which is essential in any legal battles due to the fact that you may need to describe a record or discussion for your situation. If you believe it will be essential, make sure that all communication with your partner's attorney and also any kind of other records connected to your case will certainly end up in your hands if you need.\n\nWill I be kept educated of all growths in my case?\n\nYou can make a decision how involved you intend to be when it involves your separation proceedings. Some individuals might want to be informed of every single developing information, while others like to be maintained in the loophole on just the bigger things. If you locate yourself in the former category, make certain your lawyer will be offered as well as going to share info with you.\n\nWill you ask my viewpoint before intending a method?\n\nSimilar to being informed of any type of developments in your situation, whether you intend to be oriented on your lawyer's method is totally approximately you. Just make sure that you as well as your lawyer get on the same web page before you turn over the retainer.\n\nWhat are your personal feelings about joint guardianship versus single custodianship?\n\nSome individuals aren't totally certain how they really feel about big, life-impacting choices like joint versus sole safekeeping of their kids, so having a professional weigh-in can aid them make a decision. Nevertheless, the attorneys have actually done this greater than you have, so they can present some helpful info on what enters into protection arrangements and which sort of plan might be best for you and your kids.\n\nWhat is your retainer charge?\n\nYour legal representative will probably offer this information without you needing to ask due to the fact that they intend to be sure you can afford their solutions before they put way too much initiative right into your situation. Nevertheless, just in situation, get this inquiry off the beaten track early on.\n\nWhat is your hourly payment rate?\n\nLike tutors and also therapists, the majority of legal representatives bill by the hr, so ensure you recognize what you're entering monetarily prior to authorizing anything. You may have the ability to easily spend for the retainer fee, however not the per hour rate, so make certain you request for an overall price break down.\n\nDo any type of charges I pay include the solutions of any type of other partners?\n\nIf your key attorney isn't the only lawyer dealing with your instance, you might additionally be spending for other associates' time. While this is fairly usual, knowing what you're paying for might relieve your mind a bit.\n\nIf my case mosts likely to divorce court, will there be added costs?\n\nEvery firm has different policies when it comes to going to court. It's not uncommon for extra charges to be tacked on if your instance does litigate.\n\nWill I sign an agreement laying out the fee arrangement?\n\nEvery person has their very own sensations about signing a cost arrangement agreement, but we have a tendency to think it's an excellent concept. If you worked with an excellent legal representative, she or he likely would not be attempting to squeeze you for every single cent you have, but simply in instance, making sure every buck you invest is accounted for is constantly a wise action. A charge setup essentially implies that your attorney won't start charging you for additional solutions when you turn over a retainer as well as sign a contract with him or her.\n\nWill I be sent made a list of expenses?\n\nSimilar to checks at a restaurant, itemized expenses outline precisely what you're paying for. Whether you want among these is entirely as much as you.\n\nWill I be updated on just how the retainer cost is utilized as well as when it is used up?\n\nThis is absolutely something you need to discuss with your lawyer prior to employing them since while some lawyers consider a retainer like a down payment, others will add an additional retainer if you use your original up before the instance is shut. This does not matter to some people, yet if it does to you, make sure to bring it up early.\n\nWill you petition the court for my spouse to pay my lawyer costs?\n\nIf you are financially based on your soon-to-be-ex, you might intend to take into consideration finding an attorney that will certainly request the court for your spouse to pay for their solutions. This essentially suggests you have a fair test or joint separation.", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "e2744202-28b0-4b22-a2b5-7669b6a8bf7f", "url": "https://a1roofingstlouis.com/https-www-nylawyersteam-com-family-law-attorney-locations-brooklyn/"}

{"text": "Pages\n\nJOURNAL\n\nSeptember 1st 2023, Friday\n\nWe can always say that some things never change, but the truth of the matter is that they do. Not in an expected way though.\n\nLast week I had to learn how to open up my slim PS4 so that I could remove a tiny round plastic toy my son jokingly inserted into the disc drive. At least we noticed what he had just done, so nobody tried to run any disc on it afterwards.\n\nAnd here's the young offender, just a few minutes prior to committing his crime:\n\nBeing extra careful is what we can actually do from now on, besides hoping he grows up a little so that he can start playing some games with me instead. Taking the PS4 apart wasn't that hard in the end, and I even got to try out GG Aleste II just for the sake of verifying if the console still worked.\n\nYes, that's the state of the mess at the moment. This is what a real gamer's room looks like, not that fancy neat stuff you always see in Instagram. Moving things back and forth from boxes to shelves and vice-versa takes precious time that I'd much rather spend playing.\n\nAnyway.\n\nStage 1 (3 in the game) is almost nailed down completely, now moving on with practice in stage 2 (2 in the game, duh!!).\n\nOne of the challenges is dealing with unexpected loading cycles of the sword, which can totally mess up your main strategy.\n\nMarch 21st 2023, Tuesday\n\nAs you might have noticed, things around here have been a little slow in 2023.\n\nPart of it is my own fault, part of it isn't. A couple of weeks ago I was really warming up to Detana!! TwinBee, for example, after playing it on MAME a few times. However, when I tried to run the Playstation disc to give the game some serious love I had two nasty surprises. The first one was the realization that that this port doesn't have a TATE mode, which shocked me somewhat. And the second one was that my console wasn't giving out any audio. I retightened and changed cables but the problem persisted, so yesterday I sent it out to console hospital for a full check-up and recovery – along with my NES, which has been flimsy for months now and just refused to work as I was about to have real fun with Burai Fighter.\n\nCould I have gone to Detana!! on the Saturn? Yes, of course. But Radiant Silvergun is there waiting for me and I won't take it out any time soon even though I haven't given it proper love. I could blame it on available time or whatever, but the truth is that I lacked the stamina to invest what's needed to actually learn how to properly play the game. So I diverted to other titles with easier absorption prospects, a condition that's about to change, or at least I feel is about to change.", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "105a8514-1c3a-45a4-aca2-c7fcf602a799", "url": "https://1cclog.blogspot.com/p/journal_21.html"}

She looks so cute just chillin' on her lilypad.\n\nI colored her with my Copics but didn't have the right pink in my collection. So as an alternative, I used the pinks from the BIC Mark-It Permanent Markers 24 Assorted Mix. They blended beautifully. For the water, I used some green and blue shimmer chalks. Using Liquid Pearls in White Opal, I gave her a pearl headband. With a few taps on the back of the card while the pearls are wet, it flattens the peaks of the liquid.\n\nThe flower is from Petaloo Burlap Blossoms - Pistachio. It went well with the beachy theme.

Come the day when you have to start turning the heating on to warm your home, that once welcome draught will quickly turn into a curse as you feel the chill causing your heating system to kick in and you watch your gas/ electric meter readings steadily climbing.\n\nFor all of those lucky individuals who have already installed a new Composite front door from Timber Composite Door a door chosen from the excellent Solidor range you can stop reading now, because you will already know that once your new Solidor is closed, its closed, fully draught proofed so no draughts and with a solid hardwood timber core and glazed panels that are always double glazed, you have installed one of the most thermally efficient doors currently available.\n\nIf the cry of \"shut that door\" persists in a household with a new Composite front door from Timber Composite Door the problem will not be the door it will most definitely be a family member or pet as the cause and they can all be trained to close doors. However, for those of you who have not acquired a new Composite front door from Timber Composite Door the problem could be different maybe before the weather changes it is a good time to take a good look at your existing front door and ask yourself the following –\n\nIs it draughtproofed and if so does it look like it works or is it all worn and tired looking?\n\nDoes your door sit square in the frame or is it all warped and twisted?\n\nAre the glazed panels single or double glazed and what about that cracked pane?\n\nIs your frame still solidly connected to the wall and sealed all around or does it just sort of \"fit where it touches\" leaving air gaps all around?\n\nDoes your letterbox still have a flap and does it actually close?\n\nIf your door suffers from any of the above the cry of \"shut that door\" is going to be heard rather a lot in your household this winter and the most unfortunate consequence of any of the above is that even with your door firmly shut you are not going to stop those draughts and that is definitely going to cost you more money on heating bills – lots of it.\n\nThe good news is that your coming winter does not have to be a tale of cold, misery and expense – there are no special requirements needed to purchase a new Composite front door from Timber Composite Door all it takes is a visit to our web site (and we have included lots of links in this article) check out all the styles colours and accessories – design the door of your choice, select our 0% finance deal if you require it and our installation service anywhere throughout the UK is highly recommended – follow the easy to navigate \"user friendly\" instructions and you could have a new Composite front door from Timber Composite Door installed within a matter of weeks", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "85985a39-b6a2-4fa0-a274-044afab69676", "url": "https://www.timbercompositedoors.com/blog/shut-that-door/"}

A petition regarding Belle Gibson has just gone live. Started tonight by Stefanie Spinks, after the '60 Minutes' Belle Gibson interview by Tara Brown, here is what she says:\n\nBelle Gibson is playing us for fools - she fed us false claims of cancer survival, a neglected childhood and the healing powers of organic foods. Now she continues to obtain money off her fraudulent lies - with 60 minutes paying her a reported $45,000 in an interview to air this Sunday.\n\nCountless loved ones have lost their lives to cancer - having fought their honest battle with legitimate grace. But Belle Gibson was a fake who took our honest money to hear her \"inspiring story\", promising $300,000 would be donated to cancer charities - but not one charity received a cent from her.\n\nWhat's more Belle has managed to avoid being charged by the Victorian Police and now continues to make money off the back of her dishonesty & fraud. It just disgusts me - to promote herself on this falsehood is unthinkable, hurtful and deeply offensive to legitimate cancer sufferers.\n\nBy accepting $45,000 for her interview, Belle is sending the message that people can profit off stealing, lying and taking advantage of peoples good intentions.\n\nBelle, it may be impossible for you to undo the damage your lies created, but you can certainly start at charity donations.

This enables our DevOps clients to make tremendous changes to the way their architecture is set up, analyzed, and developed while remaining adaptive to insights, opportunities, or problems that might be uncovered during the process of evolving client processes and architecture. Ultimately, Thoughtworks empowers our clients to confidently manage developers across multiple teams working in concert while maintaining operational best practices, security, agility and an efficient CI/CD development cycle.\n\nOften the most effective way to actualize this is through the use of AWS services that simplify provisioning infrastructure, automating software release processes, and monitoring for tracking performance and identifying opportunities for improvement. In some cases, a hybrid approach is called for whereby AWS services and other third party solutions are applied together in order to provide for a more seamless transition as systems evolve or to work around legacy constraints. The AWS suite adapts well to these situations and allows for a graduated and flexible transition to the AWS cloud that can move at the pace called for by business needs.\n\nFor any DevOps transformation to create sustainable improvements, changes in tooling and process must be matched by growth in a strong DevOps culture within the client company's developer community. Thoughtworks is uniquely positioned to provide for this need as a consultancy with strong experience in enablement, continued education, and curriculum development. Thoughtworks teams work to understand the current client developer culture and work together with account leadership to identify opportunities to share insight, run internal trainings, and workshop new strategies and ways of working while maintaining momentum in development", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "f2710998-a1da-4132-bc07-50e8e2de1cee", "url": "https://www.thoughtworks.com/en-au/about-us/partnerships/cloud/aws/dev-ops"}

College of Physicians\n\nA woman posing as a doctor known online as \"Dr. Lipjob\" is at the centre of an investigation after allegedly performing cosmetic injections illegally.\n\nIn a court order initiated by the College of Physicians and Surgeons British Columbia (CPSBC), Rajdeep Kaur Khakh reportedly bought medical products and performed Botox and dermal filler injections using a forged medical license.\n\nReferring to herself as Dr. Rajji and Dr. R.K., Kaur had convinced several salons and spas she was a doctor, until she became the subject of a year-long under cover investigation conducted by the college.\n\nAccording to the CBC, Khakh had agreed to stop performing procedures in March under the terms of a consent order, but continued administering injectables to people in their cars and homes and at private botox parties.\n\nIn a sworn affidavit, Justin Voitic, a Vancouver salon manager and blogger, says he was contacted by Khakh in 2017 through Facebook, saying she was looking to grow her male client base and referred to herself as Dr. R.K.\n\nVoitic says he was offered free injections of dermal fillers in exchange for Khakh filming the procedures and sharing on Instagram. Khahk reportedly told him she had experience performing injections out of her clients homes.\n\nVoitic agreed, and received lip fillers from the woman who dubbed herself \"Dr. Lipjob.\"\n\nImage via Getty Images.\n\n\"It was very painful,\" Voitic said in his affidavit. \"I felt that my lips looked swollen and awful the next day.\" Eventually the swelling subsided and he felt his lips began to look \"more normal.\"\n\nVoitic says he came across a CBC article about a woman posing as a doctor known as \"Dr. Lipjob\" and immediately recognized the woman as the person who had injected him with lip fillers.\n\nIt wasn't until July of this year, that Voitic confronted the fraudulent doctor when he arrived at the salon he manages to find Khakh in the middle of a private Botox party that was organized by another employee.\n\n\"I showed her the article, said to her and everyone present that she was not a real doctor and demanded that she leave immediately before I called the police,\" the affidavit reveals. \"[She] appeared shaken up and quickly packed up her things… She thanked me, which I assume was for giving her the opportunity to leave.\"\n\nImage via Getty Images.\n\nIn a new application by the CPSBC, the college alleges that Khakh's \"contemptuous conduct is financially motivated\" noting that affidavits from witnesses say she was charging considerably less than licensed professionals, at $300 and $420 per treatment.\n\nThe CPSBC is now asking for Khakh to receive jail time in addition to being fined for continuing to operate illegally, and not informing her clients that she was prohibited by law from practicing medicine", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "120d0c40-632a-435f-a91c-8140dfd49ca7", "url": "https://ca.style.yahoo.com/woman-known-dr-lipjob-performed-illegal-botox-injections-b-c-college-physicians-190929227.html"}

{"text": "Terms and Conditions\n\nThe placing of a bid by any means shall constitute the acceptance of these Terms and Conditions.\n\nAll bids are conducted in Canadian dollars. The buyer shall pay a commission of 17% on the hammer price of all lots won. Canadian buyers will be charged applicable tax(es). British Columbia merchants can provide us with a provincial sales tax exemption number.\n\nAll lots will be sold to the highest bidder, at one increment over the next highest bid. In case of dispute, the auctioneer's bid book will take precedence over any other source.\n\nAll bids are per lot as numbered in the catalogue, and Garden City Philatelic Auctions Inc. (GCPA) reserves the right to withdraw any lot prior to the sale for any reason, as well as to refuse a bid, if it is deemed not to be made in good faith.\n\nAll lots remain the property of GCPA on behalf of the consignors until paid for in full.\n\nUnless there is prior arrangement with the Auction Manager, all payments are due 30 days after invoice date, and can be remitted in one of many ways (see the \"Payments\" page on our website for more details). A 2% per month fee will be changed on delinquent balances until the full amount has been paid, and late payers agree to pay all fees incurred by GCPA to recover the money owed.\n\nThe buyer is responsible for the insurance and delivery of their purchased lots, and will be charged actual shipping costs. Proof of mailing shall constitute delivery. GCPA will use the least expensive and most secure shipping method, unless the buyer expresses a preference at purchase time, preferably before invoicing has been sent. Purchases will be mailed only once payment has been received unless prior arrangement has been made. Buyers outside Canada are responsible for all customs duties applied by their home country, and GCPA will not modify invoices for the purpose of avoiding such fees, which are rare.\n\nEach lot is sold as genuine and is described to the best of our knowledge and opinion. A lot cannot be returned if it meets any of the following criteria:\n\nIt contains 10 or more stamps or items.\n\nIt is pictured online and a fault can clearly be seen (bidders who have not seen the material in person are responsible to carefully view our high quality online scans before bidding).\n\nIt has been described as including faults or other problems.\n\nIt is described as \"as is\" or \"mixed quality\" or the word \"appearing\" is used following an adjective, such as \"fine appearing\".\n\nIt is accompanied by a certificate from a recognised entity dated 7 years or less.\n\nIt has been viewed in person by the buyer in advance of the auction.\n\nIf a discrepancy in a lot description has been discovered before it is auctioned, GCPA will post a description of the discrepancy on the GCPA website and announce it verbally at time of auction. It is the buyer's responsibility to be aware of this before bidding.\n\nLots can be returned only if they are incorrectly described, within 14 days of receipt, by first contacting us with the details of the problem, and then sending it to us in its original packaging by registered mail. If an extension is requested, the 14-day time limit will be extended.\n\nBuyers can ask for an external opinion on a lot won (called an extension), by an authority known to us, as long as all of the following criteria are met.\n\nThe request must be made to GCPA before invoicing of the lot\n\nPayment of both the lot and its certificate fees must be made in full before GCPA will send it directly to one of the approved authorities listed below (a refund will be issued in the event of an unfavourable opinion)\n\nThe following are GCPA approved authorities: the Vincent Greene Foundation (Canada and BNA), the Philatelic Foundation (USA and worldwide) and the BPA or RPSL (British Commonwealth).\n\nExtension requests can include a request for a grading, but grading by itself cannot be used as a return criteria.\n\nValuations. All lots are described with either a catalogue value (always stating which catalogue was used) or a face value, or estimate \"Est.\" which is our best estimation as to what the lot should sell for on a normal day at auction. Estimates are also used on items that are either not catalogued, or for large lots, or postal history, or items for which a catalogue value is irrelevant, etc. For Canadian stamps, we use Unitrade values for single items or sets (as long as all the items in the set are centered the same). For collections, we use the Scott catalogue value (in US$) as it only lists one centering / quality level. Each sale overview will be accompanied by a list of the specific catalogues used in that sale. The term \"owner's catalogue value\" is just that, and not verified by us, and the same applies to \"identified by owner as\", etc.\n\nQuality for a lot is usually described as fine, very fine, extremely fine, and for single items, these terms will usually apply to the centering, and faults, if present, will be described in words. Used or ungummed stamps cannot be returned for having a hinge. In the case where there are several items in a lot, or stamp multiples, we can use the term \"overall\" to give an idea of the predominant condition. For postal history, it is normal to see small faults on most 19th century covers, or at least one filing crease on folded letters. Significant faults will usually be mentioned, especially if we feel it will affect the desirability of an item, and therefore early postal history is not returnable for normal small faults. Items sold for the postmark are not returnable for faults (usually described if significant) on the supporting item (cover, stamp, etc.)\n\nBidding Increments (bids provided to us prior to the auction not conforming to these increments will be rounded down to the next increment):\n\n$50 – $200\n\n$10.00\n\n$200 – $500\n\n$25.00\n\n$500 – $1,500\n\n$50.00\n\n$1,500 – $3,000\n\n$100.00\n\n$3,000 – $7,000\n\n$200.00\n\n$7,000 – $15,000\n\n$500.00\n\n$15,000 – $30,000\n\n$1,000.00\n\n$30,000 – $100,000\n\n$2,000.00", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "8dcf9e08-2cfa-4d6f-94ec-abf5cb9e415c", "url": "https://gcpauctions.com/terms/"}

{"text": "News Burst 22 January 2023 – Get The News!\n\nNews Burst 22 January 2023\n\nNews Burst 22 January 2023 – Featured News\n\nRoused by deafening bangs and shouts, the 60-year-old retired software developer stumbled out of bed to find a crowd of unfamiliar men in military gear standing in his foyer. One of the half dozen men, he remembers, was visibly armed and pointing a gun in his direction. Another was holding a riot shield. \"This is the FBI,\" one yelled. \"Put your hands against the wall!\" Less than a minute later, Joerg Arnu was being handcuffed and led forcefully outside. Arnu had one particular hobby that he felt might be of interest to federal investigators: he had spent the last two decades tending to a popular blog about \"Area 51,\" the remote military base near Rachel that was known for its shroud of mystery and UFO lore. Arnu's site, Dreamland Resort, regularly posted news about the base—including articles about its alleged connection to \"black projects\" and other clandestine government operations. Still, running a blog wasn't illegal, and the force with which the government had come down on him seemed unbelievable. Just what exactly were agents looking for what? And what did they think he'd done? \"I was treated like a drug dealer or some hardened criminal,\" Arnu said.\n\nLast month, Larry Page and Sergey Brin, Google's founders, held several meetings with company executives. The topic: a rival's new chatbot, a clever A.I. product that looked as if it could be the first notable threat in decades to Google's $149 billion search business. The re-engagement of Google's founders, at the invitation of the company's current chief executive, Sundar Pichai, emphasized the urgency felt among many Google executives about artificial intelligence and that chatbot, ChatGPT. The bot, which was released by the small San Francisco company OpenAI two months ago, amazed users by simply explaining complex concepts and generating ideas from scratch. More important to Google, it looked as if it could offer a new way to search for information on the internet.\n\nIn a new petition, the group Clean Skies Texas is collecting signatures to ask state representatives to pass laws banning dangerous atmospheric aerosol spraying without prior approval and testing of the chemicals being sprayed. The petition states: \"We, the undersigned, are concerned Texas citizens who demand our State Legislators pass legislation to protect our families, pets, crops, water and environment from any and all negative side effects of County, State, Federal, Military, as well as any corporation, NGO or non-profit organization spraying of our sky.\"\n\nOn January 21, an IAI Heron-1 drone, also known as Shoval, crashed while taking off from an unspecified airbase in Israel, according to the Israeli Defense Forces. An Israeli military source said that the advanced drone was damaged as a result of the crash. Nevertheless, it will be repaired. This was the third time in four months that the IAF had grounded the fleet of Shoval drones. In September, a drone crashed into the sea along Israel's maritime border with Lebanon and was retrieved by the Israeli Navy. Later in November, another crashed near the southern Israeli city of Arad. The cause of the new drone incident was not reportedly related to an engine problem that was behind the November crash.\n\nFor nearly a year, the massive Western propaganda machine has been manipulating its audience into believing the \"Russia's unprovoked aggression in Ukraine\" narrative. However, WikiLeaks, an organization the United States has been trying to shut down for well over a decade, including through the horrendous treatment of its founder Julian Assange, published secret cables showing this narrative couldn't possibly be further from reality. Data indicates that American officials weren't only aware of the frustration NATO expansion caused in Moscow, but were even directly told it would result in Russia's response. And while the US often insists that the current crisis is a result of Vladimir Putin's alleged desire to \"rebuild the Russian Empire\", WikiLeaks reveals that even his predecessor Boris Yeltsin, infamous for his suicidal subservience to Washington DC, warned against NATO expansion. For approximately three decades, consecutive US administrations were explicitly warned that Ukraine's NATO membership would be the last straw for Moscow. According Critics of the survey have called it a blatant attempt to \"indoctrinate\" young children who do not know \"if they want chicken nuggets or fish fingers for dinner.\"\n\nGermany's foreign intelligence service is alarmed by losses the Ukrainian army is suffering in fighting against Russian forces in the eastern Ukrainian city of Bakhmut, news magazine Der Spiegel reported on Friday. The Ukrainian army is losing a three-digit number of soldiers every day, the BND intelligence service told a group of Bundestag lawmakers who focus on security at a secret meeting this week, Spiegel said, citing information it had received. The BND warned that the capture of Bakhmut by Russian forces would have significant consequences, as it would allow Russia to make further advances.\n\nA team of scientists has endured the inhospitable conditions of the icy desert of Antarctica to recover five new meteorites, including a near-17-pound monster space rock. The team of scientists included Field Museum and the University of Chicago researcher Maria Valdes, who estimated that of the 45,000 meteorites recovered to date from the icy wasteland of Antarctica, only 100 or so have been as large as the largest member of this new haul, which weighs 16.7 pounds (7.6 kilograms). \"Size doesn't necessarily matter when it comes to meteorites, and even tiny micrometeorites can be incredibly scientifically valuable, but of course, finding a big meteorite like this one is rare and really exciting,\" Valdes said in a statement.\n\nThe planet Venus is the undisputed star of the night skies this year. Venus, now in our southwest sky for about two hours after sunset, is almost like a stellar sequined showgirl, currently starring nightly in her brilliant performance. Viewed during evening twilight, this planet appears dazzlingly bright to the naked eye and even more so in binoculars. To those who monitor it from week to week in telescopes, it is ever changing and ever fascinating.\n\nIt's not often we get excited about a new moon from a skywatching perspective, given that you can't see anything from the vantage point of Earth. (New moons occur when the illuminated half of the moon is facing away from us, leaving us seeing nothing but darkness.) But last night's new moon is a particularly special one. It's the closest new moon to Earth since the year 1030. At 3:54 p.m. EST (2054 GMT), the moon will be exactly 221,561 miles (356,568 km) away from our planet, according to Timeanddate.com(opens in new tab), which sifted through data from NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory to determine the distances of every Earth-moon distance for hundreds of years.\n\nNews Burst 22 January 2023\n\nNews Burst 22 January 2023 – Bonus IMG\n\nVirtaka Cliff\n\nThe Krimulda parish and municipality is located close to the shores of the Baltic Sea in Latvia.

{"text": "4 Nights Pondicherry Tour From Bangalore. If you are looking for somewhere exciting and far away, a 4 nights Pondicherry tour from Bangalore is the perfect choice.\n\nHere are some of the top things that make Pondicherry such an unforgettable destination:\n\nThe French Quarter\n\nThe French Quarter, with its brilliantly preserved French essence, is one of the main attractions of Pondicherry. As you walk slowly along the tranquil grid of boulevards and streets, you'll feel yourself time-traveling as far back as the colonial era.\n\nThe area is colorfully painted with elegant colonial villas in yellow, exhibiting unique mansions, manicured gardens, and galleries. Many buildings have been transformed into cute stores and coffee shops where you can have coffee and taste French sweets.\n\nSeaside Promenade\n\nSeparating the French Quarter from the dazzling Bay of Bengal is the lovely Beach Road Promenade, also referred to as Goubert Avenue.\n\nHere you can walk along the waterfront, observe people, bite into something nice from sellers, and witness the beautiful sunsets over the ocean. The colonnades have statues on both sides and are decorated with old heritage buildings in light pastel colors. It's ideal for an evening stroll to enjoy the sights and sounds of the city.\n\nAuroville\n\nJust 10km from the city northwest stands the experimental township of Auroville, which was founded by spiritual guru Mirra Alfassa in 1968. The core principle of this special community is the unity of its members and sustainable living practices.\n\nEnjoy a day for an exploration of the UNESCO World Heritage Site, visiting the important site of the golden-orb Matrimandir, the Visitor's Centre with displays on Auroville's philosophy, paper factories and multiple artisan villages presenting crafts, textiles, and pottery.\n\nBeaches\n\nThe fact that Pondicherry is a coastal location means that it is blessed with sandy beaches, which are the perfect place to just chill and relax the entire day. Paradise Beach and Serenity Beach are two beaches with fewer crowds and more isolated areas.\n\nLife comes alive at Promenade Beach in town, featuring restaurants, playgrounds and beach activities such as surfing and boating. Auro Beach in Auroville is another nice place with not many travelers. Beach hopping is a rather nice way to spend a day or two during your 4 nights Pondicherry tour from Bangalore.\n\nFood\n\nPondicherry's history of multiculturalism has resulted in a distinctive local cuisine that takes inspiration from the French, Tamil and Muslim culinary traditions.\n\nDon't forget to explore iconic dishes like fresh seafood curry, vegetarian curry with a kick, buttery French pastries, aromatic biryani, or even decadent French desserts. Whether cozy French Quarter cafes or seaside shacks as well as bustling markets, the city is full of different tastes that are ready to be discovered.\n\nFrom its fusion of east-meet-west culture, colonial heritage, and colorful culture to beaches, food and spiritual communities, Pondicherry offers an unforgettable escape. Don't miss out on the French War Memorial, Pondicherry Museum, Romain Rolland Library, and the amazingly tranquil Sri Aurobindo Ashram.

{"text": "Raj to get 4L metric tonnes of coal from Chhattisgarh\n\nJaipur: Rajasthan will receive 4 lakh metric tonnes (approximately 100 rakes) of coal that was stuck in the washeries of Chhattisgarh, an official statement from the chief minister's office (CMO) said on Thursday. This coal will increase the reserves in the state's power plants, ensuring adequate electricity for the public, the CMO said. The coal supply will provide temporary respite to the thermal plants in the state as 1 lakh metric tonnes are required daily to meet the power demand, the official statement said.\n\n\"At present, all 23 power plants in the state are operational, and we are receiving 25 rakes of supply. We currently have a 7-day stock in advance. With the receipt of an additional 4 lakh metric tonnes, an extra 4 days of stock will be added, as 1 lakh metric tonnes are required daily to feed the thermal plants,\" the CMO said. Rajasthan State Power Generation Corporation had awarded Aryan Coal Beneficiation India Limited (ACBEL) in Korba, Chhattisgarh, a five-year contract to supply coal from SECL's mine to the Suratgarh and Chhabra thermal power plants. However, in July 2022, ACBEL's washeries were sealed due to joint actions by Chhattisgarh's state tax (GST) department, mineral department, revenue department, and environment department, causing about 4 lakh metric tonnes of Rajasthan's coal to be stuck in the washeries. CM Sharma contacted Chhattisgarh chief minister Vishnu Deo Sai and also the Central govt, requesting release of the coal, the statement from CMO said. Following the CM's efforts, the Chhattisgarh govt took action to release the coal and the district collector of Korba recentlly ordered the release of 4 lakh metric tonnes.", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "f9d6670b-1c31-4683-bdba-273c1687eb4f", "url": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/rajasthan-to-receive-4-lakh-metric-tonnes-of-coal-from-chhattisgarh/articleshow/111152166.cms"}
