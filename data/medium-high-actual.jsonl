This is an idea I had at some point along my four day drive across the country. QR codes are very popular for some reason. Marketers insist that they're useful and demand to put them in everything despite the fact that nobody uses them.\n\nThe real problem with QR codes is that they force people to use a machine to translate what could easily be human-readable information. Rather than a QR code, why not just show the text \"Chevy.com\" or even better just the word \"Chevy\" because everyone knows how to google stuff? Seriously, I've seen QR codes on highway billboard signs as if anyone is going to whip out their smartphone while they're pulling 65.\n\nSo why a clock? As I've said before, clocks have already sort of been perfected. A digital wristwatch is probably the most convenient, accurate, and durable way to tell the time possible. Any attempt to change the typical blue-light special wristwatch will only make it more expensive or harder to read. This clock attempts to do both.\n\nAlso, this clock points out the ultimate irony of QR codes which is that they are a technological convenience that really isn't convenient. In order to read this clock, the user will require some sort of QR scanning device which is guaranteed to have a time-telling function built into it already.\n\nSo, that's why I made it. Hilarious, right?\n\nYou can find out more about how it was put together at ch00ftech's blog here\n\nlevelHead is a spatial memory game by Julian Oliver, developed at the end of 2007, beginning 2008.\n\nlevelHead uses a hand-held solid-plastic cube as its only interface.

By tilting the cube the player directs this character from room to room in an effort to find the exit.\n\nSome doors lead nowhere and will send the character back to the room they started in, a trick designed to challenge the player's spatial memory. Which doors belong to which rooms?\n\nThere are three cubes (levels) in total, each of which are connected by a single door. Players have the goal of moving the character from room to room, cube to cube in an attempt to find the final exit door of all three cubes.

{"text": "Similarly the Crampin Steam Fishing Company with its subsidiary Bunch and Perihelion Steam Fishing Companies were old established Grimsby trawler owners, formed by Herbert Crampin of Cleethorpes, with offices in Fish Dock Road who during the 1930s began modernising their elderly trawler fleet named their new vessels after well-known cricketers with seven letters in their names. They had five new steam trawlers, each of 450 gross tons, built by Cochrane & Sons of Selby from 1936-37.\n\nHammond (GY 284) was named after England cricketer Walter Reginald Hammond (1903-1965) who was rated by Wisden's as one of England's best batsmen.\n\nJardine (GY 301) was named after Douglas Jardine who, while captaining England during the 1932-33 Australian Ashes tour, employed the controversial \"bodyline\" bowling technique against the outraged opposition.\n\nLarwood (GY 255) was named after Harold Larwood (1904-1993) who implemented his \"fast leg theory\" bowling during the 1932-33 Aussie Test.\n\nFinally, Leyland was named after England cricketer Maurice Leyland (1900-1967), who scored 2,764 runs for England during his career.\n\nThree nearly-new trawlers were also purchased from Sir Alec Black in 1938 and renamed.\n\nBarnett (GY 200) was named after England cricketer Charles Barnett (1884-1962), who also played football for Cheltenham Town. Paynter (GY 480) was named after England's left-handed batsman Edward Paynter (1901-1979) and Wellard (GY 300) named after Arthur Wellard (1902-1980).\n\nHowever, at the outbreak of the Second World War, their cricketer fleet of modern trawlers were soon requisitioned by the Admiralty and converted to anti-submarine vessels.\n\nThis resulted in just three of them, Barnett, Paynter and Wellard, returning to Grimsby after the war ended.\n\nThey joined Pataudi (GY 104), built in 1934 and named after Mansoor Ali Khan Pataudi, captain of India's cricket team.\n\nThen, 1950 saw two new distant water steam trawlers delivered. Bradman (GY 161), the second Crampin trawler named after Australian cricketing legend Donald Bradman (1908-2001) who was arguably the \"greatest batsman of all time\" with a Test batting average of 99.94 runs.\n\nThe Yardley (GY 81) was named after Walter Dransfield Yardley (1915-1989). He was voted Wisden's Cricketer Of The Year in 1948 and was captain of Yorkshire from 1948-1955.\n\nThen, 1956 saw Crampin's take delivery of a new German-built steam trawler Statham (GY 25) which was named after England cricketer John Brian Statham (1930-2000).\n\nFinally, 1961 saw Crampin's take delivery of their last new trawlers, two diesel powered vessels built by Cook Welton & Gemmell of Beverley.\n\nIn 1965, Crampin's fleet of five trawlers was bought by Ross Trawlers who, according to their own policy of naming their trawlers after Royal Navy vessels with the prefix Ross, renamed Bradman Ross Anson and Yardley Ross Howe.\n\nBoth trawlers moved to Hull in 1968 and were scrapped shortly afterwards.\n\nStatham became Ross Repulse before being sold to Northern Trawlers in 1968 and renamed Northern Sky. She was finally scrapped in 1976.\n\nTrueman was renamed Ross Juno before being sold to South Africa in 1968 and Padgett was renamed Ross Jupiter being sold to Panama in 1982. As a young \"trawler spotter\" in the late 1950s it was easy to spot Crampin's vessels among the crowded North Wall with their distinctive blue, yellow and black funnels painted with a large letter C.\n\nToday the trawler naming tradition continues with Alward's Jubilee fleet of new trawlers.\n\nComments\n\n\"Thanks for another interesting article However the trawler \"Northern Sky\" could not have acquired that name as late as 1968 for she was managed with that name by H Markham Cook when i worked for them in 1945.

{"text": "Hey everyone. I had a question about the etiquette of asking folks on BPL if they would be willing to be beta testers for an incredibly revolutionary product that will change the face of UL backpacking forever. OK, I definitely made that last part up.\n\nBefore I go further I will say that I have submitted a question to the BPL admin folks about not messing up their dedication to non-commercial uses of BPL, and I am sure I will hear from them soon, but since it has been a couple of weeks I hope it is not rude to ask the question here. I also didn't find any FAQ type answers, but perhaps I missed something. The odds of this being a commercialized product set are definitely about one in ten bazillion, but I didn't want to cross any clear rules on this front.\n\nThe short story: I have some definitely unique, and perhaps even not absolutely horrible design ideas on MYOG gear stuff. Also, I really think it would be cool to have a patent. Even a provisional one. So here is the best case for me: 1) I apply for a couple of provisional patents (already mostly done, this initial part is cheap at least). 2) I recruit some BPL folks to try it out, by sending them working prototypes for free. 3) The idea turns out to be a horrible one,no one would be hurt or anything, just potentially annoyed at carrying a bad idea out onto the trail. 4) The patent office grants my cheap patent because it is just a horrible idea, hence no one has thought it worth pursuing before. 5) I proudly carry my unique and poor idea around on the trail,and maybe mention my patent pending or whatever a few times at cocktail parties.\n\nAnyway, my ideas are definitely unique, which probably means bad. I am OK with that. I really just like making my own stuff. But this seemed like an opportunity to just mess around a bit and justify purchases, etc.\n\nSo that is a long way of asking, would it be rude to ask/solicit potential beta testers for my world beating innovative products that will transform UL hiking forever (for free of course)? At this point I am hoping that my designs are just so impracticable that I can both have a cheapish patent pending, but also have at least one or two people think it was kind of cool. Plus my patents would be air-tight, as they could be pending forever w/o the real expense of a full patent....anyway I digress.\n\nSorry to go on so long. Mostly this whole patent thing has been an excuse to hike more and buy and sew and beta test all sorts of things and materials that I could never explain to my wife otherwise. Perhaps that is what I should have said first.\n\nAnyway, there are probably a thousand posts here where someone has invented sliced bread or the wagon wheel (I have read many). As above, my belief is that the best possible outcome is that my idea is just good for me. Thanks all for suggestions, and feel free to tell me to not bother and just have fun MYOGing. That's basically what my wife tells me so you would definitely be on the right side of that issue. But who doesn't like free stuff? And can I borrow one of your patents?...)\n\nWell, if I tell you I would have to kill you.\non 07/14/2012 21:36:18 MDT\n\nFranco:\n\nSeriously though it is a system for regular tarp users who are sometimes interested in having bug protection and bathtub floor, but not always. It has some clever bits, but also some very impractical ones (as my 13-year old pointed out this weekend). Probably 1 MM people have already had the same idea, although I can promise that my bad ideas on this front will be at least distinctive. Still hoping for a failure, but not a colossal one...actually a colossal one would be good, just not a catastrophic one. Maybe I should just send something to you and Henry and you can tell me that my ideas were awesome and I have a 'patent' on it, maybe 'patent #12345' or something. That would definitely be cheaper. And then I can just enjoy my TT Moment and the trail.\n\nTimeline might help too as people tend to hike more or less depending on the time of year. I personally don't spend much time on the trail this time of year. It's a good time for me to gain weight and lift a lot of weight, but not a great time to offer to test your gear.\n\nI wouldn't mind testing whatever it is you're making. I don't know if I'll have the opportunity to do so anytime soon, but I'm currently making a tarptent, so your invention may come in handy. Even if it won't, it's always interesting to see what other people come up with.\n\nTim, Seeking a patent is really not worth it in the ultra light backpacking equipment . I guarantee you someone has made it or thought of it already and patent is only good for 10 years and additional 10 years renewal and person or company only needs to change the design by 10% to avoid patent infringement.\n\nNow trademarking a names that were it at less expensive to research and cheaper to do and most large companies will respect that. Also they will change their design copy of your equipment by 20% to play it on the safe side in case it goes to court . Terry\n\nI would certainly be interested in testing out new gear. I love to analyze the pluses and cons of gear. I'm new to BackpackingLight but I recently found out about this site from over on HammockForums where I'm active.\n\nJust because the patent office doesn't actually really check very well when you apply for a patent doesn't mean that prior art doesn't exist. The best way to get free prior art checks done is to try to patent something that everyone in the area knows has existed for a long time, then they research it and provide the prior art example, and pooof, no patent. I'm actually glad that the myog people I like to give money to don't get into this game, it's refreshing.\n\nAll anyone has to do is dig up a forum thread where someone discussed or mentioned the idea you had prior to the patent being granted, then your patent is invalid.\n\nThis stuff comes up all the time in the software world (due to a horrible decision by the courts to allow software as a patentable item, along with business methods), but with something with such a limited and finite set of actual things you can make or design, the odds are really high that the stuff has already been made or invented by some diy or myog type years ago, only they never really cared about it in terms of trying to lock in the idea for profit.\n\nThe current patent system is really sloppy, so obvious and self-evident patents are granted all the time, sadly, so it could be worth a try, but it's unlikely to make you many friends long term.\n\nMore manufactured items that actually are unique because of some new technique or technology on the other hand stand a chance, things like stoves, climbing tools (like what Jardine invented, for example), etc that might have a new design or something.\n\nHarald said: \"The current patent system is really sloppy, so obvious and self-evident patents are granted all the time, sadly, so it could be worth a try, but it's unlikely to make you many friends long term\".\n\nYour correct on that and it's funny you mention Ray Jardine he is the perfect example of what can happen to a person . Ray only has one patent for a spring loaded camming device for rock climbing .\n\nRay still has a bad taste in his mouth on the Golite deal he did to bring ultra light weight backpacking equipment to the masses. When Ray quit working for Golite he has made enemies saying people are copying all his ideas that he did not patent. In his books he suggest you should take the name tag off all your products.\n\nI even had manufacture get mad at me through PM for a one off bandoleer type backpack that Chris Zimmer prototyped for him. I explained the pack I made was for my personal use only you can see a photo of the pack in my avatar photo. So it started a misunderstanding over MYOG project.\n\nAlmost every form of a backpacking gear has been made over the years so it hard to get patent for a product and very costly for vanity sake. So if a person copies and patent a MYOG project a person made because they were to lazy they will make enemies.\n\nAlso most of the MYOG people consider their project ideas as gifts to the group and the group is Gear think tank to learn from. The members that do go in to business for themselves we are very proud of them to be able to make a living on products and ideas that have been around for years.\n\nTo the OP, don't let these last two posters rain on your parade. I have a patent on an ultralight piece of gear that pays all my bills. I am not rich, but I sure do have an easy job. Take Packa out of box, print postage, drop in mailbox---takes about 10 minutes a day. I sell on average about 1 every two days.\n\nSounds like you are on the right track. Make some up and let some trusted friends check them out. If you get a good response--go for it. I agree with the vainity angle. You almost have to approach it that way, because you really don't know if it will make money. When I was at your stage I also told myself I didn't care if it made money, I just wanted to be able to say I had a patented invention.\n\nI would recommend not getting the provisional patent. Not worth it in my opinion. You can document (protect) your idea without getting a provisional. Either way, with or without a provisional, you are time limited to officially file for a patent--exactly one year.\n\nIf you haven't done so, do a patent search on line. You can do everything a lawyer can do at the USPTO website and googlepatents. Definitely do a search before you file a provisional.\n\nIf you want to discuss this in more detail, contact me through my Packa website. Good luck, Cedar Tree \n\nEddie, I was not aware of your Packa that's a pretty original design of combo Poncho/Pack cover/ Jacket it really cool idea worthing getting the product patented.\n\nI was reacting to the suggestion of Harald's posting that people could get patents on equipment that people in this MYOG forum designed and made for personal use,Shared the idea for anyone to use for free. Because the original designer did not want to get a patent, they were to lazy, did not have the money to get a patent. I think that kind of actions by people would be a bad thing for MYOG crowd we would quit sharing are ideas.\n\nI look forward to Tim the original posters and his new ideas he will get patent and may sell one day.\n\nLike I posted in one post it is very hard to find backpacking equipment that has not been made before sometime in history.\n\nI remember back in the Late 70's early 80's a company who came out with Ultra light weight backpacking gear . The packs were sky blue color made out of 1.9 oz.ripstop looked similar to Ray way type packs like we use now. They had ultra light weight sleeping bags, parkas and other gear. Their pitch line was\" Backpacking Gear light as a Cloud\" They had one problem most of people were using their old heavy gear still and the packs were ripping apart. I really wish I could remember the name of the company.\n\nI was even designing and making ultra light weight day packs back in 1993 made out of 1.9oz. ripstop nylon similar to Ray Jardines for day hikes,I did not have a computer back then i had no knowledge of what was going on in backpacking. I just like making my own equipment and it all started with the Frostline equipment sleeping bag kit I made when I was 11 years old in boy scouts.\n\nOregon photos has the most comprehensive history of backpacking gear and the companies. You look through it ultra light is not a new idea. Backpackers have always tried to lighten up their gear.  Terry\n\nAll you have to do is document your idea in some \"officially dated\" way. For the Packa, all I did was the old timey write a description of my invention, had 2 witnesses sign and date it, and sent it off in a letter to myself. The post mark becomes your official date. Don't open the letter. Probably a better approach would be to simply have it notorized. Even posting a description and pictures here on BPL would do the trick. You might think someone could steal your idea, but actually just the opposite is true-- you just documented it was your idea. I wouldn't do it that way. But, that is the way it works as I understand it. Regardless of how you do it, you have exactly 1 year to file from the day you \"officially date\" your idea. If you don't file for a patent within one year, no one can--not even you. Your idea becomes public domain.\n\nTo Terry:\n\nI'm not trying to bust your balls, but in your first post on this thread you stated \"Seeking a patent is really not worth it in the ultra light backpacking equipment\". I didn't get the borrowing of a MYOG idea and trying to patent it from the OP. He said in his OP that he had a \"unique\" idea. I was just trying to encourage the OP to follow his dream. Also you said someone could change your idea by 10% and get around your patent. I disagree. If you have a patent lawyer worth his salt, this won't happen. The patent claims are the key, by far the most important part of a patent. For example, if you look at my claims for the Packa patent you will see language like \"the the packcover is 30 inches tall, MORE OR LESS\". These words are probably not actually in my patent claims--just trying to make a point. You just can't change a little thing like a dimension and get around a patent. If you have a good lawyer, you shouldn't have to worry about this. That's the whole point of having a patent. If it was so easy to design around it, no one would ever get a patent.\n\nI didn't get that sense either, from the OP or Terry, rather, it's just that most ideas have been done when it comes to this stuff, so the odds are, someone has done it. That would go for your idea too, it's just such a small market with so little at stake that it's literally not worth spending the time a prior art search would require. I suspect 'borrowing' is more that there is just this pool of stuff people have done, and at some point, something almost everyone comes up with borrows from that pool of collective knowledge, like, oh, making something out of cuben or silnylon, for example.\n\nIn a sense this would be agreeing with you, given the relatively dismal state of the patent office and what they grant, if you can get a patent on something before someone else does, and if the market is small enough so that nobody else really exerts much energy to demonstrate it invalid, you're right, it really is your patent, and it would be a relative headache with relatively few rewards to try to get rid of it. So that does work. One of the more famous cases of patenting something so obvious nobody ever thought it worthwhile is amazon's 'one click purchase' patent, which I believe is still holding up. That is similar literally to patenting the use of silnylon in outdoor gear.\n\nPersonally I doubt your own business success has much to do with the patent, I suspect it's just a nice idea that's nicely done, like most cottage gear is, and the market is so small, as your numbers show, that it's not really worth trying to compete there, and certainly not worth trying to get into some patent thing that will never repay the legal and research costs. And there does seem to be a certain ethical standard among most myog cottage types, ie, in general they try to do their own things largely, give or take. And if you get sick of doing it, you might be able to sell the patent to some other company for some amount at some point, at which point you'd probably discover the actual value of the patent. Probably not a good idea to depend on that for retirement I'd guess...\n\nJardine's case was interesting, I have a climber friend, used to be world class in his younger days, that certainly grants the high value of the Climber's Friend device, that was unique and did change climbing, but he laughs at the notion of unique backpacking gear that is patentable, observing, largely correctly, that it really has been done before in almost all cases, but that shouldn't stop someone from trying to patent some idea I suppose, though personally I dislike such patent activity, but it is something one can do in the modern day USA if one is so inclined, ie, it's a loophole that can be exploited.\n\nJardine's later complaints though, those are just silly, his entire point was to make simple light gear that was easy to sew and easy to deal with, and to free you from corporate type outdoor equipment clutter and waste, and thus be, almost by definition, generic, I read his book a while ago, can't remember which one, an earlier one, and it was all about simple and obvious ideas that anyone could do. A tarp, a quilt, a bag style backpack? Give me a break. He just got older and needed to find a way to fund his lifestyle, that's all, and he'd sold his actually unique ideas long ago, and burned the golite bridge, which I'm sure happened for good reasons.\n\nI'm a patent attorney. Some comments to to correct misinformation follow:\n\npatents are good for 20 years from the date they are filed. You have to pay a maintenance fee at 3.5, 7.5, and 11.5 years.\n\nwith a provisional application, it never turns into an issued patent, all you get is a filing receipt. There is no content requirement, but its a good idea to have a really complete disclosure with claims and informal drawings\n\nits not easy to get a patent, its darn hard. I'd wish I knew some of those easy patent examiners.\n\npatents are totally not worth it, unless the product is a good one and has the potential to make some money. If the product develops into a real business, you'll wish you had a patent. If you think your product has no chance of being commercially successful, might as well not get a patent. There are 4 reasons to get a patent:\n\n1. as a wall hanger, souvenir, learning experience 2. as an asset to your company, to add value to the company when it is sold 3. to keep a competitor from knocking off a profitable product, in case your product develops into a profitable item. Unfortunately, you have to file the patent application before the product becomes profitable 4. to keep from getting sued by a competitor for infringing their patent\n\nmailing a letter to yourself is evidence in proving date of first use or conception. Its not a patent and doesn't offer any protection to your product. Proving date of conception is of value to show that you were using it before a competitor's patent was filed. But like any evidence, its value depends on how easily it can be faked. So something can be evidence, but not very good evidence. There is way better evidence than that.\n\nTo get a patent a device has to be new (never been done anywhere), and not obvious. being \"non-stupid\" is not required.\n\nIf you get a patent and the product gets knocked off, your leverage is that you can license it to a bigger company, and the company knocking it off would probably like to get an exclusive license to the patent, so they can keep others out of that market. If you don't have a patent, you have nothing to license to a bigger company who can develop sales faster than you can.\n\nBob, Thank you very much for sharing your professorial knowledge as a patent attorney of the process of getting a patent and worth or worthlessness of the patent.\n\nI have one question I would like to find out if it is a Myth or Fact. Question: The changing the product 10 to 20 % rule would not be a patent infringement.\n\nThe only reason I ask is I remember my time in the skateboard , major appliance industry and I was seeing patents and trademarks being broken all the time. We as general public see this happening all the time as consumers now days seeing similar products coming out between competitors that release a innovative product with in 3 months or less . The Best example is the Apple iPhone.\n\nThere is no percentage rule, but the way it works out it can have that appearance.\n\nWhat you get in a patent is the claims, and the claims are basically a parts list. Claim 1 might be:\n\n1. a pocketknife comprising:\n\na main blade a corkscrew a scissors, and a saw.\n\nIf a competitor made a knife with 3 of those blades,he would not be infringing. Of course, you could not get this claim allowed if a knife with those blades already existed, or if this knife was obvious.\n\nSo if you have a claim with part A-Z, if someone can leave off one element, he is not infringing and is free to go. Thus, the challenge is to get a claim allowed with as few parts, or elements, as possible. Here is a good, broad claim.\n\n1. A vehicle including flight control means and propulsion means, comprising:\n\na fuselage and wings; and\n\na plurality of surfaces defining the exterior of said fuselage and wings, said surfaces consisting of a series of facets.\n\nAnother idea is that you want to guess the approximate life expectancy of the new invention. You can make better decisions about patenting or not patenting and how to deal with competition.\n\nI worked for a technology company in a certain narrow field. We saw a better way to design a mousetrap (to use the slang), so we got the patent process started. Later, a different and larger company introduced products that used the same design basis. We received the patent, and we simply watched the competition. Once their market profitability got good enough, we filed a patent infringement lawsuit. That went back and forth for a while, and then the other company simply gave up and offered our company a substantial sum of money to officially ignore them, which we did. However, in our product training classes and sales presentations, it gave us a huge unofficial claim to tell to more and more customers.\n\nOur company knew that it was not big enough to go head-to-head with the larger company, so we simply made our profit out of substantial settlements.\n\nThe moral of the story is that there is always more than one way to skin a cat.\n\nI recall talking to one executive some years back and found their use of the patent system pretty disgusting. They were early in their field, so they had a ton of patents, not to mention being big enough to have too many lawyers as well.\n\nI was surprised anyone would admit to this conduct, but here is what he told me: when any new company came into their field they just watched for awhile -- until the new company had enough money to be a worthwhile target. Then they hit the new company with a patent infringement lawsuit, whether or not any infringement was taking place. It was cheaper for the new company to settle than to fight even erroneous claims, so they basically got to tax any new entrant into their field.\n\nI would not object if the new company had to pay for legitimate patents. It's the paying even if they were not infringing anything that bothers me -- that is abuse of the legal system, and it is wrong. I am realistic enough to know that sort of thing happens, but that does not mean I have to like it or approve of it.\n\nSome yrs back I was working on a project with a new product (to my company). It was a \"me too\" product that had been in existence for a while, but we developed a more economical process than the existing producer had, and were out to get a substantial part of their business. Our process was more economical because we were basic in some of the raw materials, whereas the other producer had to purchase them from others. The other producer had 2 plants producing this product, one here in the US and one overseas. This was a business for them generating about $50,000,000 revenue, and about half of that was profit margin.\n\nSo we patented our process. Of course we were sued by the current producer for patent infringement, and they badmouthed us to the customers to try to scare them away from buying from us.\n\nTurns out there was 1 possible infringement technicality we were guilty of. The other producer had claim that a certain common contaminant was necessary for a decent quality product, so they claimed needing at least some low level (at least 1 ppm) of that to make acceptable product. This was in fact BS, but it allowed them a wide claim against similar processes because it was difficult to disprove, and difficult to eliminate. We in fact had several ppm frequently.\n\nOne day the competitors attorneys came to our plant, and I had to show them around and answer their questions. One thing I showed them was an expensive online analyzer showing that we had virtually NO amt of this impurity in our process. Yep, 0.001 ppm. Further, we had historical trends to show it stayed low. So they went away with the foundation of their suit broken.\n\nWhat they never asked, was if that analyzer was WORKING. It in fact was not. I was under no responsibility to divulge this if not asked. It only worked for a short period before the analyzer probe corroded and failed.\n\nThey ended up selling their business and both plants to us for something like $150 million, because they could not compete. We immediately shut down their US facility, and raised our prices. We kept the overseas because it provided poorer quality product to far east markets.", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "60e24a06-2398-476d-814e-91f9bdc26030", "url": "http://www.backpackinglight.com/cgi-bin/backpackinglight/forums/thread_display.html?forum_thread_id=66180&disable_pagination=1"}

He was also found guilty of stealing £1 million spent on antiques and £3.25 million which went to 19 different destinations.\n\nBut he was cleared of a fourth count of stealing £2.5 million and using it to pay his income tax bill.\n\nThe three women and seven men will on Tuesday continue deliberating on nine further counts after being given a majority direction.\n\nNadir, of Mayfair, central London, looked shocked as he stood in the dock for the verdicts.

{"text": "SKIING; Reading for the Best Line on Slopes\n\nBy JANET NELSON Published: December 12, 1991\n\nBy almost any measure, skiing cannot be called a user-friendly sport. Going up and down a mountain is simple compared with the logistics of getting there, tending equipment, taking lessons, eating, sleeping and snatching a bit of nightlife.\n\nThat's probably the reason so many books are written about skiing and so many skiers read them. They are keys to basic survival, or at least a reduction of hassles, and they represent a minimalist route to pleasure.\n\nRecent book offerings bear this out with hardly any of the coffee-table variety, but plenty of how-to, what-it's-like and getting-the-best-deal books published in soft cover. As gifts, these books are appropriate for skiers from beginners to experts.\n\nTwo books, published annually, which promise to keep traveling skiers up to date are \"Skiing America\" and \"Ski Europe\" (World Leisure, $14.95 each) by Charles Leocha and a group of contributing writers. Both books are loaded with facts, prices and names to help skiers cope at practically all the major ski resorts in North America and the Alps. They also provide advice on choosing a ski package, getting around Europe and finding friends to ski with. Resorts Around the World\n\nIn \"The Traveling Skier\" (Doubleday, $13), Andrew Slough covers a selection of ski resorts around the world, telling of his adventures with style and refreshing frankness. Also, numerous boxes with practical information about lodging, transportation and other facets of travel are scattered through the text.\n\n\"The Insider's Guide to the Best Skiing in New England\" (Western Eye Press, $11.95) by Peter Oliver has a more limited scope, but provides an insider's view -- warts and all. Besides essential facts, the Starter's Kit segments about each of the 22 areas offers advice and caveats for newcomers. Lots of opinion and even wit make this worth reading for Eastern skiers.\n\nAll of Vermont's areas are covered alphabetically and more or less equally in \"Ski Vermont!\" (Chelsea Green Publishing Co., $16.95) by Jules Older. The straightforward presentation includes history as well as facts and figures, plus some advice. The author knows his subject. Focusing on the Lodging\n\nMarge Lamy has made the selections carefully in \"Cross Country Ski Inns\" (Snow Vacations, $16.95), so the author has few complaints about the inns in the Northeast and Quebec that she describes. Despite the lack of criticism, there are differences in charm and amenities at the inns as well as in the extent of the cross-country trails and facilities. After reading Lamy, readers will know what to expect. Color pictures enhance the descriptions.\n\n\"The Cross Country Primer\" (Lyons & Burford, $14.95) by Laurie Gullion is described as a beginner's guide, but for anyone who aspires to mastery of cross-country skiing, this book offers clear and concise explanations of the sport. Beyond the most basic maneuvers, the author gives no-nonsense descriptions and exercises for advanced skills like skating and downhill skiing while wearing cross-country equipment. It's a useful self-teaching guide.\n\nAnother book that is appropriate for beginners, or at least those less familiar with skiing, is \"The Snow Skier's Bible\" (Doubleday, $12) by Peter Shelton. Practically every aspect of downhill and cross-country skiing -- instruction, equipment, weather, snow grooming, safety, mental attitudes, competition and exercises -- is touched upon, with some topics described in more detail. Photographs relieve the rather dry text.\n\nHal O'Leary, who has been a leader in teaching disabled people to ski, has written \"Bold Tracks\" (Cordillera Press, $16.95) to explain teaching techniques as much as to show handicapped people that skiing is within their reach. Approaches to skiing are described and illustrated for amputees, the visually impaired, paraplegics and people with practically every other handicap, with information about equipment and resources available.\n\nTwo books that take off-beat looks at the sport are \"The Art of Skiing, 1856-1936\" (Wood River Publishing, $19.95), by Gary H. Schwartz, and \"Vermont People\" (Vermont People Project, $35) by Peter Miller.\n\n\"The Art of Skiing\" is a visual history of magazine illustrations and covers, advertising artwork and postcards over this 80-year-period, before skiing became a popular sport.\n\n\"Vermont People\" is not about skiing, but about people displaced by skiing. Miller has composed a series of two-page essays, each with a handsome black and white photograph. They are stark portraits, revealing changes that have taken place in people's lives as recreation has grown to dominate Vermont's economy.", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "c843f751-7412-4667-97f0-787ae143f086", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/1991/12/12/sports/skiing-reading-for-the-best-line-on-slopes.html?src=pm"}
{"text": "Pages\n\nHere are some \"rules\" for you dog lovers out there (that is, if you're given to following just anyone's advice, whether or not they're qualified to give it):\n\n• Don't pet your dog unless he works for it first.\n• Don't let your dog move his head so that it is higher than your own.\n• Don't feed your dog until after you've eaten.\n• Don't step around your dog if she's in your path; make her get up and move, even if she's sound asleep.\n• Don't let your dog sleep with you or cuddle with you on the couch.\n• Don't clean up after your dog while she's watching you.\n\nBut, never fear. Here's what you can do:\n• Spit in your dog's food.\n• Wipe your baby's dirty diapers on the wall.\n\nWhy, you might ask? Because each action is said to either cause your dog to think he's dominant over you, or — in the case of the spitting and the wiping — tells your dog that you (and your baby) are dominant over her. Seriously. There are people out there telling us that these tips are critical to our own happiness as well as that of our dogs.\n\nOh my. Are we really still having this conversation? Are we really still talking about whether or not we need to \"get dominance\" over our dogs? Ten years ago, I wrote a column for Bark titled \"Alpha Schmalpha,\" in which I explained that dominance is one of the most misused and misunderstood words in the English language, at least in relation to dog training. As I and many other trainers and behaviorists repeat endlessly in books, blogs and seminars, dominance is simply a description of a relationship between two individuals who want the same thing.\n\nOne animal is said to be \"dominant\" over the other if he or she always has primary access to the pork chop that falls on the floor, or the favorite toy, or the cozy lap of a dozing guardian. Thus, it's about the resolution of situations in which there might be competition for a resource. It is not about coming when called, or sitting when told to sit, or accepting unfamiliar dogs into the yard.\n\nWe're not even sure how the concept relates to interactions between dogs, much less to interactions between two entirely different species like people and dogs. At present, thoughtful ethologists and behaviorists are re-evaluating the concepts of \"dominance\" and \"social status\" as they relate to the domestic dog. Although there are questions and quibbles about some of the finer points, experts almost universally agree that the concept of \"getting dominance\" over our dogs is, at best, not useful, and more often is harmful to our relationships with our best friends.\n\nYet, the idea that we must \"dominate\" our dogs lives on, zombie-like, in spite of years of research and experience that demonstrates \"being dominant\" over our dogs does not improve obedience. In fact, we know that using positive reinforcement results in the best behavior, the fewest behavioral problems and the richest relationships. Given that, the question we need to ask ourselves is this: why is the concept of achieving dominance over our dogs so seductive? Why is it so hard for people to give up?\n\nThis is most likely not a question with one answer. Given that humans are complex animals, I suspect there are many answers. And, of course, all we can do is speculate. Perhaps thinking about what might motivate us to hang onto this age-old concept can help us finally give it a respectful burial.\n\nSurely one reason that so many people are enamored of the concept is that social status is highly relevant to our species. No matter how egalitarian we are, the fact is that in restaurants, some people get better tables than others, and most of us can't walk into the governor's office just to have a chat. We address physicians as \"Dr. Johnson\" but we call nurses \"Anita\" or \"James\"; we ask the judge for \"permission to approach the bench\"; and if we are lucky enough to be given an audience at Buckingham Palace, we still, still, bow or curtsy to the queen.\n\nPages:\n\nPages\n\nHi Dr, McConnell (or Patricia, whichever you'd prefer),\nPlaying devil's advocate here: as resource managers, aren't we inherently \"dominant\" and always practicing dominance? The dog can't let themselves outside, feed or hydrate themselves…etc as domesticated animals they need humans (more or less) and with that structure in place we are \"theoretically\" the dominant species. Priority access to a preferred resource, well if the human is the one making the decisions and the ones doling out the resources, we inherently have priority access to it and are the ones in charge and decision makers (dominant ones). So why is it so hard to envision why humans use dominance and integrated that concept into daily use and use dominance in explanations to clients and in everyday interactions with their dogs?\nI love you columns and books,\nThank you RJ\n\nRJ: That's an excellent question and it deserves a thoughtful answer.It is indeed true that humans have priority access to some things in some contexts, but the point here is that most training (coming when called, sitting when asked, etc.) has nothing to do with competition for limited resources. That's exactly why it should not be used in most \"daily interactions\" because it isn't relevant to what most owners want or expect their dogs to do.\n\nDear Patricia , I totally agree with your comment regarding daily interactions of sitting when asked etc being irrelevant. I have not 'taught' my dog to sit....she already knows how to do it and I do not see the point in getting her to comply with commands all the time. When out on a walk if I want my dog to come to me I will call her and invite her to make the choice of coming to me, when she comes she is rewarded with a small treat or a hug. Dominance to me seems to be all about being a bully and not about respect. I would never get my dog to move out of the way, especially if she was sleeping, that is not about respect that is about being arrogant, almost like 'get out of my way'! I do not want to bully my dog like that I want a relationship where we have a mutual respect for each other.\n\nDr. McConnell,\nThank you for writing this. I am not a dog expert like you are, but I operate my own small dog walking service. Every day I do off-leash group walks with 7-12 dogs. Needing the feeling of control is more about us than the dogs. Anyone who works with dogs will make mistakes and the simplified theories about dominance are just that, and misleading. I am blessed to live in the SF Bay Area with lots of knowledgeable people and trainers who have spent time with me and shown me a lot.\n\nThere are so many subtleties that can easily be ignored by focusing on dominating a dog instead of building a rewarding relationship based on patience, consistency, positive reinforcement, and just spending time with a dog getting to know them as one would a person. With a lot of quality time together and a but of willingness to allow the dog to lead you a little bit, you can teach your dog a lot! Just communicating simply with eye contact is very effective and rewarding.\n\nI have a lot of responsibility keeping my dogs safe, and I love that we spend a lot of quiet alone time together without my needing to constantly annoy the dogs by barking commands and demanding obedience. I do expect it though, and when we're in an area with distractions, they feel safer just doing what I always expect when we're alone. I love them for that.\n\nOf course, there are days, but I have to say, a dog will teach one far more poignant lessons than one will teach a dog. For those commands that keep a dog polite and safe, practice makes perfect. Spend quality unhurried time with dogs, carry great treats...enjoy. I look forward to finding your book and devouring it! Thank you!\n\nGreat article as usual, Patricia. I think too that the reason people accept the \"dominance\" theory is that humans have HUGE egos and we like to be in charge of things. Oft-times we are not even able to be in charge of ourselves or our lives, so if we can lord it over a dog then hey why not? I also feel that the connotation of the word has been lost and when people hear the word dominance they also hear or think, \"punishment\".\nI think today's PR trainers would do well to find new words and phrases to describe what you so aptly describe: \" resolution of situations in which there might be competition for a resource. \"\nI will certainly do my best to do so with my clients in the future, describing resolutions to situations and behaviors.\nThanks again for the brilliant dialogue and opportunity to discuss rationally!\nBarb\n\nIt boils my blood when I realize there are people out there making lots of money writing writing article like this. My bet is that somehow Dr McConnell (and Cesar Milan) got ahold of the class notes I hand out to my obedience class students and tweaked the wording slightly. And to think I make peanuts compared their riches.\n\nOur prior Dalamatian was taught who was boss, as part of her obedience training for Search and Rescue. (Don't laugh, as a team with my wife, she surprised an awful lot of people.) After she retired from SAR, we eased up some the things listed in this article, and it was funny how her hearing became more and more selective. The come command would have to be followed up with an emphatic NOW. But she could still hear the cheese being unwrapped from the far end of the house.\n\nI agree with George on this one, whole heartedly.\nThis is a very subjective article for someone that is supposedly so qualified in her field of research.\nHow many dogs have you owned, raised, or trained? How many dogs do you interact with on a daily, weekly or monthly basis? All this hype sounds like something off one of those sad delusional television shows and books that people believe in. Every behavior problem I have ever witnessed in dogs owned by normal everyday people boils down to treating them like a spoiled little human child, not a domesticated wolf that has been shaped and molded by man to do what was needed of it. Hierarchy is the basis for all social animals to get along peacefully or kill each other out of competition. Wolves and humans both live by it. Dogs need it to be happy, and they are usually quite happy for us to take the lead, less stress on them. Dogs are only different from wolves because we bred them to be more dependent, to want to learn from us and communicate from us. These are similar behaviors to all once wild now domesticated animals. A wild or even zoo-bred wolf sees no point in listening to a human.\nPeople label dogs even based on how they respond to us and our demands of them. 'Stupid' dogs are labeled as such because they were bred to be more, independent and less biddable, and this then becomes why they are less 'intelligent', i.e. Spitz, Hounds, and many livestock guardian breeds. 'Smart' dogs are the ones that are easy to please, easy to train, and so 'intelligent' because they are highly biddable and highly dependent on human instruction or they fall apart (or destroy your house), i.e. retrievers, herding, working, and terriers.\nThe social interactions of wolves and dogs has been thoroughly studied, it's easy enough to find the studies on this. Anyone with any knowledge of canine behavior can see dominance and submission in a pack of 6 week old puppies where there will be more confident and leader born pups, middle grounders, and pups who are the most passive and giving of the bunch. Good breeders match the puppies' personality to their new families, usually with great success where there is few future problems. Most people don't get dogs from good breeders or good rescues so that bit of help is gone. Most owners will never spend hardly an hour a year trying to train their dog or puppy, and then they can't understand why they have so many problems. Most people understand nothing about canine body language, canine pack structure, or any other key facts to owning a domestic wolf in their house.\nSo it isn't a fair argument to say that dominance or submission doesn't exist and isn't relevant, because it does, between dogs, their owners, and each other. To say otherwise is to insult your very degree and field of knowledge, and gives no credit to you as a so called professional in these matters. Maybe you should be doing more research into canine etiology, since you have a 'degree' people will assume to believe you. But really, stop trying to be another Cesar by giving people bad and even dangerous advice.\n\nIt is true that as a species, dogs - even as puppies - show particular behaviors on the spectrum of submissive to bold and confident within a short period of time during their interactions. There are behaviors that are termed \"dominance gestures\" such as T-ing over another dog's shoulders with its head or paws, \"muscling up\" (becoming stiff and tall with the body leaning forward) and mounting...and all of these behaviors can be seen during PLAY and during agonistic (socially conflicted) interactions or threats up to and including aggression. You can see dogs pass through all these behaviors in a matter of seconds. So, when you learn canine signaling, you realize you are observing behaviors with more than the two motivations of dominance and submission.\n\nThis is the old-school, ham-handed stuff that makes me crazy. But if you love thinking you're all that, just rock on.\n\nWithin groups of dogs in a multiple dog household, there are certainly hierarchies, but they are not linear and static. They are fluid. For example, one dog is queen of all the tennis balls. Either no one bothers that dog when she has one or certain dogs - but not other dogs - can approach or take away the tennis ball from her. And the Queen of Tennis Balls may not give a rip if another dog takes away her rawhide, but NO ONE can bother her if she's on \"her\" chair. See what I mean? Each dog has resources it prefers and will show other dogs how valuable those resources are to it in any number of ways. But it isn't as though we're constantly fending off nuclear war in our own homes daily and neither are packs of wolves.\n\nIt is discouraging when encountering DOG TRAINERS who still believe that dogs don't know we're not dogs, too, and that rather than wolves living in cooperation to pass on their genes and survive as a species, they are constantly fighting each other to the death.\n\nWell that video doesn't prove to help your argument number two. As does the bashing for television watching. It's hard to see a valid argument here when you can't even properly read what the other voice had said. Number one never mentioned strict structure or anything you bashed back about. But hey, next time I see a more 'un-dominant' dog attack and maim an obviously 'non-dog' owner for taking it's chew or toy away or telling it it can't sleep on the human bed, I'll remember posts like this. But seems like there will be two sides to this spectrum and all the graying will be forgotten. Being closed minded never helps a logical argument. Sad stuff really.\n\nEven a dog that's at the bottom of the hierarchy, such as it is, will exhibit resource-guarding behaviour if pushed far enough. You certainly can coerce a dog into submission, but there is no guarantee it won't snap at some point.\n\nNo dog will be seen constantly reasserting its status in the pack. At any rate, resorting for a minute to the somewhat outdated terminology, \"alpha\" dogs would be less likely to do so than dogs ranking lower who seek to improve their standing and push the boundaries. As a result, constantly reminding your dog \"who's boss\" is likely not what an \"alpha\" dog would do, making it a tool of questionable efficiency in your hands.\n\nFurthermore, while a great deal has been passed down from wolves to dogs, dogs are not wolves. Neither are they humans, nor do they view themselves as such (with the possible exception of those who have not been sufficiently exposed to other dogs - but in that case they would know very little of canine society and the way it works, so attempting to enforce the rules of canine society would be of very little use). We cannot pretend to fully understand the nuances of canine communication, and much as we would like we cannot replicate canine behaviour because we are not the same species. We do not rely on scent in our communication - who knows what messages our pheromones relay to our dogs, and will we ever be able to control these messages? -, we do not have tails to wag or ears to flatten or prick up, and so forth. I do believe to some extent it is possible to cross these boundaries and communicate by posture and signals like yawning, growling, snarling - and the dogs will often pick up on them -, but still we cannot behave like dogs.\n\nInstead of attempting to force on them our concept of what life in a pack should be (especially since the science on that is constantly getting updated), we might as well accept we are members of two different species living together. Our goal should be to teach our dogs what is acceptable and what is not, in a clear way and without antagonising the dog. This can be achieved by reinforcing desired behaviour and letting undesired behaviour \"fade away\", or redirecting it, or - in a few cases - showing the dog that it is not desirable. If you are the source of all that's fun and grand, your dog will want to please you even if you don't make a great show of being the \"dominant one\" in the household.\n\nYes, the dominance theory worked - and works - better than letting the dog get away with everything, and in certain cases you might want to resort to techniques that sound somewhat similar to it in order to solve specific behavioural issues, but that doesn't mean there is no other - dare I say, better - way of training your dog.\n\nIncidentally, this only shows that she didn't find coming to you as soon as called very rewarding - entirely understandable, since recalls often interrupt activities that dogs find great fun, or at any rate highly interesting/exciting.\n\nYour being \"top dog\" and enforcing this would not have necessarily made it more rewarding for her to come to you, either. Of course, I do not know your dog and have not seen her working, but it sounds like SAR work was something she was good at and enjoyed doing, so performing actions linked to it was enjoyable as well; once SAR no longer was part of her life, she might have wanted something new to focus on and enjoy, linked with her obedience work (and recall).\n\nI love the dialog that comes with charged issues like \"dominance\" - it keeps us asking questions about all of our longest held perceptions. Personally I enjoy reading all sorts of authors, even the dominance theory proponents. I read the much maligned to form my own ideas instead of just listening to the opinions of others and I have learned a lot from unexpected places. But yes, there are so many great new ideas available to us now. It is a great time to be a dog lover. From Positive Reinforcement to Natural Dog Training - who knows who will have the next great thing to say? But ultimately it will be the dogs who teach us the most - which makes us very lucky indeed if we are quiet enough to listen and learn from our four-legged teachers.\n\nI don't disbelieve that dogs require some kind of Alpha or dominant figure in their lives, but I think we make this a bigger deal than it is.\n\nJust like Patricia, I have opposable thumbs (yay me!) and a large brain. I provide the food, the cuddly dog bed that I got on sale at Costco, the water, the shelter and the love.\n\nWithout me, my Maverick would be out in the cold, hungry, thirsty and not nearly as comfortable when he goes to sleep at night. Am I not the dominant figure just by being a human?\n\nI understand that a dog needs structure and boundaries in order to respect it's owner. That doesn't mean I need to walk around with my chest puffed out, constantly letting him know who's boss.\n\nPeople, these are domesticated dogs, here. Yeah, they carry on traits they've inherited from their wolf ancestors, but we've spent years and years conditioning them to be our best friend and companion. If we have to spend all of our time reminding them who's dominant, what was the point of domesticating them?\n\nI see Maverick as my best friend and companion. He respects me, I respect him. He knows better than to get into the trash, I know better than to be hurtful and mean to him, because it destroys his little puppy heart. He knows when I'm upset, I don't have to do cartwheels around the room. A simple \"NO\" suffices.\n\nThis all boils down to the fact that today everyone wants a quick fix. No one wants to put the work in to make their dog a satisfactory companion.\n\nToday, most people won't do what my grandfather did and spend hours and hours outside teaching a dog obedience. If he was going to bring a new dog home, he was going to invest himself in it for as long as he needed to, and in turn the dog always invested itself in him. It's a lesson he taught his children, and in turn my mother taught it to me. We never had a family dog that wasn't exemplary.\n\nWhy or why does this keep being such a divisive issue? I do not get why people cling to this concept of dominance with such passion. Who else knows better than a person who wrote her PhD thesis on dog behaviour?\n\nHow can people continue to argue in spite of the most authoritative sources.\n\nIt baffles me.\n\nWe just all need to keep writing articles about this and hopefully, one day, the last retrograde, dominance-obsessed, trainer, will retire and make room for fact-based and humane training.\n\nBecause unsuspecting, uninformed new dog owners like me keep stumbling upon the aforementioned dominance trainers. Y'all, please don't give up. It's taken me a few years but I finally see the light on my dominance supporting dog trainer and why his advice did not sit well with me. On to the positive!\n\nPatricia,\nYou \"Keep going girl!\" Sometimes it seems like we are hitting our heads against a wall when people argue the whole dominance thing...My friend Marge keeps reminding me of a saying (I think it came from Steve White, but am not sure so I can't really give proper credit), but it keeps me sane when working with people who want to argue the dominace issue or the whole issue of whether science based training really works - here it is:\n\"Some will,\nSome won't\nSo what\nSomeone's waiting.\"\n\nWhen we make the effort to understand our canine companions and become better 'leaders', we also get a chance to evolve as a human being!\nLearning how to make our dogs WANT to follow us can make us better parents, coworkers and partners in a relationship!\nSucceeding at making our dogs WANT to follow us WILL greatly improve our quality of life!\n\"The other end of the leash\" is one of the best books I've ever read and one of the first I recommend to EVERYONE!!!\n\"Domination\" may work in the short term and it is the method of choice for people who are insecure, uneducated and lazy.\nJust like we have to work on making our dogs 'want' to follow us.... we also have to work on making American dog owners 'want' to learn how to be better and more effective leaders to their dogs.\nWe must remain open to learn at all times and that includes learning how to inspire our neighbors and relatives and friends.... to become better dog owners as well.\n\nthe list of rules not to do...\nIs pretty disgusting to think people still do and promote such nonsense. My heart breaks for any dog that has an owner that would treat them like that.It's that mentality that continues to be promoted and why there are sooo many dogs with isues.\nIt all begins with the 1940's wolf pack research and mans quest to dominate everything (he thinks he so smart)\nok the furniture can be considered but even that's a personal preferance if you ALREADY have a good dog it won't make a differance.\nIf we all open our eyes we will see ALL canine species are designed to cooperate (not dominate) and that's what they do 99% of their time.If dominance was the rule,there would be no dogs left on our planet.\nIf we can just stop all the TRAINING concepts and dominance,submissive and subordinant human conduct,the world will be a better place for millions of dogs and people alike.\nLook at natural dog...do you see any of them training each other/", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "b9e6572a-5c50-4b69-8f62-ae59be6d1a78", "url": "http://thebark.com/comment/30391"}

In a kayak, however, it is often even more efficient to simply switch over to a forward stroke on the opposite side, adding a bit of sweep component if necessary, especially if one wants to maintain forward momentum or move back up onto the trough of a surf wave.

Weight gain during pregnancy is less important than a woman's starting weight and not gaining enough may be more harmful.

{"text": "share this story\n\nThere is an old maxim that, \"the more things change the more they stay the same.\"\n\nUnder the guise of preventing voter fraud, Governor Rick Scott of Florida is taking actions that will potentially impact the right of many Black people in Florida to vote and influence the outcome of the 2012 presidential election. Obviously, as Florida is the biggest swing state in the country, the stakes couldn't be higher.\n\nPotentially abusing the law and implementing policy that may end up discriminating against black people, the Scott administration's continuing efforts to suppress minority voters harkens back to the extremist legacy of Jim Crow era politics. We thought we had seen the end of Jim Crow with the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965 -- Federal laws passed to stop the practice of discrimination of African-Americans and subsequently other racial minorities -- however, it appears we may have been wrong.\n\nUnfortunately, perhaps we shouldn't be surprised, as Florida has become infamous when it comes to suppressing the voting rights of Black people.\n\nIn 1865, Florida's constitution limited the right to vote to 'free white males.' However, while the 14th Amendment granted equal rights to newly emancipated slaves, Florida's powers-that-be developed apportionment practices that actually diminished Black voting power. Furthermore, in 1885, voting rights were tied to paying a poll tax, which disproportionately hurt the poorest (and overwhelmingly Black) citizens of the state and, on top of that, African Americans who attempted to register to vote were subjected to various forms of harassment and intimidation.\n\nFast-forwarding to 2011, Florida's legislature passed an omnibus voting bill that impacted how organizations and individuals registered their friends and neighbors to vote, along with cutting back on early voting days -- again, as it cut out the last Sunday before Election Day, this act disproportionately affected Black voters due to the tradition of African Americans voting after church, a practice which is known as 'souls to the polls.' In Florida, 54 percent of African-American voters exercised their franchise during early voting. So, perhaps it is no wonder that these laws are being challenged by civil rights and voting rights organizations.\n\nNow, in 2012, and despite the proclamation of a 'colorblind' America, the extreme actions of the Sunshine State's Governor could systematically undermine the voting power of African American and Latino citizens. By creating his 'purge' list, Governor Scott is intending to generate a snowball effect of greater voter suppression. His actions could create an environment that challenges the rights of registered minority voters based on a growing, manufactured hysteria around voter fraud. If allowed to succeed, it will turn the clock back to a more shameful time in our great state's history.\n\nReverse the Purge\n\nRick Scott and his Secretary of State, Kurt Detzner, have moved to throw more gasoline on the fire of voter suppression by what has been criticized as racial profiling of the voter files.\n\nAnd, this isn't the first time that a Republican Governor has pulled this trick in our state.\n\nNow famous in the annals of voter suppression, some 12,000 lawful voters were erroneously identified as ineligible to vote and purged from the voter role in the year 2000, with AfricanAmericans accounting for 41 percent of citizens stripped of their rights. Also, in the year 2000, George W. Bush was declared the winner of the presidency over Al Gore by a mere 537 votes, which means, well, you do the math...\n\nScott claims he's trying to prevent voter fraud and is only attempting to stop non-citizens from voting but, what he has actually done is put 182,000 lawfully registered, and mainly minority, voters' heads on the block.\n\nOn May 8, the State mailed 2,7003 letters to Florida residents informing them, \"You are not a United States citizen; however you are registered to vote.\" Well, it turns out that the list included a 91-year-old WWII vet and a 60 year old woman, born in the far distant country of Ohio, who has been registered to vote in Florida for more than 40 years. Alarmed by this flawed, and probably illegal process, Florida's Supervisors of Elections have halted any cooperation with the purging process, and the U.S. Department of Justice has moved to sue the state and halt the purge. Furthermore, there has been a bipartisan response from elected officials throughout the state to oppose this Jim Crow-esque effort of suppression. Even the bemused Republican state senator, Mike Fasano said that \"no one could give me an example of all this fraud they speak about.\"\n\nUltimately, despite the lack of evidence so far of any voter fraud whatsoever, Governor Scott stands defiant to both law and reason. Looking at the situation one can only think that, rather than being the champion of democracy he claims, his true motivations are more sinister and malicious.", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "4fe53ef5-09cf-4c2a-be5e-466219e17e5d", "url": "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/badili-jones/purge-jim-crow-politics_b_1619178.html"}

{"text": "The Mystery of Fascism\n\nIn the 1930s, the perception of \"fascism\" (13) in the English-speaking world morphed from an exotic, even chic, Italian novelty (14) into an all-purpose symbol of evil. Under the influence of leftist writers, a view of fascism was disseminated which has remained dominant among intellectuals until today. It goes as follows:\n\nFascism is capitalism with the mask off. It's a tool of Big Business, which rules through democracy until it feels mortally threatened, then unleashes fascism. Mussolini and Hitler were put into power by Big Business, because Big Business was challenged by the revolutionary working class. (15) We naturally have to explain, then, how fascism can be a mass movement, and one that is neither led nor organized by Big Business. The explanation is that Fascism does it by fiendishly clever use of ritual and symbol. Fascism as an intellectual doctrine is empty of serious content, or alternatively, its content is an incoherent hodge-podge. Fascism's appeal is a matter of emotions rather than ideas. It relies on hymn-singing, flag-waving, and other mummery, which are nothing more than irrational devices employed by the Fascist leaders who have been paid by Big Business to manipulate the masses.\n\nAs Marxists used to say, fascism \"appeals to the basest instincts,\" implying that leftists were at a disadvantage because they could appeal only to noble instincts like envy of the rich. Since it is irrational, fascism is sadistic, nationalist, and racist by nature. Leftist regimes are also invariably sadistic, nationalist, and racist, but that's because of regrettable mistakes or pressure of difficult circumstances. Leftists want what's best but keep meeting unexpected setbacks, whereas fascists have chosen to commit evil.\n\nMore broadly, fascism may be defined as any totalitarian regime which does not aim at the nationalization of industry but preserves at least nominal private property. The term can even be extended to any dictatorship that has become unfashionable among intellectuals. (16) When the Soviet Union and People's China had a falling out in the 1960s, they each promptly discovered that the other fraternal socialist country was not merely capitalist but \"fascist.\" At the most vulgar level, \"fascist\" is a handy swear-word for such hated figures as Rush Limbaugh or John Ashcroft who, whatever their faults, are as remote from historical Fascism as anyone in public life today.\n\nThe consequence of 70 years of indoctrination with a particular leftist view of fascism is that Fascism is now a puzzle. We know how leftists in the 1920s and 1930s thought because we knew people in college whose thinking was almost identical, and because we have read such writers as Sartre, Hemingway, and Orwell.\n\nBut what were Fascists thinking?\n\nSteele proclaims five facts about Fascism:\n\nFascism was a doctrine well elaborated years before it was named.\n\nFascism changed dramatically between 1919 and 1922, and again changed dramatically after 1922.\n\nFascism was a movement with its roots primarily in the left.\n\nFascism was intellectually sophisticated.\n\nFascists were radical modernizers.\n\nFascism is an offshoot of Marxism that repudiates most of the tenets of Marxism, in much the same way that Unitarianism is an offshoot of Christianity that repudiates most of the tenets of Christianity:\n\nIn power, the actual institutions of Fascism and Communism tended to converge. In practice, the Fascist and National Socialist regimes increasingly tended to conform to what Mises calls \"the German pattern of Socialism.\" (32) Intellectually, Fascists differed from Communists in that they had to a large extent thought out what they would do, and they then proceeded to do it, whereas Communists were like hypnotic subjects, doing one thing and rationalizing it in terms of a completely different and altogether impossible thing.\n\nFascists preached the accelerated development of a backward country. Communists continued to employ the Marxist rhetoric of world socialist revolution in the most advanced countries, but this was all a ritual incantation to consecrate their attempt to accelerate the development of a backward country. Fascists deliberately turned to nationalism as a potent myth. Communists defended Russian nationalism and imperialism while protesting that their sacred motherland was an internationalist workers' state. Fascists proclaimed the end of democracy. Communists abolished democracy and called their dictatorship democracy. Fascists argued that equality was impossible and hierarchy ineluctable. Communists imposed a new hierarchy, shot anyone who advocated actual equality, but never ceased to babble on about the equalitarian future they were \"building\". Fascists did with their eyes open what Communists did with their eyes shut. This is the truth concealed in the conventional formula that Communists were well-intentioned and Fascists evil-intentioned.\n\nFascism failed to reach its own stated goals — even if we ignore the war:\n\nFascist ideology had two goals: the creation of a heroically moral human being, in a heroically moral social order, and the accelerated development of industry, especially in backward economies like Italy.\n\nThe fascist moral ideal, upheld by writers from Sorel to Gentile, is something like an inversion of the caricature of a Benthamite liberal. The fascist ideal man is not cautious but brave, not calculating but resolute, not sentimental but ruthless, not preoccupied with personal advantage but fighting for ideals, not seeking comfort but experiencing life intensely. The early Fascists did not know how they would install the social order which would create this \"new man,\" but they were convinced that they had to destroy the bourgeois liberal order which had created his opposite.\n\nEven as late as 1922 it was not clear to Fascists that Fascism, the \"third way\" between liberalism and socialism, would set up a bureaucratic police state, but given the circumstances and fundamental Fascist ideas, nothing else was feasible. Fascism introduced a form of state which was claustrophobic in its oppressiveness. The result was a population of decidedly unheroic mediocrities, sly conformists scared of their own shadows, worlds removed from the kind of dynamic human character the Fascists had hoped would inherit the Earth.\n\nAs for Fascism's economic performance, a purely empirical test of results is inconclusive. In its first few years, the Mussolini government's economic measures were probably more liberalizing than restrictive. The subsequent turn to intrusive corporatism was swiftly followed by the world slump and then the war. But we do know from numerous other examples that if it is left to run its course, corporatist interventionism will cripple any economy.\n\nFascism was a dress rehearsal for Third Worldism:\n\nItaly was an exploited proletarian nation, while the richer countries were bloated bourgeois nations. The nation was the myth which could unite the productive classes behind a drive to expand output. These ideas foreshadowed the Third World propaganda of the 1950s and 1960s, in which aspiring elites in economically backward countries represented their own less than scrupulously humane rule as \"progressive\" because it would accelerate Third World development. From Nkrumah to Castro, Third World dictators would walk in Mussolini's footsteps was", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "0a5b0bd3-130d-4357-84e1-14f37190bee4", "url": "http://www.isegoria.net/2014/04/the-mystery-of-fascism-2/"}

{"text": "Judaism and the Human Genome Project\n\nNow that we have the \"genetic operating manual\" for homo sapiens, where will it take us?\n\n\"Today,\" President Clinton declared at a recent White House ceremony, \"we are learning the language in which God created life.\"\n\nNo, he didn't mean Hebrew, although that would have been a nice touch. Clinton was referring to the human genome, the multi-billion-letter \"operating manual\" for homo sapiens that scientists have finally deciphered -- surely the most eagerly awaited literary release this side of Harry Potter.\n\nThis cracking of the genetic code promises to revolutionize medicine, but it also raises a host of moral and ethical questions that Judaism speaks to. The genome, for example, will no doubt help us better understand human behavior -- and misbehavior -- by identifying its genetic components. Consider where that might take us. Fast-forward to the year 2015: Is it farfetched to imagine, say, enterprising defense attorneys concocting \"genetic defenses\" for their clients?\n\nJudaism's position runs counter to the societal tendency to diminish personal accountability.\n\nJudaism wouldn't buy it. Our tradition maintains that biology is not destiny, and therefore holds people accountable for their actions -- whether or not they have whatever syndrome is momentarily fashionable. There are legitimate mitigating factors, of course, such as mental incompetence, but Judaism otherwise consistently affirms the ability of people to exercise their free will and make moral choices. In fact, in general the Talmud says a person is always liable for his actions, whether awake or asleep.\n\nUnfortunately, Judaism's position runs counter to a growing societal tendency to diminish personal accountability, often using medical or psychological \"explanations\" to excuse evil deeds. Does the term \"Twinkie defense\" ring a bell? That argument was used in a celebrated 1978 case by an attorney who maintained that his client was driven to commit murder by his addiction to junk food.\n\nTime will tell whether the human genome is abused in this and other ways. The possibilities are endless. Will it be used, for example, to invade individual privacy through the unauthorized release of sensitive genetic information? Moreover, will man use it to play God through selective breeding or the engineering of desirable traits?\n\nAs for privacy, Judaism certainly values it -- to the extent that it opposes even subtle forms of snooping. The Torah speaks of the evil prophet Bilaam praising the Israelites for dwelling arrangements that prevented unwanted intrusions and other invasions of privacy.\n\nNo one is fit to play God, genome-enhanced expertise notwithstanding.\n\nFinally, and perhaps most importantly, no one is fit to play God, genome-enhanced expertise notwithstanding. This category, however, does not include a wide range of scientific endeavors, such as legitimate medical intervention and research, which Judaism encourages. The human genome promises to be an invaluable tool in this area. What Judaism discourages is interfering with God's natural plan for no good reason. This theme is reflected in the Torah, which forbids the mixing of distinct plant and animal species. Disrupting the natural order is not only arrogant; it can be downright dangerous, too. It's common sense. It's also the law -- the law of unintended consequences.\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nAbout the Author\n\nRichard Greenberg, a freelance journalist in the Washington, D.C., area is the author of the book \"Pathways: Jews Who Return,\" published by Jason Aronson Inc.

On the one hand this knowledge has a limitless potential for fighting diseases and birth defects. On the other hand there is also a limitless potential for its misuse and abuse. Do we want scientists trying to engineer genetic \"supermen\" or perfect soldiers. Do we know enough about the relationship between genetics and the soul to be experimenting with it? Science and technology are good things, but they must be based in morality. A scientist must be able to recognize the limits beyond which it is not safe to go. They must also be able to recognize the potential for the misuse of knowledge and power, and human weakness in being able to deal with these responsibly.\n\n(5)\nAnonymous,\nFebruary 23, 2001 12:00 AM\n\nKnowledge in itself is neither goog or bad.\n\nOf course man can misuse knowledge but to say that for this reason alone all scientific research should be stopped is absurd.No body can deny the immense blessings science has showered on our lives.Knowledge is neither good or bad in itself but depends on our use of it.I pray to the Supreme that he may give us the goodwill and spiritual understanding to employ knowledge for the highest good.\n\n(4)\nRobert Smith,\nOctober 11, 2000 12:00 AM\n\nAbdication of Respons-ability\n\nWith the acceptance of genetics as deterministic factors in behavior, mankind will have self-absolved himself of all manner of sin and taken yet another step towards the day when he shall prolcaim that he is greater than the Almighty.

See M.addClass in jqmath-0.4.0.js for what I do instead inside jqMath - basically I call element.setAttribute('class', ...) on XML elements, which is equivalent to your addClassML.

{"text": "If I am remembering correctly, yes, you could possibly but only to the extent it is used for business purposes. Example: If you use your truck for business 60% of the time it may be possible to write off 60% of your truck note. Or you can take the milage deduction for the milage used for business purposes. Problem with writing off a \"percent\" would be come audit time. IRS will want you to have a written record proving that your truck was used 60% of the time for business. REally the only way to substantiate that use would be to have a milage log. So since you are keeping a milage log, why not take the standard deduction for milage? Heck, with the miles I put on my truck for business use I am deducting way, way more than I could if I was basing it on my truck note (which is quite large) and a percentage of use. And again, I would need to keep up with the miles anyway. Best ask an accountant though. And remember the burden of proof for any deduction is on you, the taxpayer... not the IRS.\n\nWhat kemco said is exactly correct, not much more you could learn about it than what he said. If I remember correctly the mileage deduction is $0.58 per mile, so at the end of the year that's pretty substantial. Keep track of your mileage and that's really all you need to do. Ask an accountant too though\n\nIt all depends on how you do your taxes. The simple answer is yes of course you can write off your truck...

{"text": "Complete Works of Geoffrey Chaucer\n\n4.11 - 1251 ratings - Source\n\nIt is impossible to overstate the importance of English poet GEOFFREY CHAUCER (c. 1343 c. 1400) to the development of literature in the English language. His writings which were popular during his own lifetime with the nobility as well as with the increasingly literate merchant class marked the first celebration of the English vernacular as a tongue worthy of literary endeavor, most notably in his unfinished narrative poem The Canterbury Tales, the format and structure of which continues to be imitated by writers today. But the impact of Chaucer s work was felt even into the 16th and 17th centuries, when the first major collections of his writings set a high standard for how authors should be presented to the reading public. This widely esteemed seven-volume set first published in the 1890s by British academic WALTER WILLIAM SKEAT (1835 1912), Erlington and Bosworth Professor of Anglo-Saxon at Cambridge University is based solely on Chaucer s original manuscripts and the earliest available published works (with any significant variations or deviations between versions highlighted in the extensive notes), and comes complete with Skeat s informative commentary on many passages.

{"text": "George Stinney: Pronounced Innocent 70 Years After His Death\n\nGeorge Stinney was 14-years-old at the time of his execution in 1944. 70 years ago, in the small town of Alcolu, South Carolina, the young boy was killed via means of electrocution. Stinney was so small that he had to sit on a stack of books in order to fit on the electric chair. Yesterday, According to NBC, Judge Carmen Mullins threw out the murder conviction.\n\nThe African American teen was convicted of the murder of two young white girls. Allegedly, he had beaten 11-year-old Betty June Binnicker and 8-year-old Mary Emma Thames to death. Back in day, the white and black neighborhoods of Alcolu were divided by railroad tracks. The girls were last seen riding their bicycles on a search for flowers. Upon passing the Stinney property, the girls asked George and his sister Katherine if they knew where to find \"maypops,\" a type of local flower. Several hours later, when they didn't return home, they were announced missing, prompting the police and hundreds of locals to organize a search party. The two girls were found dead the following morning in a ditch, with severe head wounds caused by being hit repeatedly with a railroad spike.\n\nGeorge Stinney was taken into custody the following day, where he would await an 81-day confinement period. The trial itself was all of one day. Since the Supreme Court didn't guarantee the right to counsel yet (it was passed in 1963), Stinney was questioned in a room by himself, without his parents or an attorney present. His father fled town after being fired from his job and was forced to abandon his son and family under the threat of being lynched. The only evidence, or a lack thereof, against the young boy was from the three police officers who testified that he did indeed admit to the killings. There was no physical or DNA evidence pointing to Stinney, who received a guilty verdict after the speedy two-hour trial, with no witnesses. At 7:30 p.m. on June 16, 1944 Stinney was executed. He held a Bible under his arm when walking into the execution. He stood 5 foot 1 inch atjust over 90 poundsat the time of his death, which took all of four minutes. Witnesses reported that the over-sized mask actually slid off the boy's face during the horrific moments, which exposed his wide-eyed, tear-stricken face to the crowd.\n\nThe case was reopened in 2004 by George Frierson, an Alcolu native and local historian. He joined lawyers Steve McKenzie and Matt Burgress to file for a motion for a new trial in 2013. They successfully completed this on Dec. 17, 2014, leading to Stinney's name being cleared. There have been several films and books about the case that point to Stinney's innocence throughout. David Stout's novel Carolina Skeletons was adapted into a movie with the same title in 1991. Pleroma Studios is in works to create the film 81 days, produced by Ray Brown, to show the world what really took place during Stinney's prosecution.", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "fb7ab695-a6f9-44bd-9176-e42583e04a58", "url": "http://www.blackenterprise.com/news/the-youngest-boy-ever-executed-america-was-just-exnoerated/"}

{"text": "Would You Give This Kid $500,000?\n\nJared Kim has just finished lunch at a Thai place in San Francisco's dotcom district. The check paid, he steps out onto the sidewalk of busy Brannan Street, pauses, and says, \"I just hope there's no 9/11 in the next week.\" Kim has been promised a first round of funding for his latest startup, WeGame.com, a sort of YouTube for videogamers. Everybody's giving him a thumbs-up, and the papers are supposed to be signed within a week, but Kim is nervous anyway. A major terrorist attack killing thousands of innocent people could scuttle the deal.\n\nOnly someone with a teenage mind-set could personalize fears of a mass tragedy with such an offhand, casual form of solipsism. Kim is 19, an age when narrow self-absorption is tolerated (barely). Moreover, terrorism aside, he has little reason to worry about funding. If anything, it's easier than ever to find money for a startup, particularly one like his—a small, Web-based company with relatively low launch costs. Despite the credit crunch on the East Coast, there's plenty of money sloshing around Silicon Valley these days. Venture capital firms have more than they can invest: About $20 billion was raised in the first nine months of 2007. And while the vetting process remains intact for companies seeking significant backing, investors are also making lots of low-stakes bets on small companies without performing the same sort of intense due diligence. In January, Bay Partners created a $300 million fund, its 11th, a slice of which is set aside for 20 to 30 investments of up to $250,000 each.\n\nThat doesn't sound like much, but the ever-decreasing cost of computing power, bandwidth, and servers means that new companies—especially those based on the Web—don't require as much capital. \"The same website that cost $5 million in 1995 to scale up to peak costs $250,000 today,\" says David Siminoff, a general partner at the Menlo Park, California, venture capital firm Venrock Associates. Because of these factors, Silicon Valley has hundreds of new companies, with names like Meebo, Hive7, and Eurekster, plus a universe of startups still in the development stage, like Kim's WeGame.", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "eeadd0e2-b86f-42dc-900c-9b98a6b8e2f6", "url": "http://upstart.bizjournals.com/executives/features/2007/11/19/Jared-Kim-Profile.html"}
{"text": "Somewhere, and I can't remember where, someone called this FANTASY. If you ask me the incredible artistry of Wayne Reynolds captures the FANTASY of Feiya. To expect the back story to logically fit the image is way too much REALITY for me. I really like both back story and image. But to each his own.\n\nEh? Why have a backstory at all, if it's not meant to \"logically fit\" the image?\n\nI like the back story, and I like the image, I just didn't think they necessarily go together that well. Don't misjudge me, though: I'm not saying you cannot enjoy this depiction of Feiya, only that I personally have some cognitive dissonance with it.\n\nAbraham spalding wrote:\n\nHonestly go look at what abuse does to people -- her looks literally scream, \"I'm been victimized brutally.\"\n\nWell, I think that is your opinion (and you certainly have a right to it!) For me, when I look at Feiya, I see her smirk, and that she is looking the viewer right in the eye, and that she is wearing revealing and impractical clothing (which is not wrong or improper but not necessarily the M.O. of the abused and socially awkward.) To me that is not the look of the abused who is just now stepping into the world, but of a confident young woman who is self-assured and knows what she's doing.\n\nQuote:\n\nIll fitting clothing found from wherever and frayed? Check.\nLong finger nails from not trimming? Check.\nFalse Bravado stance and attitude to cover insecurities? Check.\nDesperate need for attention (typically the wrong kind too) as demonstrated by same clothing? Check.\n\nNow this doesn't go for everyone... but I'm not surprised in the slightest that she looks how she does given her background.\n\nI can see why you feel the way that you do. However, when I look at her backstory I don't necessarily see someone who is \"desperate for any attention\", I see someone who would be perhaps somewhat shy and at times overwhelmed but very enthusiastic. Why would she want the \"wrong kind\" of attention, when she's just now escaped from years of beatings?\n\nThere is nothing wrong with Feiya's look. I simply didn't expect her to have a backstory that involves severe social ineptitude and random inflicted violence. In my experience, people who are \"desperate for attention\" are usually more the results of neglect than violence.\n\nI'm not trying to attack you for your opinion, only expressing my own feelings, and I'm not pushing for Pathfinder to become Social Workers & Sadness. (If anything, I would have dropped the \"kidnapped + recently abused\" story and injected about 75% more \"pulpy badass.\") If it helps you understand where I'm coming from, I'm a psychology major. It's unfortunately difficult for me to shut my brain off and just enjoy things at face value.\n\nAnyway, ladies and gentlemen, I just want to reiterate that I'm not trying to attack others for holding \"wrong opinions\", or that I dislike Feiya's look or story, or that I dislike Pathfinder. I'm only expressing my own surprise, not expecting anyone else to conform to my opinions.\n\nThis is a really interesting and well-written backstory, but I have a hard time reconciling what is presented here (kidnapped, abused young woman venturing out for the first time, socially stunted and completely unaware of to expect in the outside world) with her portrait (confident woman with a sly smirk looking the viewer in the eye, wearing somewhat revealing attire accented with strange hair pieces and a small \"voodoo\" doll, complete with impractically long finger nails.)\n\nI would have said the witch presented in the portrait knowingly pursued her mysterious powers and relished in presenting herself to onlookers as a \"creepy outsider\", whereas I would think the witch presented in the story would want to integrate into the attire of places she visited, both to prevent unnecessary confrontations and as a way of enjoying her freedom from the hags--and would certainly not dress akin to the hags who violently kidnapped and beat her.\n\nStill, I'm happy to see another iconic's background. Thank you for your hard work. :)\n\nMy boyfriend and I became friends through roleplaying. Our gaming group at the time was just under 10 people, so during game we tended to split into logical groups--all the characters from a particular church sat together, all the characters infiltrating the castle this session sat together, etc. BF and I tended to have a similar approach to problems so we'd often be grouped together. We would sit there, listening to whatever one of the other groups was doing, and then get to chit-chatting. Over time it became clear that not only did we have a lot in common gaming-wise, but that we loved a lot of the same shows and video games. Of course, then we started hanging out outside of game, and eventually going out.\n\nTo be honest, our relationship did cause a rift in that group. One of my ex-boyfriends was part of that group, and though he had dumped me over half a year ago and had a girlfriend, my new relationship made him insanely jealous. He constantly accused my boyfriend of talking about him behind his back (which we didn't do, because we were much too busy talking about Battlestar Galactica), and demanded that we sit apart during game so as not to force our relationship down everyone's throat.\n\nHis behavior escalated into spying on me and breaking into my room, so yeah, I left that gaming group.\n\nBut, I'm still going out with that boyfriend! We even run each other game. It's pretty great. :)\n\nExcept what I've been asking for is for more diversity. Not some uniform innoffensive grey, but examples of people presented as people, not lumped under homogenous descriptors, and showcasing the positive and negative aspects of these cultures and what they're capable of.\n\nI'm completely with you, Mikaze.\n\nWhy should trying to expand the number of stories that can be told in Golarion be a bad thing?", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "f3280edc-b905-43ed-8fbd-ebcd386903c4", "url": "http://paizo.com/people/shyDM"}

{"text": "Well, that was an odd one, wasn't it? The Boston Bruins took NBC's first 2010 playoff game this afternoon 5-3 in a game that may come back to haunt the Buffalo Sabres.\n\nAt first, it seemed like it was going to be a leisurely stroll through Limp Offense Park for the Sabres. While the Bruins seemingly tripped over their own feet, Buffalo took what looked like a commanding 2-0 lead in the first period (after all, the last game ended 2-1 right?). The scope of the game seemed to change in the second period when Ryan Miller allowed a pop-up goal. Soon after, the game was suddenly 2-2 while the Sabres went from red-hot to eerily blank.\n\nThat being said, the Sabres went up 3-2 at the end of the second period, prompting everyone (myself included) to reference their death grip on late leads. Still, the oddness remained in the air from the second period. The Bruins scored two goals in exactly two (hockey) minutes to take a 4-3 lead they would never relinquish.\n\nUltimately, the Bruins scored an empty net goal to complete their 5-1 run during the second and third periods. Now, it's worth noting that losing home ice advantage as you go into Boston is less imposing than one might think; after all, the Bruins finished a paltry 18-17-6 in Beantown during the regular season. That being said, the Sabres could be without their leading goal scorer Tomas Vanek, who left today's game after crashing into the boards. Two tough losses in one bad afternoon for Buffalo.\n\nWho knows, this might just be a rare slip-up in a feel-good journey for Miller and Co. My guess is that whether this series ends in 5, 6 or 7, the Bruins won't make things easy, though. Remember: this is the playoffs. Anything can happen.

{"text": "Search\n\nAccording to Merriam-Webster online dictionary, a \"public\" is \"a group of people having common interests or characteristics; specifically: the group at which a particular activity or enterprise aims\".\n\nPublics are very important to the field of Public Relations. It is the job of a public relations professional to stay in tune to the public. Basically, if you are a living, breathing person who ventures outside of the door, you are bound to be a part of some public at least. The more active and social you are, the more publics you can become part of. The publics that I belong, just to name a few, include the student population of Southeastern University, the public of my church (the Vine), and Starbucks.\n\nSoutheastern University- Since I am enrolled at SEU, I am automatically considered part of their public. Southeastern aims to please its students and retain them at their institution. Consequently, events on campus, new regulations, professors, administration, all work together to create an academic, spiritual and social environment in which the students of Southeastern University may thrive.\n\nChurch- Growing up, I have always been an active member in my church. Here in Lakeland, I attend The Vine. I would definitely consider myself to be in their public since I actively attend and take part in some of their activities. When planning events, writing sermons, etc. The Vine considers their target audience (those who actively attend), which I am apart.\n\nStarbucks- From my blog title, I'm sure you've already assumed my fascination with the wonderful coffee drinks that Starbucks create.

{"text": "Thursday, November 14, 2013\n\nDanse Macabre--chapter 23\n\nAnita is watching Cookie Monster AKA Haven walk over to her bed.\n\nIt's kind of obvious how consistantly LKH dehumanizes sex objects in this series. I'd say \"male sex objects\" but women get objectified a lot too. They're not as frequent because Anita is straight, but every time there's a woman onscreen and she's attractive, she's objectified on some level. The only women who are allowed to be likable people are the ones who are either teacher figures, or LKH's definition of unattractive. (And FYI a key sign of a sociopath is someone incapable of an equal relationship with a non-attractive sex. If they cannot make a sex object out of a person, they assume either a student/submissive role, or a teacher/dominant role. Straight women sociopaths will have female teachers and female students. Gay ones will, I assume, be either a student of men or a teacher. They will never have peers of a gender they do not want to seduce. A sociopath is incapable of sustaining a peer-to-peer relationship because you CANNOT bullshit a peer for very long. If you've got a same sex/non attractive sex buddy who keeps your relationship on a student/teacher dom/sub sort of level, be EXTREMELY careful with that individual. And there's nothing \"cool\" or \"edgy\" about being a sociopath. It's a shitty situation for everybody involved, including the sociopath. I don't give LKH credit for characterization for this. It's too obviously inadvertent.) In fact, I'd go so far as to say that one reason all the women who aren't Anita are made repellant is being made an object of scorn is still a form of objectification. Still, if women are pieces of shit in this series, guys are just dildos. And LKH has taken the personification of a male lion/bodyguard for the truly dangerous and reduced him to a Sesame Street Tattoo.\n\nAnita describes sexual attraction through the eyes of her inner lion.\n\nYou know, one thing that's always bugged me about most shapeshifter stories is how the alternate form is treated as a separate personality. Like this person's got DID and one symptom is that they change form completely. I love shapeshifter fiction, but I don't like that. Even in Patricia Briggs, every time Anna Cornick starts going off on her wolf (or worse, Charles. Talk about DID) I kind of start tuning out. I think this is less a snark thing and more a YMMV.\n\nIf I let the lion think it could boss me around, would that set a bad precedent for later? Then a thought came to me; the lion was me. I was fighting with myself. How terribly Freudian, or would it be Jungian? Either way, how strangely me.\n\nCongratulations, Anita. You've employed two schools of psychology without bothering to understand what either of them mean. I think you'll like Freudian thought better. And LKH? The whole symbolism thing loses all its power when you bash it over our heads like a clue-by-four. AND KEEP YOUR HANDS OFF JUNG THANK YOU KINDLY.\n\nThe thought was so me, that it opened my eyes. Cookie was standing beside the bed. His hands were at his sides. The look on his face was eager, but wary, as if he'd finally figured out that something might be wrong. His blue hair was flattened on top as if he'd been asleep when I'd called him. His eyes were very blue as he stared down at me. I could see the tattoo on his left shoulder now: the faces of Bert and Ernie. I sensed a theme. \"Any more tattoos?\" He grinned.\n\n\"Yeah, want to see?\"\n\nOne: These paragraphs are consecutive.\n\nTwo: What did Sesame Street ever do to Laurel K. Hamilton. Did it sodomize a sex fantasy of hers? Was she watching during the episode where Bert and Ernie finally came out of the closet? Is she now obsessed with the stalker U from the \"U got a hold on me\" video? Is all that sweet innocence, positivity and light too much for mz. darkety dark goth to endure? Because it must be a deep set grudge to not only involve Bert and Ernie, but to momentarily imply that Big Bird might be referring to Haven's penis.\n\nI think it must be her daughter's favorite show.\n\n(Seriously. I once babysat for a kid that watched the last twenty minutes of \"Space Jam\" for eight fucking hours. That ranks up there with listening to the Jackson 5 sing Christmas Carols and waterboarding. I think murdering a child's favorite show because you'd rather have bamboo shoved under your nails than hear the theme song one more time is sometimes an approprete response. I just want to know what set this off.)\n\nCookie turned to him, frowning. \"I don't understand.\" His nostrils flared, as he scented the air. \"She smells like lion, but she smelled like leopard earlier. She smelled like wolf, too.\" He shook his head, as if clearing his mind from the scent. He looked down at me, frowning, speaking softly. \"What are you?\"\n\nAn uber-special Mary Sue with the boundaries and sexual proclivities of a termite.\n\nJean Claude explains Anita's super speshulness by saying that she absconds with the Animal to Call of vampires she fucks. Which is actually a better explanation than \"You have four strains of were-whatever in your bloodstream and this is like catching HIV twice in this universe, so we're going to go find a nice bunker now and get back to you when science starts working again\". It'd remove the impossibility, the broken universe, AND give Anita the excuse to nab whatever animal LKH got on her calenders this year. (Hippos. Please God. I want were-hippos. Steve motherfucking Irwin was scared of the motherfuckers. Mail LKH all the hippos.)\n\nThe conversation continues. And continues. And continues, and Anita is lying naked on the bed while a massive number of strangers watch her writhe in pain.\n\n\"Don't mistake force of will for stubbornness,\" Micah said. \"There is a difference.\"\n\nMy parents had a lot of teaching books when I was a kid. The Big Book of Virtues was one, but my favorite was this book on being stubborn. It had four situations in it, and in the first three the kid involved refused to get on a waterslide, try new things, or play with new people, and the book showed the reader how that was all wrong...but then it lead into a situation where the kid was absolutely right to be stubborn and explained why it was okay to dig in under that situation. My point? Other than mentioning an awesome teaching book whose title I wish I could remember? Being stubborn isn't always bad. Also: IDK what the difference is when employed in this context. Also: if we're not having sex, can somebody please pass out panties?\n\nAnita gives her lion to Haven. She's now covered in the mucus goo from three different shapeshifters. Do not tell me that the shapeshifter exploding thing is not a metaphore for ejaculation. It explains too much.\n\nHaven takes a few post-shift moments to check out Micah's penis.\n\nWe have to know this. It's important to the non-plot.\n\nHaven says the \"Fringe benefits\" Of hanging with Anita had better be awesome, and then takes great pains to make sure we all know he means sex.\n\nAnita and Richard pick a fight over paternity and being together and how much he wants her and I'm really sorry, but this couldn't broadcast \"not over it\" any harder if it was a Bruno Mars \"love\" song, and I'm not talking about Anita and Richard. Jesus fucking Christ, I do not want to read this shit into the book but it is so obviously fucking there. Factor in the rape scene from Narcissus and what that would actually mean, and every interaction with Richard is just a big pile of nope.\n\nAnita and Richard take a moment to say \"I love you\" followed by \"I hate you\" and the chapter ends.\n\n3 comments:\n\nI know a person who must end the relationship or else as far as they are concerned the relationship is not over, in that they continue to bother, badger, and browbeat their ex for several years after the divorce, and even after both parties have remarried occasionally resurfaces to give a little grief over nothing. I suspect LKH is one of these types. You wonder how many ulcers they have.\n\nI didn't know this about sociopaths and it's very, very interesting, especially in regards to Anita\n\nI've noticed that about shapeshifters in UF too, so I decided to run with it to make the animal actually indeed something separate that lives in them---they're magical psychic parasites in my universe that result from prehistoric shamans dicking around with spirit animals, and the human body is the host, which they share with the original human consciousness. And occasionally force into shapeshifting of their respective animal type to suit them better. So there really is a for-real separate thing inside shifters with its own wants and needs and it's pretty damn constant :D Not just an occasional thing, or one that makes you wonder \"wait, why is the protagonist talking about 'my inner wolf' what\"\n\nAnother weird thing about these books is how often a ton of people climb in to bed with Anita, followed by exactly zero sex. LKH talks the talk but she can't walk the walk. She never really drives home with her darkety dark and that in turn makes it creepy for all the wrong reasons.", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "fca9331c-5973-4367-bf82-c3681f02591c", "url": "http://creativedoubledipper.blogspot.com/2013/11/danse-macabre-chapter-23.html"}

{"text": "Jewish Wisdom on Raising My ADHD Son\n\nEach of us is given different traits, inclinations, capabilities. The only question is: what do we choose to do with them?\n\nI am the mother of that boy, the one makes teachers drink more coffee and take an Advil before they enter the classroom. The one whose mother sees the school number on the phone display and never thinks: Is he sick? Rather she just wonders: What has he done now?\n\nDon't get me wrong. My son is one of the most adorable children you can ever hope to meet: a bright-eyed, cheerful imp who is adept at charming people off their feet. He is also truly caring and generous. Unfortunately, all these wonderful qualities can suddenly go into hiding and all you'll see in him is his severe case of ADHD.\n\nBefore he got his diagnosis, his behavior kept baffling me. He was my first child and I was so proud of him: of his quick wit, advanced vocabulary, friendly demeanor…and yet I couldn't understand him. How could such a smart child behave so badly? How could a child with a giving, loving nature bite a friend because of a silly disagreement? How could a child who hugged me so tightly defy me minutes later?\n\nAs sweet and wonderful as my son is, he has a very hard time always behaving in the way we expect children to behave.\n\nThe ADHD diagnosis gave me the answer. As sweet and wonderful as my son is, he has a very hard time always behaving in the way we expect children to behave. ADHD is far from being a disorder which only affects attentiveness; it is a disorder of executive functions. Children (and adults) with ADHD find it immeasurably more difficult to do things like self-regulate their emotions, plan ahead, or use working memory.\n\nWhile there are many things that we are doing to help him (and yes, medication is one of these things) I used to worry almost obsessively about my son's future. I needed to know what the likeliest outcome was for a child with the kind of ADHD which made him stand out everywhere.\n\nI read the statistics and the anecdata till my head hurt. People with ADHD are more likely to end up in prison…but they are also likely to be successful entrepreneurs. People with ADHD are involved in many more accidents…but they also demonstrate remarkable creativity. Some books and websites tried to tell me that ADHD was a terrible disability. Others tried to sell the idea that it was a tremendous gift. I didn't know whom to believe. I didn't know which of the pieces of information I found applied to my son. I didn't have a crystal ball, but how much did I wish that I could see into the future and sooth my anxiety!\n\nOne day while once again letting worry get the better of me, I recalled a Talmudic saying I had read some years ago. \"A person who is born under the astrological sign of Mars will have a tendency to spill blood… he will be either a surgeon, or a criminal, or a butcher, or a mohel.\"\n\nThink about it. How would you feel if you were given such a diagnosis: \"Your child was born with a tendency to spill blood…\"? Wouldn't you be freaked out?\n\nYet the Talmud does NOT freak out. A tendency to spill blood? Just another trait. And the one who has this trait can be average, righteous – or wicked. Just like any other person.\n\nThat was when the penny dropped for me. There is nothing inherently good or bad in my son – nothing inherently good or bad in any of us. We are given different traits, inclinations, capabilities. The only question is: what do we choose to do with them?\n\nMy son is not obedient by nature. Unlike other children, he is not inclined to bow his head respectfully just because someone is older, bigger, or scarier than him. Is that necessarily a bad thing? Too many of us, after all, spend our life showing respect and deference to certain people just because they are bigger, richer, or more influential. My son, on the other hand, is not likely to ever fall into that error. Yes, he needs to be taught respect and humility, but when he will show respect it will only be because he has internalized the moral duty demanding that. He will never show respect out of fear or inferiority feelings.\n\nOr take his abundant energy. A child who can't sit still in the classroom is disruptive to their teachers and peers, but life in general is not much like school. One should, of course, invest their energies in the right thing, but what a blessing it is to have prodigious energies and use them for the right cause! Think of it as doing good with a racing car engine instead of with an electric bicycle engine. How often do we all wish that we could do just a little bit more? A person with ADHD can often do a great deal more – and without getting exhausted.\n\nYes, my son has unique challenges, but none of this determines his future.\n\nEven traits like rule-bending and boundary testing have their positive sides. There are rules which must not be bent and boundaries which will never change, but many things in life are more flexible than that. In many areas of life, every progress that has been achieved was due to people willing to challenge old assumptions and to disregard common wisdom. Many experts, for instance, believe that Albert Einstein had ADHD. It can definitely explain the fearless way in which he revolutionized physics. So what if something had been held true for hundreds of years? That alone would never be a consideration for most people with ADHD.\n\nI do not, of course, expect my son to turn out to be an Einstein. I have no idea what kind of person he is going to be – nor do I know that about any of my other children. But the Talmud's message about traits has helped me to stop fearing the future so much. Yes, my son has unique challenges, because he has a unique set of traits. But none of this can determine his future.\n\nInstead of worrying, all I should do is parent him as well as I can, pray that he will always exercise his free will wisely, and believe that he is capable of greatness – just like any other child.\n\nThe opinions expressed in the comment section are the personal views of the commenters.

It tells ADD like it is, but it presents so many positive things about ADD and the people who are \"blessed\" with it. I don't think either of these doctors are Jewish, but the book definitely echoes the Jewish way of thinking about this.\n\n(3)\nAnonymous,\nMarch 20, 2017 12:47 AM\n\nAll may turn out well\n\nI'm the father of two sons, one with ADD and the other, the younger, with ADHD. From what you wrote, I think your son's (invisible) disability is more severe than those of my sons., too, was baffled by the older son's sudden nursery-school misbehavior. Fortunately, we found a psychologist and psychiatrist who helped. When I was fretting about giving him behavior-altering medication, a friend whose son also had ADD asked me: \"If he had diabetes, would you give him insulin?\" Medication -- and some counseling with a child psychologist -- helped enormously, so much so that we had to tell his teachers of his ADD; they said they hardly could notice. Our second son's problems more severe. Again, medication helped, but still, he has a little trouble letting go of an idea until you agree with him, and he laughs far too loudly.My sons now are 35 and 32. They never have gotten into trouble, and the younger son is the sweetest guy in the world -- always willing to help us as he's doing while I recover from surgery that limits my mobility. Our sons are smarter than my wife and me added together. (ADD usually occurs in very intelligent children.) Our older son has a Ph. D. and is seeking a tenure-track position while trying to pay the bills from the exploitation wages of a college adjunct teacher. Our younger son, who always had to sit in the front row of the classroom to pay attention, is a mechanical engineer with a master's degree and a new job at a major medical-device company at an annual wage that exceeds the best I ever did. I'm not telling you this to brag but to try to give you hope that with proper medication, appropriate attention in school (a school psychologist should be involved and every teacher has to be informed every year) and proper counseling, your son may, indeed, become a happy, well-liked successful adult.\n\nHang in there, and best of luck.\n\n(2)\nAnonymous,\nMarch 19, 2017 11:51 AM\n\nRe: The school phone number on the phone display\n\nMy now adult child has high functioning autism.

{"text": "We've been tracking the progress of WebRTC (real-time communication) since the API standard was first announced by Google two years ago, and in that time we've seen lots of predictions and promises about how this standard is going to disrupt the UC world. To make sense of these myriad views, it's important to understand two other business trends, namely BYOD (bring your own device) and the growing remote workforce. BYOD may conjure up images of employees bringing their devices to work, but it's important to recognize that more and more work is happening outside the four walls of the business office. Although business owners want to accommodate employees' needs to work remotely and their desires to use their own smartphones and tablets to access email and other business applications, the need for secure and reliable voice and video communications remains imperative. Now more than ever, businesses need to collaborate with remote workers to achieve their business objectives. With these trends and business needs in mind, we can begin to see where WebRTC will have its greatest impact.\n\nFollowing are two distinguishing characteristics about WebRTC that make it appealing to businesses that rely on remote voice and video communication with their employees and/or clients:\n\nIt's inherently secure. Unlike traditional security applications that often require users to \"accept\" and install updates manually, many of the leading browsers automate that step. So, the next time you launch your favorite browser, you're opening the latest version of the browser - including all the latest bug fixes - without any extra steps on your part. As such, WebRTC being browser based supports only SRTP (secure real-time transport protocol) by default, which uses encryption and authentication to minimize the risk of denial of service attacks. The main premise for this decision is the fact that a call is private at all times, not an option that someone should have to select.\n\nIt promotes stronger session authentication. Traditional video communications environments rely on third-party relay media servers to manage sessions in order to traverse firewalls. WebRTC establishes a peer-to-peer reliable session even through NAT's (Network Address Translation), therefore eliminating the need for third-party communications servers. This has traditionally been a problem for SIP-based VoIP systems.\n\nWhile businesses are able to adopt traditional proprietary UC technologies that enable secure and reliable communications from within their video conferencing rooms, extending these capabilities to remote workers is where traditional business technologies fall short. Through its use of open standards, WebRTC has the potential to extend the features and benefits of traditional (i.e., proprietary) voice and video communication solutions to a much wider audience.\n\nCIO, CTO & Developer Resources\n\nI was encouraged from the feedback I heard recently at the Enterprise Connect trade show, which included a well-attended WebRTC \"Conference Within a Conference.\" Discussions around WebRTC did not focus on its cost, video quality, or speed, but rather on the transformative impact WebRTC could have on customer service, remote worker support, and B2B and B2C applications. Although this standard is still a little ways away from being ready for primetime, I'm encouraged by the fact that those most interested in adopting it are focusing on what WebRTC is going to be most helpful for, which is driving the traditional UC experience beyond the four walls of the enterprise. For more information and insights on WebRTC, be sure to check out our free white paper titled, \"3 Things You Need to Know About WebRTC.\"\n\nVishal Brown is vice president of professional services for Yorktel, a worldwide provider of UCC, cloud and video managed services, including enterprise-grade videoconferencing-as-a-service, unified communications and collaboration", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "0b7ee4e7-0482-45fc-abe1-c038eb6951c5", "url": "http://openwebdeveloper.sys-con.com/node/3083216"}

{"text": "Meet Mark Rastetter, M.D.\n\nThe University of Dayton's mantra of \"Lead, Learn, Serve\" is one that is repeated to its students many times during their time as undergraduates. The university hopes the message will guide students in both their current and future endeavors. For UD alumnus Dr. Mark Rastetter, \"Learn, Lead, Serve\" has become an integral part of his life.\n\nRastetter, who graduated from UD in 2002 with dual degrees in biology and religious studies, received his medical degree from Loyola University Chicago in 2006. While in medical school, he became involved with Physicians for Human Rights and began clinical work with underserved populations. Since finishing his residency in Family Medicine in 2009, Rastetter is now completing a fellowship in Maternal-Child Health that combines additional training in obstetrics and pediatric care. This fellowship allows Rastetter to continue to help the marginalized and poor, something he found a desire to do while still in Dayton.\n\n\"As a student at UD and then at Loyola University Chicago Stritch School of Medicine, I sought the type of education that would allow me to lead and serve effectively. I have always tried to use my skills to create a preferential option for the poor, a tenant of liberation theology and one I learned while at UD,\" he said.\n\n\"The education model that I experienced as a biology and religious studies major at UD, I feel pushes students to work hard and focus, but allows it to happen within a supportive community of students, faculty and staff…I sought that sort of model in my medical education and continue to seek it in the work that I do in my professional career.\"\n\nRastetter has also dedicated his time and skills through medical relief work in communities in Africa, South and Central America and the Caribbean. Most recently, he worked in Malawi, Africa in March 2010 to help serve the mother and child population of the area. In January 2010 he traveled to Haiti, a country he first visited while as a UD student participating in a cultural and service immersion program, to assist victims of the 2009 earthquake.\n\nRastetter still considers the experiences he had at UD as an undergraduate to be defining moments in his career, and named Carissa Krane as a key mentor.\n\n\"I remember not only extensive discussions about my research projects, but also about ethics, human rights and becoming a physician,\" he said. \"Dr. Krane continually encouraged me to explore the reasons I wanted to enter medical school and challenged me in my essays and personal statement. Looking back…those conversations proved to be some of the most important of my career.\"\n\nBesides undertaking his fellowship and work abroad, Rastetter is also a clinical instructor in the family medicine department at Northwestern University, a position that also furthers his vocation to assist the impoverished.\n\n\"In this role, I have had the opportunity to work with medical students and have been involved in the creation of a new family medicine residency through Northwestern dedicated to the underserved,\" he said.", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "cbe2c5f7-0463-48b8-87e8-92a42bc35608", "url": "https://www.udayton.edu/artssciences/academics/biology/alumni/alumni_profiles/rastetter.php"}

{"text": "Reviewing Financial Products & Services That Empower You!\n\nAn informed consumer\n\nConsumer Whereas consumerism per se is a wide concept not confined to enforcement only but about prevention, consumer information, safety, consumer education, redressal rights and related consumer aspects. The enforcement through consumer forums has its own peculiar role. Beyond that when we talk about the consumer rights \"information\" on related aspects of consumer rights plays a vital role for a consumer. Information from a consumer prospective means to have information relevant for pre purchase till post purchase.\n\nAn intelligent purchase requires bit of pre purchase product research. When we say research it means that you can go through a general consultation and a little inquiry about the product. It also includes somebody you know who has purchased the product recently. This off hand information can be very useful. At pre purchase stage consumer must get adequate information in respect of the market which is best for a particular range of products. There is range of dedicated websites providing well informed reviews of the product and experts comments. Even on TV channels there are dedicated consumer programs which give immense useful information and guidance.At the same time you should by your decision keeping in view your needs and budget.\n\nYou can also have product information from the regulatory authorities under the Right to Information Act. By making a simple application with requisite fee you can get all information in relation of your product if it is endorsed. The endorsement generally granted by the Govt by granting ISI mark, Star Rating, AGMARK etc. For example, if in a electric product, start rating has been given and you have doubts about the energy efficiency you can get related information from the Govt. Department. In case of food item AGMARK is granted you ask for basis on which it was granted. You can also question and ask for the information the test conducted by the officers before such grant.\n\nInternet is a useful resource to get relevant information about the product. In present market scenario no company can survive without having a user friendly website. Website contains lot of information which gives such information which is generally not available with the shopkeeper or showroom. The attention paid to the product can be more to understand the specification in comparison to having it purchased at shop. You can understand the various important popular terminologies which are of great help to make an informed decision. Although after all such information gathering, you feel cheated about any thing, then you can post online consumer complaint as well to safegaurd your consumer rights\n\nNext comes being informed about the excellence, amount, effectiveness, wholesomeness, standard and price of goods or services so as to protect the consumers against unfair trade practices. No one can charge you more than the MRP written on the product and at the same time it is mandatory for the company to print MRP on any electronic gadget and is also valid for services as well. If someone charges you more than the MRP printed on the product, you can post consumer complaints with the weight and measurement department and to the consumer court as well.\n\nConsumer rights on our side to safeguard our valuable rights. But it is said that \"prevention is better than cure\". So, we can equip ourselves with bit of awareness and knowledge which can go long way to save our valuable time, money and harassment at the hand of seller and service provider.", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "d61d2e00-4539-48ec-9550-eb01b8188fea", "url": "http://people-finance.com/an-informed-consumer/"}

{"text": "Help with SSL and Composite\n\nI am having trouble after installing composite using my shared ssl. Before I installed composite, the shared SSL that my site has worked great. Here is what I am finding:\n\nIf I browse my website from the ssl url - the browser just spins unless I give the SSL user account modify writes. But then I can access my website using the SSL url but the browser will just spin when using the non-ssl url.\n\nIf I then take the SSL user account permissions back (removing the Modify rights) and reset the application pool - the non-ssl url works and the SSL does not.\n\nThe Website is running ASP.net 4.0 after the install of composite. The SSL website is ASP.NET 2.0 with has the APPLICATION that points back to my websites directory.\n\nI have multiple website running composite that are on different builds using version 2.1.3. The website with the oldest build works just fine. I can access the website using either the non secure url or the Web application on another website\n(shared ssl). The other website with the same version but later build do not work (with the same settings and permissions). I then downloaded version 3 and installed fresh.. I get the same effect as the later version 2, the web application\ndoes not load. As a side note, I had the web application working just fine with v4 application pool and then when I installed composite the web application stopped working. I also found a post from Tuesday that document the same error: \n\nCould this be a version/build issue? Both the regular website url and the web application website (shared SSL url) works on my v 2.1.3 build 2.1.4169.29910 composite website and doesn't work on versions/builds after that? The versions that don't\nwork - If I access the website first with either of the URLs the other url then will not load. If I clear restart the application pool, I can access either URL again and get the same issue with the other url. The error is the Global Resource Lock....\n\nI am confused as to how this could work on the one version/build and not any of the other build that were released after. Same web content, IIS7 setup & permissions.... Has anyone else experienced this?\n\nCan anyone shed any light on this? I just can't understand why one version works and another doesn't? They are set up the same way? I really need to get this to work for this website with is running v 2.1.3 build 2.1.4182.27104. Frustrating.....\n\nDo you have two distinct IIS sites or apps pointing into the same folder?\n\nThe exception and your initial post could indicate that, and Composite C1 isn't designed for that setup. Dynamic compilations, temp files, updates to files etc. make such a setup \"volatile\". The exception you see is the result of a lock we explicitly do\nserver wide, using the directory as key, to ensure multiple processes are not running at the same time.\n\nWe only recently updated our\nsystem requirements with info about this restriction - sorry about not documenting this earlier.\n\nReferring to this disucssion  it also seems that C1 after a certain build-number got more sensitive to multiple sites pointing\nto the same installation. Not that its an excuse for keep using old versions to support this scenario, since you should never have several websites/application pointing to the same folder and database. Ever.\n\nThanks Mawtex and Burningice for helping clear my confusion. Is there a way to use a shared SSL with a composite website?\n\nIn IIS7, there is a website that has an SSL attached. My composite website is assigned a Virtual Path ( \"/mycompositewebsite\") that points to the physical path of my composite websites root. This also has an application pool of ASP.NET\n4.0.\n\nThanks again for you help. I am sure that this information can help many. Shared SSL are used a lot and provided with may hosted accounts.\n\nI'm not an expert on this, but I'd say that you would have to configure a single IIS site to host the shared SSL and the related domains. Only this will get you a situation where one process (iis application) is using the Composite C1 website directory.\n\nOnce you have your certificate and host names centered around one IIS site this should work out.\n\nI am looking to implement a shared ssl as well and this is quite disappointing to find out. When I was using Dot Net Nuke they had a spot to enter the shared SSL domain name and path to allow. Is there a way to create\na work around like this or create a module to do this? I have about 10 clients on Composite and finding this out really stinks. I can't afford to dedicate an IP per client and issue private SSLs.\n\nas i read aont's comment, these 3 sites are running in each their own app pool! I can't imagine what fix could make you run several app pools against the same site/folder/database. It would definitively require a lot of out-of-proc state management,\nwhere most caching today is handled in-memory inside each app pool.\n\nThanks burning ice, but I really don't believe it is all that. How are the other major CMS systems allowing shared SSLs.. All shared SSLs have their own app pool.\n\nBecause we host a bunch of sites on our private server farm, we can afford (nor does our clients want to pay) to dedicate an IP to each client just so they can have a shopping cart or a secure channel for data transmission.\n\naeont, thanks for the suggestions I would love to see if they do work in both environments.\n\nThe wildcard domain ssl might work, but it is an expensive alternative. I will look into this option more and I appreciate your efforts.\n\nHi @keyangler\nI tested it again and it seems that the setup we suggested to you, doesn't work:\nC1 2.1.1: Works - but itsn't stable as C1 not designed to run under 2 AppDomains for the same folder\n\n\n\nC1 3.0.0: Doesn't work - as the limitation is now enforced.\n\n\n\nThat's the bad news, the good news are that's it is still possible to do (shared SSL + own hostname for a site).\nYou can do the following:\n1) ssl.mydomain.com = e:\\hosting\\mydomain\\ssl.mydomain.com\\wwwroot\\\n2) ssl.mydomain.com\\myclient = e:\\hosting\\myclient\\myclient.com\\wwwroot\\\n3) myclient.com -> here you should create a reverse proxy that will channel requests from  to \nYou can either rewrite an existing reverse proxies to meet your needs, like f.e. that one\n (may be you can find something better)\nOr you can try to configure IIS7 to do the job:\n\n\nIsCan I use a wildcard ssl and bind a subdomain to each website? Meaning myclient.com and have myclient.ssldomain.com both bind to the same website...\n\nWhat do you think?\n\nIs it just the way composite is built? How is DNN allowing a shared ssl through asp.net?\n\n>> IsIf you really want to try running 2 application domains, try the following.\n\n1) Get the sources of the necessary version, find AppDomainLocker class, and \"clear\" it's public methods/properties, so the result would look like:\n\n4) The changes above should give some basic console stability. The only issue left is caching, for the moment the changes done in console may not appear right away on the site which is running in another AppDomain.\n\nI still thing that writing a proxy would be a more stable solution.\n\n>> Can I use a wildcard ssl and bind a subdomain to each website? Meaning myclient.com and have myclient.ssldomain.com both bind to the same website...\n\nYes, but still each application would have to have own virtual folder, f.e.\n\nmyclient.ssldomain.com/mycliend/\n\nmyclient2.ssldomain.com/mycliend2/\n\n>> Is it just the way composite is built? How is DNN allowing a shared ssl through asp.net?\n\nIt is not the \"shared SSL\" that is the limitation, the limitation is to have 2 processes (or 2 AppDomains) running the same site at the same time.\n\nEither in DNN they completely don't use caching (which I doubt), or you just haven't experienced the issues there are. But that doesn't mean that they aren't there, exactly as in the case you haven't noticed them by running C1 2.1.1 on 2 AppDomains", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "29f70061-16e5-48b8-9f89-2dc09e2521a5", "url": "https://c1cms.codeplex.com/discussions/275504"}
{"text": "Every day of every month is a good time to think about the wildflowers, the natives and self sown immigrants that make the garden robust and diverse. The fourth Wednesday of each month has been designated as Wildflower Wednesday by my dear friend and fellow world traveler Gail of Clay And Limestone. Do feel free to join in the fun by poking about your own garden or out in the wild to see what can be seen, even as the plants fade to khaki colored carcasses.\n\nStill lovely for a couple more months is the Pink Muhly sonogram, Muhlenbergia capillaris. The lower light rising in the Eastern sky illuminates the morning dew held by the inflorescens, creating an image that reminds one of an ultrasound, showing a baby in a human belly, in pink. It must be a girl!\n\nMost of the wildling goldenrods, Solidago ssp. have been pulled or cut to prevent total takeover by the scattered seeds, but late blooming and still attracting pollinators happy yellows must be allowed to live a bit longer. The wild white asters add to the festive scene.\n\nIt is the late to the party crowd that appears in November. Somehow they misplaced the invitation, but we are glad to see they decided to grace us with post frost flowers. Echinacea tennesseensis 'Rocky Top' with the recurved petals is not all that happy here in the acid clay, minus the limestone it adores. All flowers are a bonus.\n\nRabbit Tobacco, Pseudognaphalium obtusifolium, sometimes shown without the Pseudo, which means false, is evidence that the taxonomists are at it again. It is also known as Pearly or Sweet Everlasting among other common names, and is sporadic here in the Fairegarden. We save and spread the seeds for more of a mass planting, but this annual continually pops up elsewhere, like in the middle of a gravel path. It will stand through the winter, offering silvery contrast to the evergreen shrubs. I just wish there was more of it! The American Painted Lady butterfly is said to favor it for egg laying, reason alone to have a field of it.\n\nPlentiful and welcome is the wild ageratum, Conoclinium coelestinum, (honestly these names and the constant changing of them are getting on my last nerve!) and the colorful neighbor to the left. The ID of the rusty wildflower is unknown, but it has been allowed to colonize the slope of the middle terrace to the right of the concrete steps. Both are considered to be friends of the garden, already growing here when the human began interfering with the plantings.\n\nThe oxeye daisy, Leucanthemum vulgare, is another garden denizen grandfathered into the mix. It appears in every bed and blooms very nearly in every month. The evergreen rosette is easy to identify and can be moved safely in all seasons except summer to make for a mass planting. The yellow button mum is being quite chummy here, to everyone's delight.\n\nJust so you know, poison ivy wears fall colors that are not only shades of red. This bad boy is in dense shade under a Leyland Cypress and is bright yellow. It needs to be dealt with, sooner rather than later before the leaves are gone and it blends into the background.\n\nA rampant self sower, the spiderwort, Tradescantia virginiana, has a blue flower that cannot be resisted. It is a color that zings straight to our heart, but since world domination is in its genes, most must be dug out. It is difficult to get the entire root system and it regrows quickly. Watch out for it, but man, what a color.\n\nAnd now, do tell what wildflowers you have noticed this fine November?\n\n13 Responses to Lovely Late November Wildflowers\n\nOur spiderwort seemed to die back from the summer drought. Now is is thriving but not blooming like your. Thanks for the words about goldenrod, it has been poking up everywhere around here this year, now I know to cut it back before seeding.\n\nHi Randy, thanks for visiting. The spiderwort is a thug, we cut it back to the ground over and over, but it regrows right back. The one shown is in a protected spot between the hedges. Yes, do cut, or even pull the goldenrod. Ours spread by runners and we never get all the root so it grows back.\nFrances\n\nThank you Carol, and may you have a wonderful Thanksgiving as well. Thanks for catching that, I forgot to put that word in the text, reading it several times and not noticing it was missing! Busy here with the family coming. The muhly still has much to offer, even as the color fades. It catches moisture and light, or even dark, in a mystical way. There are still spots of color here, less of them, but pleasing. 🙂\nFrances\n\nAll my wildflowers have turned into khaki-colored carcasses, Frances, but they still have a certain appeal. Nothing to compare with your fantastic Muhly, though–it does look like a sonogram!\n\nHope your turkey has thawed and the pie dough is ready to roll out–wishing you and your family a very Happy Thanksgiving, Frances!\n\nThanks Rose. They are still pretty, even without color, in this low light. My turkey is not only thawed, but cooked, taken off the bones, broth boiling from the carcass. Cake, not pie this year, for a change. You too have a Happy Thanksgiving. 🙂\nFrances\n\nHappy Thanksgiving, Frances! I am thankful for your posts – always lovely to look at and educational as well.\n\nI now know that the volunteer that I like so well, and am grateful that I didn't weed out, is Rabbit Tobacco.\n\nHi Barbara, thanks and the same back to you! I certainly appreciate your kind words, very much so! When looking up the botanical name for the rabbit tobacco, I was surprised to find out about the Painted Lady butterfly. Now I am going to work much harder getting it to spread! 🙂\nFrances\n\nGreat idea! All our true wildflowers have finished here, tho.\nI wish I would have success with coneflowers. What do they need that I have not provided for them? 🙂 Beautiful dark red poison oak is a major potion of our fall color here in the mountains near Yosemite.\n\nHi Sue, thanks and welcome. I cannot answer the Echinacea question for you, sorry to say. This coneflower is different than E. purpurea, native to the cedar glades of middle Tennessee rather than my acidic southeast corner of the state. The regular coneflowers do fine here, but not the fancy colored ones. But that is okay. Most of the poison is lovely here too, pinks and reds, this yellow one tried to trick me! HA 🙂\nFrances\n\nThat first picture of the Pink Muhly is amazing it's like something from a day dream, I spent a while just gazing at it and imagining the feeling.\n\nThanks Kylie and welcome. The muhly still looks quite lovely and in the early AM, when the dew is thick on it and the sun comes up just so, it is a marvel. My poor camera skills don't do it justice. 🙂\nFrances\n\nI think your Hardy Ageratum's mysterious neighbor is Acalypha virginica. I will not share any joy you have for this plant, as I spend much of my weeding time at work trying to eliminate it from the beds.\n\nHi Les, thanks for the ID. It can pop up in unwanted spots for sure, but in the part of my garden where it is being encouraged, the toughest of conditions, surrounded by ironweed, miscanthus and fothergilla, it makes a good groundcover. Might as well go with what wants to grow here anyway.", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "bf2faa8f-150f-47ce-8944-ca51ae602d21", "url": "https://fairegarden.wordpress.com/2010/11/24/lovely-late-november-wildflowers/"}

I dunno man XD\n\nI haven't put a big nerdy informal fandom-y essay up in a while (I'm still working at the meme post, don't worry ^^) so I figured hey, why not.\n\nHokay. So. Here's de erfno no no no wrong introductory sentence. *donk* Most people are probably familiar with Super Castlevania 4, even if they haven't played it. Released in 1991, ostensibly the fourth game in the series (it's actually the seventh released game), oddly marketed as a sequel to the original Castlevania though in actuality it's a re-imagining of that game.\n\nWeirdness 1: The English opening title crawl makes it seem as if Simon's been around for 100 years on account of some seriously funny wording. This isn't present in the Japanese one. There are other differences as well - you can find a list of them on Mr P's site, or here. But anyhow! No, Simon isn't 100 years old (we think XD) in Super Castlevania IV; if he were that'd put the game in 1791 and then we'd have Richter and Simon squabbling over the map trying to work out how best to proceed and Simon calling Richter a young rapscallion1 and Richter snickering at that and then you'd have a large Belmont squabble that lasted the whole quest and no one wants that.\n\nAhem. Srs tiem nao. I promise.\n\nTHAR BE SPOILERS HYARR for SCV4, CV2 and 3, and CoD among other games. So yeahSo it looks like the new DS Castlevania has a badass fighting femme protag. Unto this is say MWOO HAA HAA HAA YEAH BABY. I wish Shanoa has a whole shirt but I suspect there'll be significance to her tattoos or something so I'll leave off my 'but - backstab - dang' concerns for the time being. besides she looks speedy enough to avopid back attacks nine times out of ten, so. :3\n\nI suspect there'll be some whining from ninnyhammers (when is there ever not) but I'll file that where it belongs. (FOR ME TO POOP ON!) Funnily enough, despite the retconning of Sonia (I'm sorry, Iga, but women did whip ass in historical contexts - Fa MuLan, the Celts, Anne Bonney and Mary Read, Grainne O'Malley...), Castlevania has a much better record of dealing with tough women than do a lot of games that come from the 'enlightened west' - Japan's no utopia of tolerance and equality by a long shot, but they at least realise that women (a) can kick ass, and (b) do have sex drives.\n\nBut anyway.\n\nWARNING AHEAD OF TIME: if some snot-nosed little dimbulb decides it'd be oh-so-clever to get into accusations of misandry and shit up in my comments, I will take great pleasure in publically dressing 'em down and revealing them to be goddamned fools. I've explained MANY TIMES what I think of this society's crappy attitude toward women and men at length and if people are too cretinous to comprehend that I am fullstop anti-bigotry, they should GTFO.

{"text": " recenctly bought a my book 500 gig drive and it is usb.\nthe firsttime I plugged the usb cable in it worksed. I had only a 40 gig ide harddrive and so I ordered an internal 500 wd hard drive to replace it. The internal 500 gig is a sata drive. first I cloned the 40 to the sata 500 and then copied the external 500 to the internal. I mover the cables to then make the internal 500 sata my boot drive. The computer would no longer show the external e\\when i used the windows explorer. the device manager said it was there and working with no problem but windows did not see it.\nAfter several experiments with diferent configurations I have concluded my motherboard wasauto configuring the external and internal 500 drives as drive 0. Since the usb was detected first and was notthe boot drive then windows assigned the internal drive as drive 0 and since the usb drive was drive 0 also it would not work. windows ignored it. my solution was to return the ide as the boot drive and plug the sata into a slave port. with that configuration both drive are seen and work normally. It took me several days to find this arrangement. so since my sata ports are auto configure and the external has a sata connection i will install an esata port adapter and try to hook it up as a slave sata drive so i cab\\n use my internal 500 sata drive as my boot drive.\nsorry this was so long but it is my solution to what others may be facing.\n\nAs you did not specify 2.5\" or 3.5\" I will give you both sets of steps:\n\nIf it is a full sized hard drive and requires power, it may not be getting enough power, have the AC adapter tested at a computer shop. If it is dead/dying replace it, if not move onto the next step.\n\nTry a new usb cable, also available at most computer shops. If the new cable works at the shop try your old cable as well. If the old one doesn't work, buy the new cable, problem solved if it does work the problem is either in the caddy or your computer.\n\nAssuming it's in the caddy, now have the people at the shop swap the HDD from your shell into a new one and test the drive again, as with the above if it works you're done. If it doesn't the problem is internal to the actual HDD. Time to buy a new external drive and send the old one for recovery if it has any crucial data on it.\n\nLet me know how you make out and if needed I will provide additional steps. Also if you need data recovery help let me know your region and city and I will recommend an appropriate facility.\n\nI have solved a similar problem to this. My laptop would not allow me to get to my WD Passport. The driver was fine and no errors were reported - it recognised the drive when I ran the hardware removal utility - I just couldn't see it from any of my windows applications and therefore couldn't get to any data.\n\nThe problem was that the passport was being designated as E:\\ but my laptop already has a network drive mapped to E:\\. When I am in the office the computer connects the network drive to E:/ and so my passport automatically picks the next available letter - F:\\. Away from the office, the network drive is still buit shows as \"disconnected network drive\" and somehow the laptop gets confused into designating both the the passport and the disconnected network drive to the same letter. so the passport is not visible in My Computer.\n\nTo fix it I went to My Computer, right clicked on the disconnected network drive and select Disconnect from the options there. And hey presto the passport appeared!\n\nYou can see which letter your USB HDD is assigned in the device manager in XP. Right click on the device and go to the Volumes tab - click on Populate and the drive letter should be shown there. If that doesn't match what you see under that letter in My Computer it looks like you have a similar problem & so disconnecting whatever is there in My computer might help.\n\nUnplug it and plug it in to a different USB port, shut down the computer and while the computer is off, turn on the drive.\n\nThen restart windows with the drive on, now after windows starts, wait about 5-10 minutes, if the drive does not start to blink, (the light), then go to there website and get there hard drive Diagnostic disk, you can. A wizard should load. If not there is refresh icon on the toolbar you\n\nWhen it hit the floor it either knocked the reader arms loose or damaged them in someway or possibly damaged the Plates inside the drive. Unfortunately, in most cases it will cost more to repair the drive than it will to replace it.

{"text": "Saturday, May 02, 2009\n\nUnder Attack\n\nStorm with a Shipwreck_Claude Vernet\n\nAmericans are under attack again from another foreign borne force. A new strain of swine flu has come across our borders from Mexico to infect us and kill many of us. So far there has been only one death in the United States but it was a Mexican child that was brought across the border into Texas that already had the virus. Let's face it folks Mexico is a toilet and it's a no wonder people are dying there from this flu strain. The hygiene and cleanliness in Mexican cities is virtually unheard of. Mexico City is one of the most crowded cities in the world and much of it can be described as squalid. My question is now what do we do? Our country is in a in a state of free fall from common sense. We have people in our own government holding the opinion that we should have open borders and it's probably going to happen given the outlook of our lame brain President.\n\nAt this point we aren't sure how this flu is going to spread and how many people it will affect while running it's course. One thing is for certain though, there will be a lot of liberal hand wringing down in Washington DC on whether to do the right thing or whether they will do the politically correct thing. The common sense thing to do is to shut down the borders tightly with Mexico and keep it closed until they clean up the sewer they call a country. Hey, just because you're poor doesn't mean you have live in squalor. The Mexicans have had all the opportunity to take their country into the 21st century. They however still insist on living in a third world country in spite of all the opportunities they are afforded with free trade with the United States and the natural resources they have. The thing that angers me the most is the Mexicans come flooding across our borders looking to better themselves but then they try to turn this country into the same toilet they just came from and wonder why we get so pissed off about it. If nobody else will say it I will; stay the hell in your own country and keep your squalor to yourselves.\n\nWord, I'm not as concerned about this swine flu as I am more serious disease that become a pandemic. Mexico just can't seem to keep it's own house clean and then they spread it to the rest of the world.\n\nYou live in California you know this is true. On one side you have San Diego and modern city with all the latest technology to have clean water, sewage, and health care. You just hop right across the border and your standing in the middle of a toilet. You can catch Tuberculosis, hepatitis, cholera, and Motezuma's revenge if you're stupid enough to drink the water.\n\nI can't say that I blame people for wanting to get the hell out of there but then they come here and do the same stuff here bringing with them their drug dealers, corruption and disease. We have enough of our own corruption here just look at the present administration.\n\nTom, Obama is so enamored with himself he can barely pull himself away from the mirror how is he going to notice millions of illegals if even cared too.\n\nHi ya Tom, nice to hear from you. Funny how busy we get so busy with our lives but still maintain our steadfast beliefs.I'll stop on over your political blog and have a read. I've stopped over at Patterns from time to time and I always admire the stories and the way you write them.\n\nAbout Me\n\nI'm a practicing Christian, US Navy Veteran and dedicated American.\nMy parents were simple but hardworking and honest people.\nMy Grandmother Gallagher had a huge influence on my life and what I believe.", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "6975a617-8bb5-4c9d-ba13-e61b444a78f4", "url": "http://nowforsomethingdifferent.blogspot.com/2009/05/under-attack.html"}

{"text": "Hey, loving your children is good but thinking they're better and more special than other children – God's gift to the world – could ultimately backfire.\n\nSo check that uber-praise at the door because kids who are overvalued are at risk of having an over-inflated ego, report researchers at Ohio State University.\n\nThe study shows that efforts to raise a child's self-esteem with heaps of praise may actually be raising levels of narcissism instead.\n\n\"If a parent constantly praises a child's work, that child may become a praise junkie and constantly look for affirmation and validation from others,\" and then resent those who don't tell them how wonderful they are all the time, says psychologist Sara Dimerman.\n\nConsider a small push off the pedestal now! \"Sadly, we are raising a generation of narcissists. Narcissists often have very poor self-esteem. Tragic,\" says Dr. Barbara Greenberg, a teen, adolescent, child and family psychologist who blogs about this issue on drbarbaragreenberg.com.\n\n\"The problem with much of parenting today is that we focus on our children and their accomplishments rather than teaching our children to be part of a community of peers, families and adults,\" says Greenberg.\n\nAnd we're failing to teach empathy, she says, adding that a lack of empathy is associated with narcissism.\n\nNarcissism and entitlement are connected, says Deborah Mecklinger, a professional coach at walkthetalkcoaching.com. \"Parents who believe their kids are better than others often teach them that they are entitled to play by different rules.\"\n\nThey get the message that the regular rules of the road don't apply to them, says Mecklinger. \"Free passes, short cuts, ignoring and or avoiding taking responsibility for behaviour and or actions are the preferred path.\"\n\nDon't be too hard on the parents though – most have good intentions and are just trying to boost self-esteem.\n\nHere are sure-bet ways to raise a narcissist, according to Dr. Barbara Greenberg and therapist Deborah Mecklinger:\n\nConstantly tell your kid how great she or he is.\n\nTell your kid that she is better than everyone.\n\nModel that the normal rules and consequences don't apply to your kids.\n\nTeach your child not to focus on how they affect others.\n\nYou don't have to wait your turn or wait in line.\n\nWe will use our connections to open doors for you.\n\nThey make you do errands at that job? Who do they think they are?\n\nI will get you out of that mess!\n\nAccording to Dimerman, it's normal for parents to see their children through rose-coloured glasses and to believe that their children stand out when with others.\n\nWhile previous generations of parents valued being humble, compliant and blending in with others, the pendulum has swung to the other side, says Dimerman. \"Nowadays, parents push their children not just to be their personal best but to outshine everyone else and to rise to the top.\"\n\nShe says this is understandable in light of strong competition in the university system as well as in the workplace. \"In other words, if you don't get the highest marks in your class or if you're not a leader, the thought today is that you will get left behind. This belief is not unfounded.\"\n\nHowever, in the process of raising children to be fierce leaders and better than the rest, she says that parents may unintentionally not be teaching other important values such as empathy, consideration for others and teamwork.\n\nMeanwhile, parenting coach Barbara Desmarais doesn't believe we're\n\nraising a generation of narcissists but she thinks parents can misunderstand what their role is when it comes to self-esteem.\n\n\"Telling your child he/she is more special than everyone is wrong and I can see how that could lead to narcissistic qualities,\" says Desmarais, of theparentingcoach.com.\n\nOn the other hand, \"telling your child he/she is special – and that we're all special – contributes to a sense of self-worth. Your child is special because we're all unique with our own likes and dislikes, personality traits, temperament, and so on, not because we're better than everyone else.\"\n\nAlthough it's important for us to acknowledge accomplishments, every small accomplishment doesn't require a big celebration, she adds.\n\n\"A three-year-old saying thank you is not an Academy Award performance, it's simply what you expect from her. And you treat it that way,\" says parenting expert Kathy Lynn.\n\nGood manners (age appropriate) and respectful behaviour are not special behaviours, they are simply what we expect from the kids, says Lynn. \"Children who are over-recognized for every action become children who always need the recognition", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "4980b305-db2f-470a-998f-b7b33f560a15", "url": "http://torontosun.com/2015/03/12/are-you-raising-a-narcissist/wcm/9d258449-72b6-4cba-a468-538bd574efe4"}

(Image source: Department for International Development/Pete Lewis)After broad-based slowdown in 2016, growth revival is underway across much of sub-Saharan Africa\n\nTwenty of the region's 45 economies are expected to grow robustly at five per cent or higher (mostly in eastern and western Africa) in the New Year.\n\nThe International Monetary Fund (IMF) regional growth outlook is at 2.6 and 3.4 per cent, respectively for 2017 and 2018 is similar to World Bank's projections. Growth in SSA excluding Nigeria and South Africa is higher, on average at 5.1 per cent in 2018-19, close to the levels seen since early 2000s.\n\nDeveloping Africa is a highly diverse regional economy; aggregate growth numbers for the New Year should fall into three divergent groups (see table 1):\n\n*High-achievers – where growth is driven by continuous infrastructure investment (Ethiopia), business-friendly reforms (Senegal and Rwanda), higher oil-gas production (Ghana), along with recovery in the agricultural sector and domestic demand. Elsewhere, growth is expected to recover in Kenya, as political uncertainty eases after the presidential elections and improve in Tanzania on upturns in public investment. Activity is also rebounding in countries hit by the 2015 Ebola outbreak (Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone). Ethiopia should remain Africa's fastest-growing economy over the coming years.\n\n*Mid-tier performers – where increased output and investment in the mining sector is supporting growth in metal exporters (Niger and Zambia), along with strengthening activity in services (Mauritius) and non-oil sector (Cameroon). Improved weather conditions in southern Africa will boost agricultural output (Mozambique and Zambia). The latter has benefited from recent rainfalls since hydropower sources account for 97 per cent of total electricity production in Zambia, according to the World Bank. But default on foreign debt by the Mozambique government has increased risk-premium, however, ENI (Italian oil major) in June 2017 approved final investment decision for the Coral floating (FLNG) facility in Mozambique, with nameplate capacity of 4.5bn cubic metres/year. The project will have a multiplier-effect on the broader economy.\n\n*Slow-growth lane – SSA's largest economies: Nigeria, South Africa, and Angola have exited recession, however, their pace of recovery remains tepid. Increased oil production thanks to stability in the Niger Delta (the country's oil-belt) and good harvest led to growth revival in Nigeria. Reforms in the forex markets will help the non-oil sector, which until 2014 was expanding at a brisk pace. An upturn in the petroleum sector too helped SSA's second-largest oil producer (Angola), although fiscal consolidation measures have slowed non-oil growth.\n\nThe normalisation of mining and agricultural production lifted GDP growth in South Africa, but policy uncertainty and low business confidence continue to hinder private investment. Faltering domestic demand also weighs on the manufacturing sector and high unemployment affects consumer businesses.\n\nActivity has weakened in most Central African Economic and Monetary Community (CEMAC) countries (Chad, Congo, Republic and Gabon) due to steep cuts in public spending. While deep recession has gripped Equatorial Guinea since 2014 caused by depressed oil revenues and rising debt levels.", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "7330372a-593d-4674-be9e-51ecdb5208d4", "url": "http://www.africanreview.com/finance/economy/regional-economic-activity-regaining-momentum?tmpl=component&print=1&layout=default&page="}

{"text": "STUDY SHOWS INCREASED RISK OF FATAL CRASH FOR THE ELDERLY\n\nOctober 11, 2016, By esperanzafiworsleyta9525@hotmail.com | Leave a reply\n\nA recent study released by a national research group and the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials shows that elderly drivers have a surprisingly high crash and fatality rate. The number of elderly drivers is predicted to triple in the next 20 years from Ohio car accidents, so studies on this driver demographic are important.\nEven though the elderly are an age group that is most likely to be involved in a deadly accident, they are also some of the safest drivers. In 2010, drivers age 24 to 64 were involved in the mostauto accidents: 3,125. Drivers age 16 to 24 were involved in 1,511 accidents and drivers over 65 had the fewest accidents at 950.\nElderly drivers' accidents are more likely to prove fatal, however, mainly because of the physical characteristics of being older. An accident that may only cause minor injuries to a 30-year old could put an 80-year old in the hospital because older drivers tend to have more fragile bodies and medical conditions that could complicate recovery from an accident.\nMany Chicago driving schools offer safety courses for those 65 and over. These courses work with seniors to get them more comfortable with changing traffic laws and norms. In addition to techniques for navigating icy Illinois roads and dealing with other poor driving conditions, one of the most important things that taught in these classes is simply learning to be more comfortable behind the wheel and more aware of the way other people on the road drive.\nSeniors shouldn't have to feel overwhelmed when driving, and many find taking a senior driver safety course to be an enjoyable experience as well as an educational one. A car accident attorney in Cleveland could also answer additional questions.", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "9ca71989-3fc6-4be1-8e01-00fb8afc7e3a", "url": "http://guthchris.com/study-shows-increased-risk-of-fatal-crash-for-the-elderly/"}

{"text": "Sunday, April 20, 2008\n\nThe card was created by the American Tobacco Company (ATC) between 1909 and 1911. ATC used the cards as a promotional tool to help sell their cigarettes. ATC required the permission of the players to create the cards and Wagner was highly sought after due to his status as one of the game's greatest players. Wagner, however, refused to let the production of the card continue and only 50 to 200 of them were put into circulation.\n\nAccording to an October 12, 1912 edition of \"The Sporting News\", Wagner responded to ATC's request by writing that \"he did not care to have his picture in a package of cigarettes.\"He further threatened to sue ATC if they produced the card.\n\nThere are a few theories as to why Wagner pulled the plug on ATC. The two leading ones are that he didn't want children to buy cigarettes to get his card and that he wanted more compensation from ATC.\n\nTheory #1 - Children Buying Cigarettes\n\nAlthough Honus Wagner chewed tabacco himself, he cared for his young fans and did not want them getting hooked on cigarettes and having his name associated with ATC. According to his granddaughter Blair, \"He loved children. He wanted to teach kids good sportsmanship. When it came time for that card to come out, it wasn't that he wasn't paid. He didn't want kids to have to buy tobacco to get his card.\"\n\nAnother supporting fact was that Wagner's manager, Fred Clarke, and Pirates owner Barney Dreyfuss both hated cigarettes. Dreyfuss actually passed on signing Tris Speaker, a future Hall of Famer, early in his career because Speaker was a smoker. It therefore seems likely that Wagner would not want to be associated with the tobacco industry.\n\nTheory #2 - Compensation From ATC\n\nOthers have speculated that ATC did not offer Honus Wagner enough money and he refused to go ahead with the card production. The theory has its flaws, however, as Wagner sent a check to the ATC representative, John Gruber, for $10, a substantial amount of money at the time, to compensate Gruber for the fee ATC would have paid him if Wagner agreed to create the card. Pundits ask why would Wagner have sent Gruber the money if he was holding out for more? Gruber, incidentally, never cashed the check and, instead, saved and framed it.\n\nWhatever the reason for Wagner refusing to cooperate with ATC, the card certainly would not have been as valuable if it has been put into full production. The limited number printed combined with the popularity of Honus Wagner and the story behind the ATC / Wagner battle have made it the most expensive baseball card in history.\n\nSunday, February 24, 2008\n\nOgden Nash was an American poet who the New York Times called one of the country's best known producers of poetry.

Some universities may charge at high as 1,220,360 yen ($10,000 USD or 9000 EUR), especially public universities, which are held in higher regard than private Japanese universities.\nHow Long Does It Take to Earn a Degree in Japan?\nStudents will be enrolled in a business-oriented undergraduate program for three to four years. Master's degrees in business my be earned in one year instead of the usual two, depending on how much academic work the student is capable of handling.\n\nWhy Earn a Business Degree in Japan?\nJapan's higher education system is internationally recognized as one of the best in the world. Consistently ranked in the top 20 of global universities are Kyoto University and the University of Tokyo, with 33 other Japanese universities placing on the Time's Higher Education list of 100 top Asian universities.\n\nTokyo is the capital of Japan and is a place where old and new come together to delight any visitor. In various places around the city, you can find active tea ceremonies, and multiple festivals happen throughout the year.

{"text": "What to Expect During Your Consultation\n\nThe success and safety of your breast reduction procedure depends very much on your complete candidness during your consultation. You'll be asked a number of questions about your health, desires and lifestyle. Be prepared to discuss the following:\n\nWhy you want the surgery, your expectations and desired outcome\n\nMedical conditions, drug allergies and medical treatments\n\nUse of current medications, vitamins, herbal supplements, alcohol, tobacco and drugs\n\nPrevious surgeries\n\nFamily history of breast cancer and results of any mammograms or previous biopsies\n\nWhat Happens During Breast Reduction Surgery?\n\nBreast reduction is usually performed through incisions on your breasts with surgical removal of the excess fat, glandular tissue and skin. In some cases, excess fat may be removed through liposuction in conjunction with excision techniques. If breast size is largely due to fatty tissue and excess skin is not a factor, liposuction alone may be used for breast reduction. The technique used to reduce the size of your breasts will be determined by your individual condition, breast composition, amount of reduction desired, your personal preferences and the surgeon's advice.\n\nAnesthesia\n\nMedications are administered for your comfort during the surgical procedure. The choices include intravenous sedation and general anesthesia. Your doctor will recommend the best choice for you.\n\nBreast Reduction Incision\n\nIncision options include:\n\nA circular pattern around the areola\n\nA keyhole or racquet-shaped pattern with an incision around the areola and vertically down to the breast crease\n\nAn inverted T or anchor-shaped incision pattern\n\nRemoving tissue and repositioning\n\nAfter the incision is made, the nipple, which remains tethered to its original blood and nerve supply, is then repositioned. The areola is reduced by excising skin at the perimeter, if necessary.\n\nUnderlying breast tissue is reduced, lifted and shaped. Occasionally, for extremely large pendulous breasts, the nipple and areola may need to be removed and transplanted to a higher position on the breast (free nipple graft).\n\nClosing the Incisions\n\nThe incisions are brought together to reshape the now smaller breast. Sutures are layered deep within the breast tissue to create and support the newly shaped breasts; sutures, skin adhesives and/or surgical tape close the skin. Incision lines are permanent, but in most cases will fade and significantly improve over time.\n\nBreast Reduction Results\n\nThe results of your breast reduction surgery are immediately visible. Over time, post-surgical swelling will resolve and incision lines will fade. Satisfaction with your new image should continue to grow as you recover.", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "34339647-f6c8-4173-9784-2f045fbfeafd", "url": "https://drusal.com/breast_reduction/"}
{"text": "Fitness health centre\n\nDoing the perfect press-up\n\nWhile fitness fads come and go, some types of exercise transcend trends. Among them is the press-up - sometimes known as the push-up - which uses your own body weight along with gravity to tone and condition muscles. With good reason, fitness experts have called the press-up the closest thing there is to a perfect exercise.\n\nFitness trainers say that one of the reasons the press-up has endured for so long is it's cheap, it's easy and it doesn't require any equipment. \"The press-up is excellent for building upper body strength and endurance and it's also fantastic for core stability,\" according to Simon Richman, fitness manager at British Military Fitness.\n\nRichman is not alone. Other experts are convinced that, when it comes to upper body exercise, the press-up is tough to beat. \"The press-up is a 'must-do' move\", says London-based personal trainer and fitness writer, Laura Williams. \"It's a highly effective compound move which means that it uses more than one joint and therefore multiple muscle groups. This makes it a time-efficient exercise too.\"\n\nThe press-up exercises the major muscle groups, the chest and triceps. But every muscle between the shoulders and the toes is also engaged, including the all important core muscles in the abdomen, the legs and the hips.\n\nPress-ups can really benefit women. They \"tone the pectoral muscles which lie underneath the breasts. Strong pecs provide a good strong surface for breast tissue to sit on\", says Williams. \"They also work the triceps, the muscles at the backs of the arms, which is an area a lot of women struggle with\", she adds.\n\nThe perfect push-up: mastering the basics\n\nAlthough there are many variations on the push-up, the basic principle remains the same: engage your upper back, shoulders and arms to lift your body weight off the floor, then slowly lower it back down. While that sounds simple, experts say there's plenty of room for mistakes.\n\nThere are a number of errors that people commonly make when doing a press-up, according to Richman, whose organisation runs fitness courses staffed by serving or former members of the armed forces throughout the UK. Failing to go all the way down and all the way up is one. The other common mistake Richman sees is poor body alignment. This means they \"don't get the full benefits of the exercise, and in some cases this could cause injury to the lower back\".\n\nFitness trainer, Laura Williams, admits she can't commit to five hours in the gym every week and says she doesn't see why her clients should either. So, for her, the press-up is a useful tool. She has these golden rules for her clients:\n\nMaintain a straight back - don't allow the back to arch\n\nKeep the abdominals tight throughout the move\n\nTake care of your joints - don't lock the elbows, keep the hands and fingers facing forward and position the wrists underneath the shoulders\n\nThis website uses cookies.

{"text": "Episode Prompto Impressions\n\nSo I just completed Episode Prompto. It took me just under two and a half hours, which is an hour longer than what it took me to complete Episode Gladiolus. It could have took me longer if I bothered with the side quests but I wasn't inclined; all you achieve from that is materials to upgrade your snow mobile to go faster and jump higher in a boring, mostly empty snowy area. The game play itself is \"ok\" - it is what it is; a third person shooter with a teeny weeny bit of stealth thrown in, with some terrible camera angles and aiming mechanics to add to the mix. You have a selection of six weapons: A standard handgun with infinite ammo, a melee blade, a bazooka, sniper rifle, machine gun and grenades. You can only hold one large weapon at a time but they are dotted all around the place and you can steal them from enemies when you stagger them too. The story content is much better than Gladio's which was extremely light, but at times it's like \"OK, why wasn't this mentioned at least once in the main game?\" If you want to know more about Prompto and don't mind some at times dodgy gameplay, give it a go as it actually builds upon his character nicely.\n\nPrompto was already my favorite character in the game and this just made me like him even more. It's odd that the deeper character got deeper DLC and the more one dimensional character didn't get DLC that built him up.\n\nThis episode was also very forgiving (not that Episode Gladiolus was a challenge). My playthrough was pretty sloppy and I still didn't have much trouble except for a couple of the mechs. Most of the time you don't even need to take weapons off of enemies as there are racks of them all over the place.\n\nI really loved it. I just wanted to hug Prompto all the time xD It's very interesting to learn about his backstory, he's such a sweet boy. And I'm glad he was teamed up with Aranea. She's like his cool big sister hehe!\n\nThis DLC is...a mess. Episode Prompto is a reflection of what people complained about with Resident Evil 6. Too many different ideas executed poorly instead of staying true to the series' roots.\n\nI found the gun gameplay to be fairly poor. Stealth aspects were underused and out of place. Poor snowmobile controls and movement. Feeding you lore and information in the form of collectables scattered across the episode. Aranea's presence feels entirely like fanservice and a little bit forced. Even Prompto's own personal struggle was hard to get invested in because of the lack of buildup behind it. Lastly, holding R1 for five minutes to kill a bullet sponge of a final boss is really disappointing.\n\nThere are a lot of things that Episode Gladio did right that this act gets wrong. Hopefully Episode Ignis is more like Gladio's DLC.\n\nI agree that the audio logs were a lazy decision and the final boss was a joke but even with that I still felt this DLC had more substance than Gladio's.\n\nI kind of disagree.\n\nGladio's story DLC had a self-contained plot. He's going to fight Gilgamesh to get stronger to help Noct, and he's being guided by Cor who has previously attempted the trial. It gave more background story on Cor than the game ever showed in 60+ hours, and had a clearly-told story from start to finish. Had the rest of FFXV been like Episode Gladio, it would have been a much better game.", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "9044d80c-a5d8-4c9d-b952-d35eadbb862a", "url": "http://home.eyesonff.com/showthread.php/170152-Episode-Prompto-Impressions"}

{"text": "Women's Guide To Tackle The Consequences Of Erectile Dysfunction\n\nImpotence not only affects men's sexual performance,but also has its impacts on marital relationships. Men with impotency experience anxiety, anger, depression and anguish when their sexual performance or libido reduces. This sexual concern when becomes an undertow, it causes problems in relationships and gradually the couple winds up in divorce. In no time, the sexual pleasure becomes unimportant and many couples pretend that this sexual weakness couldn't affect their bonding. However, these sexual ignorance and its very avoidance can be observed quite negative by the partner.\n\nAlthough Erectile Dysfunction (impotence) is a man's problem, but it is also a woman's despair as there is much more lost than just the noticeable. As impotence is not something that can be discussed openly in a polite conversation, understanding the condition and learning the ways to tackle with its consequences is essential, both for men and their lovemaking partner or wife.\n\nThe term erectile dysfunction refers to the inability to reach and maintain penile erection during the entire lovemaking session. Almost every man sooner or later, at least once in their life come across this sexual issue. This condition may be due to depression stress or because of undiscovered physical issues like higher cholesterol levels, heart disease, diabetes etc. Mostly, erectile dysfunction is a result of receiving illegal drugs, excessive alcohol or cigarette smoking.\n\nThus, couples should understand that Erectile Dysfunction is not a man's fault. However, there are some exceptions such as smoking and drinking which raises the chances of ED in men. Similarly, ED doesn't have to do anything with a man's lovemaking partner either.\n\nA woman, while seeing the coldness and the lack of sexual pleasure coming from their partners may think that he is ill or is cheating on her or take the blame on herself claiming she is no longer attractive for her man to get aroused. Although it is common for a woman to feel she is undesirable or unappealing when a man has trouble achieving or sustaining an erectile while making out, but impotence has nothing to do with a man's attraction for his partner. This can give rise to further troubles.\n\nEventually, the misunderstanding could make the worsen the situation escalating into actual conflict. The only way to deal with this condition is to break the silence. A little more effort can do wonders, but make sure that the tactic isn't aggravating the condition. So what should a woman do to help her man deal with impotence.\n\nFirst of all, remember it's not in you so don't feel betrayed or rejected. Recognize the problem both physically and psychologically and discuss it with your partner openly. Be patient and calm, as this is the only way to gain his trust and drooped self- confidence.\n\nTalk to an Andrologist as early as possible.

Every time I was out there the thought of closing school was in my mind. So how do we make a decision to close or modify our school day? Good Question!\n\nThe decision allows for group input but ultimately the decision is made by the President and the Principal.\n\nOur guiding principles are:\n\nStudent Safety. Can they get to school and home safely including if they have to spend some time in the inclement weather?\n\nStaff availability. Is staff able to reach the building or have they had sufficient notice to have their Finalsite loaded for an \"online\" learning day.\n\nLearning a priority. Will the disruption impact classroom or school events?\n\nFacility. Is the facility accessible and are the internal systems capable of providing the environment conducive to learning?\n\nOur process involves getting multiple sources of information about the weather (temperatures, wind, snow/tornadoes etc.) and collecting data from our suppliers-snow plowing, busing, state department of transportation and local municipalities.\n\nOur service area complicates our decision. We have students coming from St Pauls' Highland Park on the west, Hastings and River Falls on the south, Forest Lake and New Richmond on the north and Ellsworth on the East. We also monitor days of direct instruction to assure we are in compliance.\n\nWe attempt to make a decision by 7PM the evening before the event so that notices go out in a timely manner or early in the day in anticipation of what they evening might look like. We send Text and Emails through Constant Contact to those who have opted in and if school is in session make an announcement. We also notify the TV and online sites. If we make a decision to close Teachers have until early morning to get a lesson with assignments on their FinalSite page so learning continues even if school does not.\n\nAs an example on Friday morning we were informed that pelting hail or snow would be coming near the end of school so a decision was made to cancel the Play and all extracurricular activities for both Friday night and Saturday so that students could get home safely before the storm impacted them. Postponing the ACT was a major decision that weighed on us on Friday before most other schools had yet to act.\n\nBetween 4-5 am on the day of a storm we have leadership team members checking major freeways and highways and access to the school grounds if we need to make a correction we do so by 5:30am. The Principal and her staff then make decisions about the day schedule and work to find substitutes if staff cannot make it in.\n\nSeveral times this year schools looked at the same data and made different decisions. North St Paul closed, HM was 2 hours late, Mounds Park was open at the regular time, Woodbury was closed and Mahtomedi was 1 hour late. Each of us have different served populations (some have elementary schools), busing companies with depots closer to school or buses parked inside and whether or not the side streets are plowed make a huge impact.\n\nTwice this year the decision was not unanimous-including last evening. We waited until 9 pm to make a decision with weather prognosticators indicating a midnight end to snowfall in the north (it had already stopped in the south) and assurances from our removal team that the school would be ready by 8am. After personally traveling Highways 96, 61 and 694 at 4:30 am and looking at side strees in wbl, Mahtomedi and grant township others contributed similar observations from Stillwater, Lake Elmo, St Paul and Golden Valley.\n\nThe consensus was main highways were clear with pavement showing, major roads were clear but side roads in the city were a mess. Staff was available and the facility would be ready by 7. We stayed with our evening decision for a 2 hour late start as did some other schools while several closed for the day.\n\nIt's never a simple algorithm and a very easy one to criticize since there is no right answer but we do make the decision with student safety and the balanced needs of the institution in the forefront our mind.", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "4df859ae-6fa9-47af-80ad-82f687c1ecb2", "url": "https://www.hill-murray.org/quicklinks/the-presidents-blog"}

But there is nothing wrong in following our own thinking and our own way of doing things especially when it comes to designing and structuring our own created website.\n\nHaving said that, there are common basic rules that you can apply to your website.

As a result Iceland's economy not only recovered faster than any other economy in Europe, it is now growing at a faster pace than either the United States or Europe. Meanwhile in Britain David Cameron has used the occasion of the Mansion House Speech, by tradition a speech dedicated to foreign policy, to make it clear that he not only supports the banks but is wholly on their side. Warning that \"trashing\" the banks risks \"trashing\" the country, he laid out the fatcat view of the world. Essentially while the banks \"trashed\" the entire world economy because they were greedy, stupid and completely out of control, David Cameron thinks it is time for us to forgive and forget. \"Go back to sleep\" he urges us, \"the economy is safe in our hands. We've instituted new controls over the banks whereby errant bankers will be severely punished if they break the rules - that is exiled to a sunny climate with only a few million quid to live on. Other than that it's business as usual.

{"text": "Brick Veneer Orange communities decide for concrete pathways due to the material s resilience. Concrete is stronger compared to any type of various other structure product, and these cities could count on the concrete pathways to last.\n\nConcrete is used to make driveways, patios, roads, bridges, and also even whole buildings. The artificial rock called concrete is the most widely used structure product.\n\nConcrete is used as a structure for several residences thanks to its advantages. The concrete will never shed or rot, so you can constantly ensure the structure of your residence is strong and resilient. Additionally, having a concrete cellar can supply security throughout poor tornados, twisters and hurricanes.\n\nCities as well as states depend on concrete streets as transport networks. Did you recognize that even more than 60% of the United States Interstate Highway System has been developed with concrete as well as that all bridges are constructed of concrete?\n\nMaking concrete though which will considerably extend the volume generated you blend in crushed rock or sand or crushed brick. Proportions are an endless topic of discussion however the formula of 1 part concrete, 2 parts sand and also 3 components gravel by volume is a great beginning factor. Mix the dry ingredients initially then slowly include water.\n\nIn its easiest kind, Ready Mix concrete is a combination of paste and accumulations (sand & rock). The paste, composed of concrete as well as water, coats the surface area of the penalty (sand) and rugged aggregates (rocks) as well as binds them with each other into a rock-like mass referred to as concrete.\n\nThe water causes the solidifying of concrete through a procedure called hydration. Hydration is a chain reaction where the significant substances in cement type chemical bonds with water molecules and end up being hydrates or hydration items.\n\nTensile stamina of concrete is reasonably reduced, yet can be enhanced making use of metal bars or wire. Both materials give 2 sorts of toughness to the framework: steel offers tensile stamina as well as concrete compressive. This permits versatile application of enhanced concrete, such as in pieces, walls and foundations.\n\nConcrete s sturdiness, stamina and also fairly inexpensive make it the foundation of structures and infrastructure globally houses, schools and also health centers as well as flight terminals, bridges, freeways and also rail systems. The most-produced material on Earth will just be more in demand as, as an example, establishing nations end up being increasingly metropolitan, extreme weather occasions necessitate more long lasting structure materials and also the rate of various other framework materials proceeds to climb.\n\nEven building and construction specialists occasionally improperly utilize the terms cement and concrete interchangeably. Concrete is actually an ingredient of concrete. It is the fine powder that, when combined with water, sand, and also gravel or crushed stone (fine and crude accumulation), develops the rock-like mass understood as concrete.\n\nMortar is used to hold building products such as block or rock together. It is made up of a thick combination of water, sand, and cement. The water is made use of to moisten the cement as well as hold the mix together. The water to cement ratio is greater in mortar compared to in concrete in order to develop its bonding aspect.\n\nConcrete frameworks surround us anywhere we go. In truth, it is the most commonly made use of structure product due to its variety and accessibility. It is also simple to prepare in numerous shapes and kinds. The mixture includes concrete, water and also accumulations, sometimes likewise admixtures, fibers and also reinforcements. Depending upon the toughness requirements, the blend is made in various percentages. Among one of the most substantial benefits of utilizing concrete is lower expenses in comparison to making use of steel in business structures. It is fire-resistant, has sustainability possibility and can be made locally. This last attribute implies that is doesn t need to travel cross countries to be utilized on sites. With excellent benefits comes a great variety of applications.\n\nThe concrete surface area must be hard enough to prevent surface damage from positioning activities. Membrane-forming treating substances are utilized to slow down or decrease evaporation of moisture from concrete.\n\nWe make use of asphalt concrete for roadways, parking area and also flight terminals, amongst other places. It is accomplished by blending asphalt and also mineral accumulation. It is resilient, however can deteriorate with incorrect mixture, due to ecological problems, such as extremely reduced temperature levels in wintertime and rush hour loads. When designed and also preserved correctly it lasts for a very long time and also endures rush hour. Surfaces made of real Portland cement could be split in several groups based on the kind of jointing utilized to stop cracking. It is typically more durable than asphalt. On the other hand, concrete roadway could take longer to create and is connected with high initial expenses.\n\nAn additional dam worth mentioning is Grande Dixence in Switzerland, which is also the tallest dam in the country and also took 6 mln cubic metres of concrete to construct. Concrete viaducts are additionally some of the most remarkable frameworks in terms of design abilities required. Passages, bridges and also statues are some of the various other examples of concrete frameworks.\n\nWhats the Difference Between Concrete as well as Concrete? The terms concrete as well as concrete typically are utilized reciprocally, cement is actually an ingredient of concrete. Concrete is primarily a mix of aggregates and paste.

{"text": "I've arisen from my death-like Hype slumber for a few moments to say this:\n\nThe only thing that would have brought this film from the greatness of its predecessor is if Joss Whedon tried to top Marvel's The Avengers. Period. That's a recipe for disaster. History has shown that whenever a director aims to out-do his previous work instead of focusing on making his current project the best it can be, said project suffers. This happens often with sequels where the directorial team and/or story writers start to believe their own hype. That said however....\n\n...I think this film is sitting just fine in terms of critics. It's currently at 78% and while it's a distance from the 93% rating the first film received, it's hardly \"bombing\" by any stretch of the imagination. It seems that the going consensus amongst the critics is that there's too much focus on action and that the film excels at its best when the Avengers are just being themselves and NOT fighting. Perhaps Whedon and Co. thought the fans wanted more explosions and team up fights from the first film and if that's the case, moviegoers will be satiated. And it may actually top ANYTHING Transformers have done in terms of Box Office Sales.\n\nI don't think it's fair though. I'll give you TDW (that was just a low point for Marvel), but otherwise it's not really realistic to expect movies to consistently be critical hits. IM1 and TA are two of the best CBMs ever...is it really reasonable to expect their sequels to match or surpass their success? Or more importantly, is it fair to condemn a movie because it couldn't live up to the massive success of its predecessor (which also brings heightens expectations)?\n\nI don't think it's reasonable to imply that Marvel in particular doesn't make good sequels, because looking around, you'll see that it's actually very rare for an exceptional CBM to have an equally impressive sequel. X2 was followed by X3. Spider-Man 2 was followed by Spider-Man 3. The Dark Knight was followed by TDKR, which while a great critical and financial success is divisive, to say the least. Point is, it's not easy to follow up a super-success. Don't see why you're singling out the MCU for a trend that is everywhere. This goes beyond CBMs too. Look at Return of the Jedi following Empire Strikes Back, or Pirates of the Caribbean 2 following the first.\n\nI'm trying to wrap my mind around what you are saying.\n\nI'm reading that it's somehow wrong for me to exclusively talk about Marvel Studios sequels in a thread about a Marvel Studios sequel? For some reason I can't talk about one particular thing in this instance I have to discuss every sequel ever even if I don't want to and that would take away from what I am trying to discuss? So no targeted conservations for some reason.\n\nThe reason your post baffles me is because I am actually on topic while plenty of people bring up other films for no reason. You might not like what I am wondering but asking me to go off topic is more than a little ridiculous. Sorry but I'm not going to talk about every single sequel in here.\n\nIf AoU is weak sauce, I now fear for Daredevil season 2, especially with a new showrunner. Heck, I'll fear for anything not directed by the RussosI love GotG, but it wasn't a sequel. If AoU is weak, that means 4 out of 5 of their sequels have been a problem. Only the Russos pulled it off.\n\n__________________ \"I've been running scams on the street since I was ten. I was kicked out of the flight academy for having a mind of my own. I'm going be a pilot.

When the movie major turning point hinges on Bucky's fall, it doesn't really matter because we don't know him. Also, they make a deal out of Cap recruiting the Commandos, and then did nothing with them. They could have easily had the montage, but extended the sequences, while also book ending it with larger scenes. TWS handled the Cap/Bucky relationship far better imo. Showed a lot more depth in a few short mins. Which was necessary, because TFA sure didn't.\n\n__________________ \"I've been running scams on the street since I was ten.

Out of Africa came the seeds that strengthen and the seeds that weaken. Not always the leaves and fruit, but always the seeds.\n\nThese ideologies have simply been added to and varied by later generations. In other words, out of us as African Parents, our children then set up households in other lands and became other groups and have taken what we started and made it worse, made it better or left it unchanged, which is the least likely scenario.\n\nPrimitives are always at the foundation of going up for humanity and at the roof of going down for humanity.\nPrimitives are the first step in the process, the first steps of problem and the first steps of solution.\nAt any given point in time there are always simultaneous forces of strong and weak spirit dictating what takes place. One eventually prevails more than the other for a period of time.\nSpirit must move first before the physical can move. Spirit must transform itself before it can transform the physical. Primitives must transform themselves before they can change something else. Africans must transform back into our primitiveness in order to transform humanity back into the primitiveness that brought forth so much for so long, but now has gone so wrong.\nThe weak energy caught up with us and has dominated and now it is being dealt with. Soon, relatively speaking, it will be abated.\n\nSpirit is the primitive to physical matter.\nAfricans are the primitives to other groups of humans.\nThe Creator is the Primitive of Primitives.\n\nAfricans are the prime dispenser and collector of wave vibrations to and from the Above and Below – because we are the primitive connection to this dimension.\nThis is why we are the bearers of the birthright, the beginning of all that is human and the end of all that is human. This is why all groups suckle from the African Source and why the accumulation of all groups returns to Africa also. This is why as bearers of elder child responsibility, currently the rest of the family is sending back destructive energy and why the most melanated in all societies are hated. This started in Africa when Egyptians began to discriminate against their darker Ancestors from the South. The Egyptians were black but their Ancestors were blacker because they were from the Source. These are the Nubians, the Nahisi, The Aethiopians, The Negroes, The Puntites. Egyptians were all these things but had just varied enough to look a little different.\n\nIn Africa is where abuse of power began.\nIn Africa is where females were first moved from the front to the back. This took on various forms. As this ideology left Africa, it got worse and worse.\nIn Africa is where sexual deviation began in some kind of way.\nIn Africa is where family fighting began between individuals that turned into groups that turned into wide-ranging ongoing wars.\n\nIn Africa is where the enslavement of others began.\nAfricans used a so-called \"milder\" version of enslavement where the people were not dehumanized or stripped of their culture. The slaves were treated as humans and were set free at some point and their children were not slaves. When the ideology left Africa, it got worse and worse.\n\nThus everyone contributes to the progress or regress of humans.\nThese contributions, once free will is decided, are spirit guided.\n\nWe, the African Parents of the Human Family have set strong and weak examples.\nNo one is praiseless or blameless.\n\nThe primitive identity by birthright we share is the primitive responsibility by birthright we share", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "c11ab578-c6e4-4a04-acb0-8c4e7367e651", "url": "http://writerswhirlpool.blogspot.com/2016/11/africans-as-primitive-humans-downside-unity-876.html"}

The site had one tall pillar and another shorter one. The pillars were not unearthed in this shape – they had been stacked with sections from pieces of sculpted stone that had been scattered around the site. Nothing besides these two reconstructed pillars were left from what was once one of the marvels of the ancient world. This was a stark visual reminder that even the most impressive structures do not stand the test of time. Only God's kingdom will endure.\n\nDaniel 7:9-14 describes this vision of an eternal kingdom. In this passage, which comes in the form of a heavenly vision, the prophet Daniel sees a judgment scene taking place, with the Ancient of Days (God) taking his seat as the judge. God judges a number of beasts, which are symbolic for powerful earthly kingdoms that have raised themselves up against God's kingdom. One by one, these kingdoms, which seemed so permanent and dominant at the time, have their power removed from them by the One who has final and complete authority.\n\nThe scene shifts in verse 13. The Ancient of Days still presides over the proceedings, but instead of beasts, \"one like a son of man\" approaches God's throne. In other words, Daniel sees someone who looks like one of us. When the son of man comes before the Ancient of Days, he is given \"dominion and glory and a kingdom.\" The passage says that all people and nations will recognize his authority, and his reign will be permanent. This is the one kingdom that will stand the test of time!\n\nWe learn several things about God's kingdom from this passage. First, God's kingdom has been opposed throughout the history of the world. But no kingdom ever prevails against God's kingdom. Additionally, although God in some sense has always and will always rule over this world, he has designated a special representative, the son of man, to implement this kingdom directly on the earth.\n\nIn Mark 1:14-15 Jesus describes this kingdom as \"good news\" or \"gospel\" (these are the same word in the Greek language). This emphasizes again the idea that God's good and perfect reign is cause for hope and celebration. When Jesus says that \"the time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand (or near),\" he means that according to God's timetable the promised kingdom of God is ready to be unveiled. The kingdom was drawing near with the arrival of the King – the Son of Man – Jesus. In fact, in all four Gospels, \"Son of Man\" is Jesus' preferred title for himself. Jesus understood that his ultimate calling was to rule over the world as God's Anointed One.\n\nJesus makes it clear that the arrival of the kingdom rests in God's hands alone. Jesus doesn't tell his listeners to build the kingdom. Instead, he simply announces the coming of the kingdom. What did Jesus tell the people to do in response? He told them to \"repent and believe in the gospel\" (the good news he had just spoken about). God is bringing his kingdom to the world, but people cannot enter in their current state of resistance to God. They must humbly repent and believe.\n\nThe proclamation of the arrival of God's long-awaited kingdom was and is good news for a world that needs God's leadership and authority. In response, we must get on board with God's kingdom agenda by repenting from our sin and our own agendas. We must humbly believe in God, his kingdom, and his king – Jesus", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "40d2b5bd-1730-4458-a1bc-7692d74b11c3", "url": "https://gregorysmagee.wordpress.com/tag/book-of-daniel/"}
{"text": "Saturday, October 8, 2016\n\nAmerican Empire: Liberty, Equality, and Justice for All\n\nAmerican Empire Liberty, Equality, and Justice for All\n\nSimon Seamount\n\nI do not view American civilization as an isolated or new process, rather I see it as the continuation of dynamic socio-political forces that began in Greece around 2,600 years ago, with the golden age of the development of Greek philosophy, although even those forces are the later segment of the river of civilization that sprang forth over 10,000 years ago.\n\nThe most prominent character in the history of the development of our society is Jesus, whom I see not as a supernatural god who rose from the dead, but as a man descended from the ancient kings of Israel who attempted to take the throne of his ancestors but failed and ended up designing the church as a new way for a king to be a self-less leader of his people, ruling in their minds no matter where they live rather than ruling over land where some people happen to live.\n\nIn my view Jesus the Fisher King was married to Mary Magdalene the Mermaid and their descendants through Meroveus, Arthur, Constantine, Charlemagne, William the Conqueror, and Edward Longshanks have ruled over all the kings of Europe the past thousand years. They are the founders of the bloodline of the Holy Grail, where this term originates as the phrase San Graal which was mistaken for, or purposely coded to hide the original phrase Sang Raal, meaning Royal Blood, shortened from the phrase Sang Israel. The family of the Holy Grail are the descendants of Jesus and Mary Magdalene which includes just about everybody of western Europe descent.\n\nJesus was god to all the kings ruling Europe the past thousand years because he was their ancestor, while the whole aspect of his rising from the dead and reigning among the crystal shells of Aristotle was a theological argument based on the eternal forms and Ideas of Plato.\n\nChristianity is the political party of the descendants of Jesus with the basic ruling principle that only the bloodline descendants of Jesus have the right to rule over the kingdoms of the world, and their continual and continuing goal has been and is the complete domination of the world. After his descendants had ruled Europe for over a thousand years, the recent two world wars were the almost complete destruction and overthrow of the ancient dynasties of Jesus and his sons.\n\nAll the presidents of the United States are descendants of Jesus through William the Conqueror and his descendant Henry II, and in every election the person with more Plantagenet genes always wins. Even the candidates in the current game of thrones election cycle are both descendants of James II of Scotland, descended from John of Gaunt, son of Edward III.\n\nPolitical forces in America continue from the political forces in England. All the presidents spring from the York and Lancaster families who contended for power over England in the War of the Roses, which was won and resolved through Henry VIII, and then England began its rise to become a global empire with the reign of Elizabeth I, the Fairy Queen of Avalon, which ended with World War II and the reign of Elizabeth II.\n\nIn the current election cycle in America, though both are Plantagenets of the Holy Grail, we have an arrogant, misogynist rapist who cheats small business owners by not paying them for work they perform and cares only for his own gain, a reflection of Henry VIII the Beheader, versus a humble, compassionate, multiculturalist who genuinely cares for everyone, a reflection of Elizabeth I the Guardian of Virtue.\n\nThe political system in America is a near exact replica of the power system that developed in Europe at the core of Christendom over a thousand years where the papacy, as a continuation of the ancient fisherman priests and the emperors of Rome, is mirrored by the federal government of Washing with the President as the Pope of the American religion of Liberty and Justice for all, whereas the contentious kings who ruled kingdoms across Europe are mirrored by the individual states asserting their sovereign rights against the encompassing and unifying power of the papacy and the federal government.\n\nThe socio-political forces of the American civilization are a continuation of the socio-political forces of Christendom, and we remain the \"shining city on a hill\" envisioned by John Winthrop on the ship Arabella as he lead Puritans to found Massachusetts in 1630. My ancestors Thomas Dudley, Simon Bradstreet, and Poet Anne Bradstreet were on that ship, believers in that vision which has been guiding the rise of America the past four centuries.\n\nAs I look back on almost 400 years of the growth of America from a \"shining city on a hill\" to a global empire, I wonder how we will transform beyond these old paradigms to change into a society that treats every person with equal justice and provides equal opportunities to education and employment so we build a system that reflects our core principles of Liberty, Equality, and Justice for all.", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "8ce77639-32c6-4e41-b81d-012f01a900df", "url": "http://surazeus.blogspot.com/2016/10/american-empire-liberty-equality-and.html"}
{"text": "Best Practices for Transforming Legacy IT to the Cloud\n\nThe Importance of Orchestration in Cloud Computing\n\nThe orchestration of workflow processes is an essential part of cloud computing. Without orchestration, many of the benefits and characteristics of cloud computing cannot be achieved at the price point that cloud services should be offered. Failure to automate as many processes as possible results in higher personnel labor costs, slower time to deliver the new service to customers, and ultimately higher cost with less reliability.\n\nWhat is meant by automation? Automation is technique used in traditional data centers–and critical in a cloud environment–to install software or initiate other activities. Traditional IT administrators use sequential scripts to perform a series of tasks (e.g. software installation or configuration); however, this is now considered an antiquated technique in a modern cloud-based environment. Orchestration differs from automation in that it does not rely entirely on static sequential scripts but rather sophisticated workflows; multiple automated threads; query-based and if/then logic; object-oriented and topology workflows; and even the ability to back-out a series of automated commands if necessary.\n\nOrchestration can best be explained through a typical use case example of a customer placing an order within their cloud service web-portal, and following the steps necessary to bring the service online. The actions below illustrate a very high level scenario where the cloud management software performs the orchestration:\n\nCustomer logs into web-based cloud portal, views a catalog of available services.\n\nCustomer selects a cloud service such as a medium-sized virtual machine running the Linux operating system. The service catalog shows this size of VM comes with 2 CPUs, 4GB of memory and 50GB of disk storage at a price of $250 per month. Customer choses quantity 2 of this VM, and goes to the checkout section of web site.\n\nCustomer pays for services using a credit card or an existing financial account/credit on file already with the cloud provider. Customer completes the checkout.\n\nCustomer may have an approval process in place (especially for a private cloud deployment) that requires their financial/procurement team to bless the order before it is finalized. So the cloud management system sends an email to the designated approver of this order. The customer approver receives the email, clicks on the URL link, logs into the cloud portal, and approves the order for $250 per month with quantity 2, or $500 per month in total.\n\nThe cloud management system sees the order was approved and immediately begins the process of building the requested virtual machines. The system knows which server farms and pools of available resources it has, and automatically selects which physical server node will host the VMs initially. Storage is allocated/assigned to the VM and a template used for the VM.\n\nThe VMs are booted for the first time and any needed patches or updates automatically installed. The cloud management system detects that the VM has launched and is ready for the customer. It charges the customer's credit card or deducts funds from the customer's online account with the provider.\n\nThe cloud management system send a welcome email to the customer indicating the network address and login instructions for how to use their new VMs, along with information on where to obtain documentation and whom to call for support.\n\nCustomer logs into the VMs and performs any further application installations, configurations, and loading of production data. The cloud provider manages all future system updates and ensure systems are operational at all times. Customer manages their own applications and custom configurations themselves.\n\nCloud management system automatically renews and re-bills customer every month (or whatever the billing cycle length is). Depending on the type of service offered, there may also be variable expenses, such as if the customer wanted the VMs to automatically increase memory, CPU, or storage upon increased load. The cloud management system will provide the metered resource information to the customer, and charge them accordingly.\n\nAs you can see in the above case scenario, a human being does not need to be involved within the cloud service provisioning anywhere in this process. In a real public cloud scenario, this process is repeated at all hours, thousands of times per day. This is where the cloud provider gains such scales of economy that the customer is paying less for their cloud service then they would had they built and hosted the service themselves. Without automated processes and cloud management systems, none of these economies of scale are possible and the cloud provider's costs will be anti-competitive is using legacy labor-intensive manual service provisioning. There are some smaller cloud providers today that still manually configure IT systems–behind the scenes with little or no automation–this business model is usually not profitable for the provider causing less accuracy, consistency, slower provisioning, higher-cost, and ultimately a poor customer experience.\n\nNIST Model for Cloud Orchestration\n\nWhat to ask your potential cloud provider:\n\nWhen evaluating your cloud provider choices, ask for detailed workflow diagrams or processes that the cloud provider uses for orchestration. The cloud provider should be able to provide you a live demonstration of their cloud management platform, ordering process, and show the orchestration workflows.\n\nIf you are building your own private or enterprise cloud, you should carefully evaluate and deploy your own cloud management platform with a robust orchestration capability. This orchestration system will also allow you to bridge your traditional IT and cloud systems–allowing you to leverage existing scripts and automation tools (e.g. Puppet, Chef, static sequential scripts and batch routines) while transitioning long-term to more sophisticated orchestration workflows.\n\n5 replies\n\nIt would be great to see a follow on post with view extend flow in scenario where more than resource was provisioned. e.g. fully configured dev or test environment – requires installing apps/tools/monitoring components, additional steps of service validation etc\n\nThank you for the comment. Regarding figure 1.5, I originally included \"managed\" IaaS services, offered by some providers, in the roles shown. You are correct that most generic–and certainly public cloud–service providers do not offer managed IaaS services to include the operating system. I will make a correction in the book to reflect the fact, as you pointed out, that most IaaS providers do not manage the operating system as a base offering. I have also updated the blog post on this site to reflect the latest diagram that you can download if you like (\n\nJames Bond, no kidding, love it. Great blog, thank you. None of existing automation tools are ready for prime time. Think, over 3000 apps and daily maintenance. And there are no infinite resources to Chef all day long, it's not easy. And if I am a small enterprise, I have no skill to provision apps and services. What is the latest in this area? And I don't want to pay a fortune to managed providers either.", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "e9c99e0c-6a13-4731-8762-f2255d3fa1ad", "url": "https://mycloudblog7.wordpress.com/2015/06/12/11/comment-page-1/"}

Instead, we focus on the value added by community-driven content through members' discussions, reviews, and ratings of content items. To gain critical mass for community input, we must actively lower barriers to participation by disseminating information from both the content and the community into the notification streams that community members routinely use. This includes traditional dissemination mechanisms (web-sites for collections, forums, email, and online blogs and newsletters for notification) and newer notification streams (social networking sites where users can subscribe to receive notification as part of their everyday online life).\n\nOur target educational community is the AlgoViz project ( which aims to promote the use of Algorithm Visualizations (AVs) in the classroom. Despite being widely viewed as potentially improving CS education, the rate of AV use has progressed little from the mid 1990s. Known impediments could be overcome if existing knowledge about best practices in AV use were distributed by an effective community of AV developers and users. Improved AV use in the classroom potentially affects the educational outcomes for tens of thousands of students every year. A clearinghouse of available AVs, with community-based rating and review, and interaction between users and developers, will make it easier for instructors to adopt quality educational materials.

Wood, though, is enjoying a bit of renewed interest thanks to a research team who have found a way to make wood that's so strong it can stop bullets.\n\nThis new super wood is being called, originally enough, \"super wood.\" We'll cut the scientists who created it some slack, though. They created wood that's as strong as titanium; so what if they missed a golden opportunity to name it.\n\nThe team from the University of Maryland are taking a natural material and making it ten times tougher. Their chemical treatments may soon take soft woods, like pine, and make these fast-growing trees much more useful.\n\n\"This new way to treat wood makes it twelve times stronger than natural wood and ten times tougher,\" says Liangbing Hu, head of the research team said in a press release. \"This could be a competitor to steel or even titanium alloys, it is so strong and durable. It's also comparable to carbon fiber, but much less expensive.\"\n\nPopular Mechanics explains the science behind the concept. \"One of the things that makes wood wood is a polymer known as lignin which forms support structures in trees and plants. The second most abundant naturally-occurring polymer on Earth, lignin is what makes wood rigid and brown. Somewhat counterintuitively, Hu and his team removed the wood's lignin polymers in order to make their wood even stronger.\"\n\nWith the lignin removed, the team simply compressed what was left.

{"text": "Key\n\nThis line was added.\n\nThis line was removed.\n\nFormatting was changed.\n\nComment:\nMigrated to Confluence 5.3\n\nBackground\n\nPrior to OpenMRS version 1.8, the search widgets were written with dojo which involved writing a separate javascript file where you would have to extended the parent OpenmrsSearch for each Openmrs Object if it were to be searchable in the webapp. The widgets would fetch all hits in one ajax query which would take a while to return all the hits in case there are many making the widgets slow. In 1.8, this was changed by introducing a single and more generic search widget written with jquery, the widget is faster from a user's stand point in that it fetches just the exact number of results to display on the first page and then continue to query the server for the rest in the background while updating the table until all results are returned. The reason behind this is that it should take way less time to display the first N results to display on the first page rather waiting for all the matching hits to be returned in one call in case there are many. The objective is to increase the perceived speed from a user's point of view since they get back results for the first page in a nick of time even if it isn't all.\n\nHow to include a search widget for a domain object in a jsp\n\nThis can be relatively simple if the domain objects to search already have the required methods in the API. Currently the required methods have been added for Concepts, Encounters, Patients, Users, Locations, Providers, Drugs and ConceptReferenceTerms. Let's assume you wish to add an encounter search widget to your jsp, add the snippet below to your jsp (you can leave out the javascript and css files that you already have in the parent jsp).\n\nThe first four html includes are required because they contain the necessary scripts used by the widgets and the css file for improved styling via datatables' support for jquery-ui themes so that the widgets match the active theme on the page.\n\nYou call to the server needs to return a map of the results with the following key names:\n\ncount: Maps to the count of the total expected number of hits, this is only required for the first call, therefore in your code on the server, it is recommended to check when the start index is 0, you include the count\n\nobjectList: Maps to the actual list of hits\n\nnotification: Maps to an informative or error message you wish to display for the user about the results in the UI\n\nsearchAgain: Maps to the phrase against which to search again, when this key is included with a value, the search widget machinery will discard the current results and re run the search against the new specified phrase, a use case for this is if there are no matches to what the user originally entered and you wish to send them back results based on a shorter phrase\n\nNext thing is to initialize the widget and there are 2 ways to do it, the one used above is the one which delegates to a helper function that takes in 6 arguments, the arguments are;\n\nelementId: the id of the element that will be the container of the widget\n\nThe arguments passed to the widgets are to used to customize the widget properties, in the example above, 'searchLabel' specifies the label that appears to the left of the search input box, 'searchPlaceHolder' specifies the text to display inside the input box as a place holder, 'searchHandler' specifies the javascript function to be called to fetch the hits from the server, and 'fieldsAndHeaders' specifies the properties of the returned objects to display in the table of results along with their respective column headers, see below for the full list of the widget properties. 'SelectionHandler' specifies the function to be called when the user selects a row in the table, in our example above, we open the encounter form and the encounter to edit becomes the selected one.\n\n'SearchHandler' specifies the function that will get called by the script to fetch results from the server, the function gets called at least once once the search is triggered. The first call is expected to return a map with 2 key-value pairs i.e the expected total count of results and results to display on the first page. Typically, you should have logic on the server that get called by this function via ajax and it is important to make sure it returns the expected map. The keys in the returned map are 'count' and 'objectList' and their values should be the total count of expected results and the results to display on the first page respectively. Any subsequent calls to the search handler after the first call don't require that the count gets returned.\n\nIn this example, we call the DWREncounterService.findCountAndEncounters(String, boolean, Integer, Integer, boolean) method and below is how the code could like like:\n\nCode Block\n\npublic Map<String, Object> findCountAndEncounters(String phrase, boolean includeVoided, Integer start, Integer length,\nboolean getMatchCount) throws APIException {\n//Map to return\nMap<String, Object> resultsMap = new HashMap<String, Object>();\nVector<Object> objectList = new Vector<Object>();\ntry {\nEncounterService es = Context.getEncounterService();\nint encounterCount = 0;\nif (getMatchCount)\nencounterCount += es.getCountOfEncounters(phrase, includeVoided);\n//If we have any matches, fetch them or if this is not the first ajax call\n//for displaying the results on the first page, the getMatchCount is expected to be zero\nif (encounterCount > 0 || !getMatchCount)\nobjectList = findBatchOfEncounters(phrase, includeVoided, start, length);\nresultsMap.put(\"count\", encounterCount);\nresultsMap.put(\"objectList\", objectList);\n}\ncatch (Exception e) {\nobjectList.clear();\nobjectList.add(\"Error while searching for encounters\");\nresultsMap.put(\"count\", 0);\nresultsMap.put(\"objectList\", objectList);\n//you can opt to pass in a new phrase which will tell the core search widget to rerun the\n//search but for your new phrase and this will lead to ignoring the results you send back\nresultsMap.put(\"searchAgain\", \"newphrase\");\n}\nreturn resultsMap;\n}\n\nThe implementation of the server side logic should call the API methods that return the count and the appropriate search method that supports paging for the given domain object, in this case they would be EncounterService.getCountOfEncounters(String, boolean) and EncounterService.getEncounters(String, Integer, Integer, boolean). In the DAO layer, it's highly recommended that these methods use the same criteria object and the difference should be that the one that gets the count by setting a row count projection while the other should return the actual objects matching the criteria. This implies that the total number of hits fetched when the search is done should always match the value returned by the get Count method otherwise the scripts in the widgets will fail with the assumption that there is either more hits to fetch. For an example implementation of the methods in the DAO layer, you can look at HibernateEncounterDAO.getCountOfEncounters(String, boolean) and HibernateEncounterDAO.getEncounters(String, Integer, Integer, boolean).\n\nIf you don't wish to support paging in your widgets and want to have all results returned in one request just set the value of the length argument to null when calling your server side code in the search handler.\n\nWidget properties\n\nminLength: int (default: 1) The minimum number of characters required to trigger a search, this is ignored if 'doSearchWhenEmpty' is set to true\n\nsearchLabel: string (default: omsgs.searchLabel) The text to be used as the label for the search textbox\n\nincludeVoidedLabel: string (default: omsgs.includeVoided) The text to be used as the label for the 'includeVoided' checkbox\n\nsearchHandler: function(text, resultHandler, options) (default:null) The function to be called to fetch search results from the server\n\nresultsHandler: function(results) (default:null) The function to be called\n\nselectionHandler: function(index, rowData)\n\nfieldsAndHeaders: Array of fieldNames and column header maps\n\ndisplayLength: int (default: 10)\n\ncolumnWidths: an array of column widths, the length of the array should be equal to the number of columns, should be of the same length as the number of columns\n\ncolumnRenderers: array of fnRender(s) for each column, should be of the same length as the number of columns, set a value of null for columns with no renderers\n\ncolumnVisibility: array of bVisible values for each column, true/false are the only possible values in the array and should be of the same length as the number of columns\n\ninitialData: (default: null) The initial data to be displayed e.g if it is an encounter search, it should be an encounter list\n\nsearchPhrase: string The phrase to be set in the search box so that a search is triggered on page load to display initial items\n\ndoSearchWhenEmpty: string (default:false): If it is set to true, it lists all items initially and filters them with the given search phrase.\n\nverboseHandler: function to be called to return the text to display as verbose output\n\nattributes: Array of name and column headers for attributes columns to display in the list of results. For this to work, the returned items should have an 'attributes' property which should be a map of attribute names and their values.

{"text": "How to Motivate Yourself to Work Out RegularlyMake a schedule\n\nInstead of treating exercising as something you should do, treat it something you have to do. In other words, it should become a part of your daily routine. First, decide on how often you want to work out. Then, schedule your workouts in your daily planner or calendar just like you would schedule any other appointment. This might seem unnecessary, but once you move your workouts from the optional category to the obligatory one, you'll have a much easier time staying motivated.\n\nSet a goal\n\nIf you're working out on your own, it's easy to get bored and demotivated. This is why you should set some goals for yourself. The goals could be anything, just try to make them short-term. This way, you will be able to track your own progress much more easily. You'd also have a clear reason for working out, instead of just doing it because you know you should.\n\nReward yourself\n\nAfter completing the above-mentioned goals, reward yourself. Go see a movie with your friends, buy yourself a new pair of jeans, or spend a day in a spa center. Just don't reward yourself by eating a whole pizza on your own or eating a candy bar every time you go to the gym. This way, by knowing there's a reward waiting for you at the end of the day or week, you'll feel much more motivated to stay on the right path.\n\nJoin a class\n\nBeing in a group of people who are just like you might be just the kind of motivation you need. You won't feel alone on your path to success, and you might even make some great friends. You might also find your competitive spirit, and needless to say, everything is more fun when you're not doing it alone. If you don't like the idea of joining a class, find a friend who is into exercising and has similar fitness goals to yours. You'd be getting in shape while strengthening your friendship at the same time.\n\nGet a personal trainer\n\nThis is probably one of the best ways to stick to your schedule. Deciding to train with a personal fitness trainer is a serious commitment, which means that you'll be less likely to back out of it. Moreover, your trainer is a professional after all, which means that they will know what you need and how to make the whole exercising routine much more effective and fun for you.\n\nMake a playlist\n\nYou know how music always makes you want to dance and just makes you feel more energized in general? Use that power of music to your advantage, and create your own workout playlist. Include fast songs that make you want to move around, and you might even find yourself looking forward to exercising just so you could enjoy the feeling of moving to the music.\n\nSurround yourself with motivation\n\nWhat is it that motivates you to work out? Do you want to lose weight, gain muscles, get a six pack? Do you want to look like your favorite actor or actress? Or do you simply want to improve your lifestyle? Whatever it is, surround yourself with it – hang posters on the walls, use motivational wallpapers as your phone background image, watch movies that emphasize good physique, etc. Sometimes, all it takes to feel motivated is one glance at your final goal.\n\nAt the end of the day, the best way to motivate yourself to exercise is to find the type of exercise that is both effective and enjoyable for you. If you choose something that you don't even like, it will always feel more like a chore than a hobby. So, try to spice up your workout routine with some of the above-mentioned suggestions, and have no doubt that the results will show in no time.", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "430c99b8-1ab8-4543-a90f-28102d2101d3", "url": "https://www.irishhealthhour.com/blog/2018/6/1/how-to-motivate-yourself-to-work-out-regularly"}
{"text": "The Shambles\n\nThe Shambles (officially known as just Shambles[1]) is an old street in York, England, with overhanging timber-framed buildings, some dating back as far as the fourteenth century. It was once known as The Great Flesh Shambles, probably from the Anglo-SaxonFleshammels (literally 'flesh-shelves'), the word for the shelves that butchers used to display their meat. As recently as 1872 twenty-five butchers' shops were located along the street, but now none remain.\n\nIntersection of Shambles and Little Shambles streets, York\n\nThe street was mentioned in the Doomsday Book of 1086. Many of the current buildings are from circa 1350-1475.[2] Among the structures of the Shambles is a shrine to Saint Margaret Clitherow, who was married to a butcher who owned and lived in a shop there at No. 10 Shambles. Her home is now a cufflinks shop, Cuffs & Co, and features the priest hole fireplace that ultimately led to her death.\n\nAlthough the butchers have now vanished, a number of the shops on the street still have meat-hooks hanging outside and, below them, shelves on which meat would have been displayed. The shops currently include a mixture of eateries and souvenir sellers, but there is also a bookshop and a bakery. Five snickelways lead off the Shambles. A daily market (Shambles Market) operates in the area.[3]\n\nThe Shambles Market on Silver St., York, very close to The Shambles, operates daily\n\nContents\n\n\"Shambles\" is an obsolete term for an open-air slaughterhouse and meatmarket. Streets of that name were so called from having been the sites on which butchers killed and dressed animals for consumption. (One source suggests that the term derives from \"Shammel\", an Anglo-Saxon word for shelves that stores used to display their wares while another indicates that by AD 971 \"shamble\" meant a 'bench for the sale of goods' and by 1305, a 'stall for the sale of meat'. )[4][5]\n\nThe Shambles in Stroud still has the hinged wooden boards attached to the shops, and hosts a regular local market.\n\nThe Shambles in Shepton Mallet, Somerset is a much shorter replica of the fourteenth century shambles that housed the regular Monday market since 1318. The market however was moved to Friday in 1641 and is still held around the local shambles monument.\n\nDuring that period there were no sanitary facilities or hygiene laws as exist today, and guts, offal, and blood were thrown into a runnel down the middle of the street or open space where the butchering was carried out.", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "da2db502-22e6-4f2a-978a-65138a09175f", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Shambles"}

When driven into the highly non-linear wave breaking regime the plasma wave mutates to a solitary bubble that generates ultra-short dense bunches of electrons with quasi-monoenergetic energy spectra. The electron bunches may have density high enough to forward-scatter the tail of the laser pulse. The forward scattering results in blue shift of the laser pulse after interaction. The energetic electrons make betatron oscillations in transverse fields of the plasma wave and emit hard X- and γ-rays. We show that an extremely bright source of GeV γ-quanta can be built due to the combination of an external electron beam and the laser wake field.

In the first case it doesn't correlate with other events (beyond some time scale). In the latter case the correlation time scale exceeds the life time of the universe. The estimated minimum size of such a molecule is about 250 independent blocks. The probability of a random self-assembly of 250 constituent blocks in a particular order is 1/250! which is about 10^-500. This probability is prohibitingly small.

Excelling in everything he did he represented the Royal Air Force in aerobatics displays, played rugby for Harlequins, and was tipped to be the next England fly half. But one afternoon in December all his ambitions came to an abrupt end when he crashed his plane doing a particularly difficult and illegal aerobatic trick. His injuries were so bad that surgeons were forced to amputate both his legs to save his life. Douglas Bader did not fly again until the outbreak of the Second World War, when his undoubted skill in the air was enough to convince a desperate air force to give him his own squadron. The rest of his story is the stuff of legend. Flying Hurricanes in the Battle of Britain he led his squadron to kill after kill, keeping them all going with his unstoppable banter. Shot down in occupied France, his German captors had to confiscate his tin legs in order to stop him trying to escape. Bader faced it all, disability, leadership and capture, with the same charm, charisma and determination that was an inspiration to all around him.\n\nAbout the Author:\nDuring the war Paul Brickhill was shot down over German territory and sent to a prisoner of war camp. After the war he wrote about the numerous escape attempts in which he was involved in THE GREAT ESCAPE.

{"text": "Today, mobile phones are one of the first instruments every individual person interacts with. There are lots of mobile applications used by people to achieve their goals. One of the most-used applications is mobile banks. Security in m-bank applications is very important, therefore modern methods of authentication is required. Most of m-bank applications use text passwords which can be stolen by key-loggers. Key-loggers are hidden software to record the keys struck by users. To overcome the key-logging issue, One-Time Passwords are used. They are secure but require additional tools to be used, therefore they cannot be user-friend. Moreover, the voice-based passwords are not secure enough, since they can be heard by other people easily. In other hand, Image-based passwords cannot satisfy users, cause of screen limitation in mobile phones. In this article, a new authentication method is introduced. The password is based on user lip's motion which is received via a mobile cellphone camera. The visual information extracted from the user's lips movement forms the password. Then the lip motion is tracked to recognize the password by incorporating the lip reading algorithms. The algorithm is based on the Viola-Jones method. It combines the method with a pixel-based approach to segment lips and extract features. After segmenting the lips, some special points of Region of Interests are selected. The information extracted from lips are saved in order to act as algorithm's features. In addition, some normalizing methods are considered to normalize the features and prepare them to enter classification phase. In classification step, some known algorithms like Support Vector Machine and K-Nearest Neighbor are applied on features to recognize password and authenticate people. Visual passwords prevent key-loggers from stealing passwords. However, the mobility of a mobile user causes ambient lights to vary in different environments. In this research, a solution is designed to tackle this challenge. Finally a mobile banking application is designed and developed to run on android mobile phones platform. It incorporates a lip reader which recognizes the passwords in offline mode. The application is independent from the internet connection or a dedicated server. The implemented recognition method has achieved a 70% success rate. In this application a video capture of a letter with 10 frames could be processed in 3.8 seconds using 628 kilo bytes of memory.

Try the #1 casual dating app to see why.\n\nWhat is casual dating anyways? I define it as the purgatory between friends with benefits and a committed relationship. It's more than friends with benefits because it's more than just having sex. It's less than a relationship because there is no commitment or conversations about your future together. Casual dating is supposed to be fun, light, and usually temporary.\n\nIt's just a personal decision and preference. You think to yourself, \"Oh hell no is that the hooker Jamie from Delta Gamma?! To start a friendship:\n\nI'm not saying that it can't develop into something serious, but it typically doesn't. No, and that's what makes it so damn complicated. There are so many gray areas, the only thing you know for sure is what their name and number is. I hope to clear up some of confusion for once and for all.\n\nBe on the same page.

If one of you is hoping your dating situation turns into a relationship, and the other is just interested in having fun, there's now different expectations. This sort of difference in expectations is what causes things to get very messy, very fast.\n\nImagine Greg waking up to 17 missed calls from that girl named Vanessa he took out to dinner twice; all because she saw him talking to another girl at a bar. Or imagine you're Vanessa, who thinks she just saw her new boyfriend Greg macking on another girl.\n\nYeah, I'd hate to be them too. Establish you are on the same page from the get-go. If you're not, end it then and there.\n\nIs it okay to see other people? What about sleep with other people? This goes hand in hand with being on the same page, and it What Is The Meaning Of Absolute Hookup case by case.

It's just a personal decision and preference. But what if John and Becca haven't established if it's okay or not okay to see other people, then Becca gets asked out on a date? Or John sleeps with a random girl he met in a bar? In Becca's case, she shouldn't say no on account of John.\n\nIf Becca wants to say no, it should be for her own reasons. In both cases, they need to let each other know so that they remain on the same page and maintain respect and courtesy. I'm not saying they should come out and tell each other every detail. It could be brought up by saying: Using protection should always be a given if you're not in a monogamous relationship. As stated above, both of you are more than likely going to be sleeping with more than one person.\n\nWhen is it okay to text or call them? Save the texting and calling for when you want to set up a date or a meetup, and get straight to the point. There's a new Sushi place downtown I want to try.

Don't talk about the future. Because casual dating is usually short term, it's weird if you bring up doing something together on Halloween when it's May 4th. Making plans more than five months in advance is anything but casual. It will probably put pressure on the other person and make them feel trapped. Take your dates and time spent together day by day.\n\nIn Becca's case, she shouldn't say no on account of John. I am 37, a single mom and am looking to find someonebut not a boyfriend. More times than not, they're way better looking in person. Not a completely unforgivable cunt?\n\nDon't look too far into the future. Even if you can see yourself barbecuing baby back ribs on the Fourth Of July together, refrain from telling them that until it's July 3rd Okay, maybe a little before July 3rd. Overthinking things is one of the hardest parts of casual dating, especially for women. But honestly, cut it out. Ending your overthinking habits begins with changing your mindset.

{"text": "DNA 'fingerprint' brings prospect of fast test for cancer\n\nResearchers have always been looking for a commonality among cancers to develop a diagnostic tool that could apply across all types.\n\nCurrent detection of cancer requires a tissue biopsy - a surgical procedure to collect tissue from the patient's tumour.\n\nIf the water stays pink this would suggest you have cancer, although the test can not detect what type or how advanced the disease is.\n\n\"So we were very excited about an easy way of catching these circulating free cancer DNA signatures in blood\", he said.\n\nNow researchers have discovered that patterns of molecules attached to DNA, which control which genes are switched on and off, look different on cancer cells.\n\nA normal cell DNA's distinct methyl pattern is crucial to regulating its machinery and maintaining its functions.\n\n\"Virtually every piece of cancerous DNA we examined had this highly predictable pattern\", he explained. These were different to what we saw with normal tissue DNA in the water. Though made of gold, the particles turn the water pink. This is because gold can affect molecular behaviour in a way that causes visible colour changes.\n\nThose specific structures can then be separated from the solution by sticking them to bare metal surfaces such as gold, the researchers found. \"This could be done in conjunction with other tests and the combined information may give us a lot of ideas of where the cancer is and the stage\".\n\nThe test also works for electrochemical detection - when the DNA is attached onto flat gold electrodes.\n\n\"This led to the creation of low-priced and portable detection devices that could eventually be used as a diagnostic tool, possibly with a mobile phone\".\n\nFor this test to work properly the DNA must be pure. These signatures are gold-hungry, which makes them possible to identify with a simple color-change test. Trials are still in the initial stages and it has only been tested on breast, bowel, prostate, and lymphoma cancers but the researchers say it could have the ability to spot any type of cancer with up to 90 percent accuracy.\n\nAnd though this \"methylscape\" could serve as a biomarker for cancer, researchers didn't have a good way to detect it.\n\nIt is based on a process known as epigenetics - the attachment of a chemical tag known as a methyl group to DNA.\n\nIt is a promising start, though further analysis with more samples is needed to prove its clinical use.\n\nAlthough it is far too early to know how useful the discovery could be as a clinical tool, scientists said it was an exciting advance in the understanding of cancer.\n\nWe are also considering whether the test could help monitor treatment responses based on the abundance of DNA signatures in body fluid during treatment.", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "371052f7-cf9b-4a60-ba2f-d7272018867e", "url": "http://thelakeandeswave.com/2018/12/06/dna-fingerprint-brings-prospect-of-fast-test-for-cancer.html"}
{"text": "Reunited\n\nI think that over the years, we have all become used to men going off to war, and leaving their families safely at home, while they fight for the freedom and safety of people all over the world who are unknown to them. It's a common part of war, and one that most of the time, the average person doesn't even think about. It's war after all, sacrifices have to be made. What we don't always think about…until someone points out the obvious to us…is the families, and especially the children who are waiting for their parent to come home.\n\nFor any of us who have been away from family for an extended period of time, it's easy to understand just how badly you can miss someone you love, but war is different. When your child moves away, you miss them, but you know you can go see them soon. When you loved one goes off to war in a country where the fighting is heavy, and bombs are dropping everywhere…not only can you not go visit them whenever you want to, but you live with the knowledge that at any moment, they could be killed in action. And they are living with that knowledge too. It makes the time and distance seem much longer and much further than it really is.\n\nWhile we might be able to fathom the pain of missing a family member, I think we find it even harder to grasp the complete and utter shocked sense of relief that these family members feel when they are reunited with their loved one again. The children are especially heart wrenching…or is it heart warming. It doesn't really matter which it is, because no one watching it does so without tears. It's just impossible. When a German World War II prisoner, was released by the Soviet Union, and is reunited with his daughter, she cannot control her emotions. She had not seen her father since she was one year old, and she is about 5 years old. A mom who spent 7 months in Iraq, cannot contain herself when she sees her daughter again. An officer's son breaks down because he wasn't sure he would ever see his daddy again. These are the moments most of us never got to see, but now with the internet,we have the chance to look into the lives of those who serve our nation, fight our battles, and protect our world. It is in those moments that we realize what really happens when those who serve are reunited with their loved ones again.", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "db201660-1d86-4b4f-854a-836a793651df", "url": "http://carynschulenberg.com/2018/09/reunited/"}

{"text": "They believe that the Church's primary mission is to solve humankind's ills. So, when it does not address and resolve hunger, disease, war, and other earthly problems, they label Christianity as \"irrelevant.\"\n\nSin is the root of life's problems. Evil forces—including our flesh—continually foster sin. James writes, \"What causes fights and quarrels among you? Don't they come from your desires that battle within you?\" (James 4:1). Moses directly states that the \"inclination of the thoughts of the human heart [is] only evil all the time\" (Genesis 6:5). We are naturally selfish. Our interests lie within. We place ourselves first thinking we are always correct. After all, it's easy to point out life's problems until we realize that we are the cause.\n\nSome assume that Christianity will solve every earthly trouble. They think that God should destroy sin at their whim. When he doesn't, they declare that he is uncaring, unknowing, and irrelevant.\n\nWe know that God does great things. He fed 5,000. He brought two million Israelites safely through the Red Sea. He raised Lazarus. He saves you, me, and all believers. Still, he did (and does) these things in his own way at his own time to glorify his name.\n\nThroughout Scripture, God instructs us to wait patiently. \"Wait for the Lord; be strong and take heart and wait for the Lord\" (Psalm 27:14). \"There is a time for everything and a season for every activity under the heavens\" (Eccl. 3:1). \"You do not realize now what I am doing, but later you will understand\" (John 13:7).\n\nGod has a plan for everything, including life's problems. His solutions are timely and relevant. After all, they \"transcend all understanding\" (Philippians 4:7).\n\nReally, Christianity is relevant!\n\nJim Grasby is principal of Lakeside Lutheran High.\nReach him at 920.648.2321 or jgrasby@llhs.org\n\n\"Stop squirming!\" How many times have you said that, witnessed someone saying it, or wished someone would say it—perhaps to a restless child or two? Some may even recall hearing those words directed at them.\n\nGod also says, \"Stop squirming!\" The psalmist writes, \"Be still, and know that I am God\" (Psalm 46:10). Although our circumstances may differ from those of a fidgeting child, the message has a similar intent.\n\nLife often distracts us from our true purpose to \"love the Lord [our] God with all [our] heart and with all [our] soul and with all [our] strength and with all [our] mind\" (Luke 10:27). We frequently live life, not considering the consequences of our actions. When we focus only on the here-and-now, it is only a matter of time before we begin \"squirming\" after the world's allurements. Soon we find ourselves completely drawn away from our true purpose, only to follow an ungodly course.\n\nAt these times, God says, \"Be still, and know that I am God.\" His power, his wisdom, his goodness, and his righteousness are all we need. Furthermore, he makes them ours by grace through faith in Christ. When we are tempted to focus more on the present than on the hereafter, God's voice calls us back to the reality of making him our highest treasure.\n\n\"Stop squirming!\" God gives us all we need for this life and the life to come.\n\nJim Grasby is principal of Lakeside Lutheran High.\nReachThis month, we celebrate the births of two acclaimed presidents: Washington and Lincoln. As such, we should briefly consider the necessity and blessing of government, and how God uses it to advance his plan.\n\nThroughout history, government has not always been highly respected. The Church father Augustine stated, \"Justice being taken away, then, what are kingdoms but great robberies?\" The philosopher Thomas Paine concurred. \"Government, even in its best state, is but a necessary evil.\" Even Thomas Jefferson said, \"The two enemies of the people are criminals and government, so let us tie the second down with the chains of the Constitution so [it] will not become a legalized version of the first.\" Today, many echo similar sentiments, perhaps more colorfully.\n\nIn light of such attitudes about government, what should Christians think?\nFirst, we know that God establishes all governments—even corrupt ones. \"No authority exists except by God\" [Romans 13:1]. As such, we owe our government respect and allegiance because \"the one who rebels against the authority is opposing God's institution\" [v. 2].\n\nAt the same time, government can be a blessing. It provides peace and stability to society. It is God's \"agent…to bring punishment on the wrongdoer\" and his \"servant for our benefit\" [v. 4] to ensure that freedoms—including worship—are maintained.\nIt is sad that today Church and state are no longer on the same field as they once were. Long ago, both understood that they answered to God. However, society has separated them, and today government acts as if it were answerable to no one—not even God!\nChristians must remember that God establishes government. He causes nations and leaders to rise for his purpose, and then he allows them to fall.\n\nIn spite of the boasts of rulers and the sometimes reckless actions of government, take comfort that \"the One enthroned in heaven laughs\" [Psalm 2:4]. He controls everything and \"works for the good of those who love him\" [Romans 8:28].\n\nJim Grasby is principal of Lakeside Lutheran High School.

For them, 2018 brings hope that things will improve.\n\nWhether you have just had the greatest year of your life or you are incredibly glad to see 2017 pass, the truth remains: you are not alone — ever! Our God is \"with us\" and he is \"for us.\"\n\nChristmas is the season of God with us. Our Savior — Immanuel — is literally \"God with us.\" Though this world continually changes, God does not. He comforts us in his Word by proclaiming, \"I am the Alpha and the Omega, the First and the Last, the Beginning and the End\" (NIV 11, Revelation 22:12). He has always been with us, is always with us, and will always be with us.\n\nNot only is our God with us at all times, but he is for us. Christ is our brother who redeemed us from sin's curse. His holy life, innocent suffering and death, and glorious resurrection confirm Paul's assertion, \"If God is for us, who can be against us?\" (NIV 11, Romans 8:31).\n\nBegin 2018 trusting that God knows what is best. After all, he is with you and he is for you. \"[Christ] said to me, 'Look, I am making everything new!' He also said, 'Write, for these words are trustworthy and true.'\" (EHV, Revelation 21:5).\n\nGod bless your New Year!\n\nJim Grasby is Principal of Lakeside Lutheran High School. Reach him at 920.648.2321 or jgrasby@llhs.org\n\nSoon after school begins, Christmas decorations appear in stores. Then, sales start. Finally, it —Christmas music with messages of family, good times, presents, and Santa—commences. Although many love the season, just as many find it overwhelming or depressing.\n\nIn a world that does not know the true reason for Christmas, Christians must continually remind themselves, \"Today in the town of David a Savior has been born to you; he is the Messiah, the Lord\" (Luke 2:11).\n\nBy nature, we are not upright and godly. Sin so corrupts our nature that the psalmist's words fit everyone perfectly: \"All have turned away, all have become corrupt; there is no one who does good, not even one\" (14:3). In short, we have no hope.\n\nIn his grace and mercy, God sent One to pay sin's price. His Son became human, lived spotlessly, died innocently, and rose victoriously to pay humankind's debt for sin. No human effort, man-made strategy, or mortal plan could accomplish our salvation. It is full and free divine grace to all who hold the Savior by faith.\n\nThe angel's proclamation that first Christmas was \"music\" to the shepherds' ears. Imagine their joy when the angels announced, \"Today in the town of David a Savior has been born to you; he is the Messiah, the Lord.\" Their joy compelled them to find him. It led them to \"[glorify and praise] God for all the things they had heard and seen\" (Luke 2:20). The shepherd's jubilation may well be called the world's first Christmas \"song.\"\n\nDon't despair. Soon, the Christmas decorations will be stored. The unsold merchandise will disappear. The sappy, commercialized music will end.\n\nBut, our joy and hope in the Savior will not. It lives because Jesus truly is \"the Messiah, the Lord.\" God bless your Christmas celebration!\n\nJim Grasby is principal of Lakeside Lutheran.

{"text": "Painting helps heal Liberian artist\n\nPeter Glanville will offer paintings of Liberian artist again at the Jubilee Marketplace.\n\nPeter Glanville had no idea when he and his wife, Amber, decided to adopt a Liberian child that they would become involved in fair trade, helping artist Wilson Fallah sell oil paintings.\n\nThey met him in 2008, when they first went to Liberia, because it had a pilot program for international adoptions.\n\nThey were impressed with carvings, baskets, jewelry and crafts of other artists, who were poor and could not make a living selling their work in Liberia. Peter started a nonprofit, Four Corners Markets, to help Liberian artists market their crafts.\n\nThey sold some of their art, but now focus on Wilson's paintings on canvas, denim and other fabrics, which can be rolled and easily carried in a suitcase.\n\nHis paintings reflect post-war Liberia, capturing and helping people focus on the innocence of everyday Liberian life so they have hope that they can have a peaceful society. Most show village scenes of people working or playing music, and of women grinding grain or carrying water.\n\nWilson, now 26, was 19 when they met and had won awards as a youth artist. Forced to be a child soldier at the age of nine, he fought against Charles Taylor, ex-Liberian president who was later sentenced to a British prison for war crimes.\n\nAt the end of the civil war 10 years ago, Wilson, who is Christian, was adrift and had a hard time until he started to paint as a way to cope and heal. He paints to help others heal, too.\n\nHe has won many awards in Liberia for his artwork and has paintings featured in government buildings, including the U.S. Embassy.\n\nThe first year Peter sold his art at First Presbyterian Church's annual Jubilee International Marketplace, they sent him the proceeds, $1,500, quite a sum for someone living on $45 a month. Wilson used the money to buy musical instruments and a sound system so he could play music at weddings and events to earn regular income to help support his wife and two-year-old child.\n\nIn previous years, he also sold paintings at the Fall Folk Fest and weekend events. Now he's just sells the paintings at Jubilee.\n\nThe adoption, which was completed in 2009 when their son Henry was a year and a half, has changed Peter and Amber's lives in other ways. They also have two daughters, one 10 and one a baby.\n\nHenry has a neurological condition with spinal and growth problems like cerebral palsy. They see doctors in Spokane and Seattle often.\n\nSince they were about 12 years old, Peter and Amber had been living in a church community of 250 on a farm north of Colville.\n\nHis family had sold everything they had to move there from Phoenix. For 17 years, they lived in the community where Peter was a cabinetmaker.\n\nThey left the community a year after they adopted Henry to be closer to Spokane for his medical needs and so Peter could pursue a career in medicine.\n\nPeter's father, a physician, now lives in Colorado, provides medical care for anyone who needs it, regardless of their ability to pay,\" he said.\n\nFirst, Peter and Amber moved to Hayden, where he continued to run his cabinetmaking business. Five years ago, they moved to Spokane. They have been visiting different churches.\n\nHe started EMT training with AMR Ambulance to be a paramedic.\n\nThen he was accepted to the University of Washington in Spokane as a full-time student to be a physician assistant (PA). He graduated in September and started in family practice with Family Health Center.\n\nPeter would like to use his medical skills to help people overseas. He decided to be a PA rather than a MD because of his age and family.\n\n\"I like family practice because of relating with people in a breadth of conditions,\" he said.\n\nPeter went to the speech by Liberian President Ellen Sirleaf Johnson at Gonzaga University in October.\n\nShe said that Liberia has 218 medical doctors and 400 nurses serving 3 million people. During the Ebola outbreak, Liberia lost about 150 of nearly 800 medical personnel. On Sept. 3, the United Nations declared Liberia Ebola Free.\n\nBecause physician assistants (PA) are recognized as medical professionals in Liberia, Peter would like to go there on short-term visits to volunteer to teach physician assistants and he plans to sponsor people to go to a PA school there, where the cost of studies is one-tenth what it is in the United States.\n\n\"There is a desperate need for medical personnel there,\" he said.\n\nWhen Peter and Amber went to Liberia in 2008, they knew nothing about the country.\n\n\"We learned that the colony that would become Liberia was established in 1816 by American slaves sent back to re-colonize the area in Africa,\" Peter said.\n\nEllen Sirleaf Johnson said that the Americo-Africans came to Africa Americanized.\n\nSome had education and set up a government, but did not allow freedom or voting rights for indigenous people. That led to conflicts over the last nearly 200 years.\n\nIn 1980, there was a coup, and the first indigenous African leader came into power.\n\nThere were 20 years of civil war, which resulted in the deaths of hundreds of thousands of Liberians and destroying the infrastructure.\n\nPeter said there were horrific war crimes under the former president Charles Taylor.\n\n\"When we began the process of adopting Henry, Liberia was recovering from the civil war and there was a heavy presence of United Nations peacekeepers,\" he said.\n\nWith the UN presence over the last 15 years and the leadership of Ellen Sirleaf Johnson, Liberia made progress from extreme poverty and rebuilt infrastructure—generating stations, roads and buildings.\n\nPeter started Four Corners Markets to help struggling artists in Liberia market their crafts in Monrovia and abroad.\n\n\"The artists are poor. They make beautiful art, but cannot sell it and make a living,\" he said.\n\nWhen he was first there, he connected with a woodcarving co-op, a basket weaver, a shoemaker and tie dyers, as well as Wilson.\n\nThen he started studies to be a PA, and he could not afford to continue to help the other artists. He sold the items he had from them and sent the money to them.\n\nHe continues to work with Wilson.\n\n\"My goal is to bring him here for two months a year to paint, do exhibits and demonstrations, speak at schools and share his experiences as a child soldier,\" said Peter.\n\n\"He has never been out of Liberia and dreams of coming to America some day soon,\" Peter said.\n\n\"He had the fortitude to move beyond life as a child soldier and work for peace,\" said Peter, who communicates with him through missionary friends in Seattle who are building a hospital in Liberia.\n\nHe helped them raise $100,000 in medical equipment in the Spokane-Coeur d'Alene area.", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "f6677399-6f7d-4c18-abdd-d67d0b88176c", "url": "http://thefigtree.org/nov15/110115glanville.html"}

That's why we treat ourselves to a good mani-pedi sesh at least once a month so we can keep them looking great and healthy. But did you know that you can actually stop doing a few things to keep your nails healthy?\n\nIMAGE Kallista Nail Pamper Lounge\n\nWe recently got to chat with Cat Ilacad, the woman behind Posh Nails, during the press launch of Kallista Nail Pamper Lounge where she shared with us five things our manicurists and nail technicians want us to stop doing to our nails. Read them below!\n\n1. Stop biting your nails.\n\nWe develop this habit as kids whenever we're under pressure, and carry them with us as we grow older. Although we try to stop, nail-biting is just involuntary for us sometimes. \"To stop this, just ask your nail technician to put nail polish so you would be careful not to bite it and end up destroying the color,\" Cat suggested. \"The fact that it doesn't taste good also would help!\"\n\nADVERTISEMENT - CONTINUE READING BELOW\n\n2. Stop using your nails as tools.\n\n\"We have letter openers, can openers, scissors to do that for us. Take time to use these instead. Save your nails and manicure!\" Okay, now stop using your finger nails to do the hard work for you because you'll end up ruining them. How many times have you attempted to remove those staple wires on your paper and ended up with a broken fingernail?\n\n4. Don't forget your vitamins.\n\nYour nails' health depends on how healthy you are, too. She told us that we should always remember to take our vitamins. Cat said, \"Overall health and wellness is important so don't skip your vitamins so your nails will grow healthy and strong—specifically Biotin supplements. They increase thickness and prevent splitting and breakage.\"\n\n5. Let your nails breathe.\n\nAnd lastly, allow your nails to breathe for a while. Skip the nail polish for a week or even two. \"Don't use nail color all the time. Just like us, our nails need a breather, too. Let them rest.\"\n\nIMAGE Kallista Nail Pamper Lounge\n\nADVERTISEMENT - CONTINUE READING BELOW\n\nVisit Kallista Nail Pamper Lounge at the 2nd floor of S-Maison, Conrad Hotel Manila, Marina Way, Mall of Asia.

{"text": "Caspian Sea demarcation agreement could see more oil and gas flow\n\nSHARE\n\nWhen is a sea not a sea?\n\nThe Caspian is more than a kilometre deep at its deepest, it has waves and tides and its area is not much less than the Red Sea or Baltic. But, with no link to the oceans, its legal status has long been in dispute. A meeting in Kazakhstan this month aimed to resolve that, which could open up oilfields and pipeline routes.\n\nSoviet-era treaties allowed equal access to the surface waters but since the USSR's collapse, Iran has maintained the Caspian is a lake, which would give all five littoral states an equal share of its resources.\n\nBut Russia's position is complicated and the other neighbours, Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan and Azerbaijan, have generally maintained that, like maritime boundaries, the seabed should be demarcated by a median line equidistant from their shore, with some modifications. Under this method, Iran would receive the smallest share. Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan and Russia have already carved up the northern part of the sea on this basis, in 2003, and Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan agreed their border in 2015.\n\nWith this legal certainty, Kazakhstan has proceeded with development of the supergiant Kashagan oilfield, one of the largest found in the world over the past two decades, which started production in 2016. Russia has some smaller fields, while Azerbaijan has produced from its shallow offshore since 1950 and BP has operated its large Azeri-Chirag-Guneshli field since 1995. Dragon Oil, now wholly owned by the Dubai Government's Enoc, has enjoyed great success in developing the Cheleken oilfields off Turkmenistan. The billion-barrel Kyapaz/Serdar field, though, remains undeveloped in the absence of an accord between Turkmenistan and Azerbaijan.\n\nPresident of Kazakhstan Nursultan Nazarbayev (L), President of Russia Vladimir Putin (C) and President of Turkmenistan Gurbanguly Berdimuhamedow.\n\nMeanwhile, Iran has been left out of the Caspian oil rush, partly because of US and international sanctions, partly because of its failure to offer an attractive commercial model, and partly because of difficulties in drilling in the southern Caspian, the deepest part. Reservoirs are exceptionally far below the seabed and pressures high. With no access to oceans, drilling rigs have to be constructed in the Caspian itself, or disassembled and brought in via canals.\n\nIn 2001, Iranian gunboats warned off BP survey vessels working in a disputed area, on what Iran calls the Alborz field, and Azerbaijan refers to as Araz-Sharg-Alov. In 2012, Iran discovered the Sardar-e Jangal field in 700 metres of water south of Alborz, claimed to hold 50 trillion cubic feet of gas and 2 billion barrels of oil, but has not developed it. But in June, Tehran did reach agreement with Baku over joint development of another shared field.\n\nThe meeting of all five littoral states, in the Kazakh port of Aktau on August 12, settled some but not all of the outstanding questions. They agreed the Caspian is a sea but with a special legal status. The convention allows freedom of access by the signatories to all the Caspian's waters, prevents non-Caspian countries deploying military forces there and agrees that the seabed should be subdivided but without specifying how. It allows the states to reach bilateral agreements on demarcation and on the construction of pipelines, rather than requiring the consent of all.\n\nThe deal was received badly by many in Iran. Mahmoud Sedighi, a Reformist parliamentarian, tweeted that Iran's 50 per cent share of the sea had been reduced to 11 per cent, and compared the convention to the despised 1828 Treaty of Turkmenchay, which gave up much Iranian territory to the Tsar of Russia. Opponents complain that Russian warships will now rule the waves, and fear Iran will emerge with only a small claim over the sea's resources.\n\nBut Tehran's weak bargaining position forced it to sign. Better relations with its northern neighbours free its hands to concentrate on other threats. It is reliant on Russian support against sanctions and in Syria and it has to forestall the possibility of American or Israeli use of Azeri or Kazakh bases. And, unlike the others, it has failed to create \"facts on the seabed\" by developing any hydrocarbons in its undisputed sector.\n\nConversely, the accord could be good news for Turkmenistan. Holder of the fourth-largest gas reserves in the world, it sends most of its output to China, after Russia cut off its access to other markets. For more than two decades the prospect of a \"Trans-Caspian pipeline\" through Azerbaijan to access Turkish and European customers has long tantalised oil companies and European strategists keen to diversify away from Russian supplies. German chancellor Angela Merkel visited Baku, Azerbaijan's capital, on Saturday, with gas supplies on her agenda.\n\nDragon Oil, which has to burn off the unwanted gas from its oil production for lack of a route to market, is one of several companies that could supply the Trans-Caspian line. But opposition from Russia and Iran, tepid interest from Azerbaijan which would not want to facilitate a competitor to its own gas, and Turkmen indecision and inertia, have long stalled progress. There are several competitors, including Russia itself, to supply Europe at lower prices.\n\nAs I told a European envoy in 2012, purely political pipelines don't get built. Instead of the grand Trans-Caspian, or the Turkmenistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan-India pipeline persistently promoted by perspiring US diplomats, the Turkmens may sell a smaller amount of gas the short distance to Azerbaijan and perhaps Turkey.\n\nMore Caspian oil may also flow in the next few years if border demarcation proceeds. But Moscow can be confident that its minor concessions leave its gas markets secure. The convention has further reinforced Russia's guard on its soft underbelly, and emphasised Tehran's and Brussels' disadvantages.\n\nRobin M.

Dr. Jocelyn Grunwell, a pediatric critical care physician, led a provocative discussion on the Development of a Pediatric Assessment Tool for MRI. Discussion focused on the development of a rapid and simple screening questionnaire to determine score thresholds to predict children who should be referred to general anesthesia without over-referral. The tool consists of nine categories with a total of 42 questions. The goal of the tool is to increase the effectiveness of pre-screening in order to minimize same day cancellation rates which would in turn:\n\nDecrease patient backlog and MRI wait times\n\nDecrease ineffective use of scanner, physician and nursing time\n\nDecrease cost of lost school/work days\n\nIncrease parental satisfaction\n\nDr. Grunwell concluded that the Pediatric Assessment Tool can reliably predict same day cancellation and failures but should not replace clinical judgement. There are opportunities for improvement for both inpatient and outpatient MRI departments that can be addressed by utilizing the screening tools in multiple areas including outpatient, emergency, inpatient and ICU departments.

Because biomechanical changes along the spine affecting nerves and muscles don't heal like a cut, infection or some other self-resolving health condition.\n\nBy the time spinal problems produce obvious symptoms, the problem has existed for some time. A chiropractic care plan may produce symptomatic improvement in a matter of months, sometimes weeks. Though a patient may be delighted, we haven't completed the retraining of the underlying muscles and soft tissues necessary for lasting spinal changes.\n\nThat's why the original problem may return. It's hard to know when, but it's almost always after major physical, chemical or emotional stress. Without some type of ongoing care, the weakened area remains susceptible to re-injury. Should this happen to you, contact us. You're welcome back for another episode of care.\n\nThe Truth Behind Fake News\n\n\"Fake news\" seems to be thrown around a lot these days. It might surprise you to learn that chiropractors have known about this phenomenon for a while. How? By giving a critical eye to the latest claims made by the pharmaceutical industry.\n\nWhen the latest \"research\" hits the airways promoted as a new treatment, realize this may be a form of drug advertising passed off as journalism. It's not news, and should be evaluated thoughtfully. Take this –which sounds more appealing: A drug that reduces your risk of cancer by 50%, or a drug that eliminates cancer in 1 out of 100 people?\n\nThe first, right? Wrong. Both descriptions mean the very same thing! Let's say that the trial involves 100 people. During the trial, two people would normally be expected to get cancer. However, when all 100 people get the drug, only 1 person gets cancer—a 50% reduction.\n\nSo, even though the drug may help 1 of 100 people, its side effects may increase risks to all 100 people. Even though a chiropractor's \"side effects\" are largely positive, it rarely makes the news!", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "de5a5234-951c-4a1a-839e-2aaf4bfa20ea", "url": "https://www.olsonfamilychiropractic.com/2018-august"}

Splice the black wire in two and join them over the terminal screws - one particular on major and also the other over the bottom screw on the change. The white wire serves like a supply of uninterrupted electricity and is particularly typically linked to some light coloured terminal screw (e.g., silver).

Three key elements of authentic ministry are (1) proclaiming the good news of God's Kingdom, (2) teaching people how to live obediently to the will of God, and (3) ministering to their brokenness with the grace and power of God. With all the modern technologies we have today, we must always remember that ministry involves these same three elements if it is to be authentic.\n\nToday's Prayer\n\nAlmighty and compassionate Father, give me eyes to see and ears to hear those who need your grace—not just today, but every day.

{"text": "Top 5 Sexiest Female Demons/Devils\n\nThese women are so hot you won't even mind their possessive tendencies.\n\nNothing says Happy Halloween like scantily clad, horny women who want nothing else than to act sinfully. Halloween is a special time of year that causes people to behave and act in ways that are seemingly out of character and downright evil. Or are they?\n\nWomen dress like trashy whores. Men dress like… well, basically anything that will remotely pass as a costume so that they can attend the parties where women are dressed like trashy whores. Let's be honest here, the only reason an adult male (who can buy as much candy as he wants) would dress up in a cheesy costume on Halloween is so that he can attend the only party of the year where women seem to lose all of their inhibitions and dress as sexy as humanly possible. Am I right? Yeah, I know these comments may seem a little out of character for me, but the great thing about Halloween is that you can pretty much get away with anything and be whatever you want.\n\nIt's pretty obvious that supernatural forces are at work when you're having sex with Charlize Theron and you're imagining another woman.So in honor of Halloween, I'm going to step out of character a bit and repossess my role as a superficial male chauvinist pig. Hey, don't judge my costume and I won't call you a trashy, slutty whore for dressing like one! Let's just try and appreciate each other's costumes in all their extreme glory. Agreed? Good. Moving on.\n\nIt's not a big surprise that a man would get turned on by the idea of a woman who wants nothing more than to embrace immorality and sin, but throw in the notion that she's willing to do absolutely anything he desires and you'd be surprised at how quickly men will ignore the fact that she's really an evil bitch. Even if it's a woman who could easily be classified as completely heinous, one thing's for certain, men love female Demons/Devils.\n\nThis movie is about an undefeated Florida lawyer named Kevin Lomax, played by Keanu (\"Whoa\") Reeves, who gets offered a job with a high-end prestigious law firm in New York City. Initially the job is to utilize Kevin's uncanny ability to pick a jury, but it quickly becomes clear that there are strange things afoot at the Circle-K… er… I mean ulterior motives at play. Just after the jury delivers a rather rapid \"not guilty\" verdict, Kevin is introduced to the senior partner of the firm, John (Rufus) Milton, played by Al Pacino. John offers Kevin everything he and his wife, Mary Ann, played by Charlize Theron, could ever want in the form of a partnership at the firm, a huge New York apartment to live in and an extremely obscene salary. Kevin, who came from small town humble beginnings, jumps at the opportunity and moves him and his wife to New York, despite the warnings given by his Evangelical Christian mother… and his most excellent friend Bill. Seriously, I can't be the only one who is constantly waiting for Keanu Reeves to say \"Excellent\" in every single movie he's in, can I?\n\nNeedless to say, things become bogus, heinous and non-triumphant rather quickly as Kevin starts working incessantly while neglecting his displaced wife who then starts seeing all the other wives of the firm's lawyers as demons. To make matters even worse, Kevin starts fantasizing about one of the other top lawyers at the firm, Christabella Andreoli, played by Connie Nielsen. It's pretty obvious that supernatural forces are at work when you're having sex with Charlize Theron and you're imagining another woman, even if it is Connie Nielsen.\n\nEventually, Kevin's wife goes insane, just after John rapes and mutilates her (I mean, who wouldn't, right? Go insane I mean! Not the way you thought I meant it, pervert! Jeez!) and she ends up killing herself. His mother, being ever sensitive, then proceeds to tell Kevin that John Milton is his dad. So naturally, he goes to confront his dad and after getting confirmation that John raped his wife, Kevin tries to shoot him, but of course the bullets have no effect and he finally understands that John is in fact Satan. Whoa… bummer dude! However, not as big of a major buzzkill as finding out the woman you've been fantasizing about all this time is actually your sister. Whoa! Major incestual bummer, dude!\n\nHowever, that doesn't stop John from trying to convince Kevin to still have sex with his sister so that she can father the Anti-Christ. Now I don't want to get all technical here, but isn't Kevin, being the son of the devil and a human woman, actually the Anti-Christ already? Whatever, never mind, who cares about logistics as long as Connie Nielsen gets naked and lies down on an alter? Except, free will is a bitch and Kevin decides to shoot himself in the head instead of fucking his sister.\n\nPersonally, I don't know what's more disappointing when it comes to this movie, the fact that no one ever actually got to fuck Connie Nielsen, or that she didn't yell, \"You killed Ted, you medieval dickweed!\" when Satan's games caused Kevin to shoot himself. Either way, I guess the moral of the story is to just be excellent to each other. And… PARTY ON, DUDES!\n\nOh and Connie Nielsen, you have one bodacious body, you can lie on my altar any day.\n\n4. Tia Carrere as Akivasha aka Nalissa in Kull the Conqueror (1997)\n\nThere's absolutely no doubt that I'd rule behind her.\n\nOkay, I know I said it didn't matter how hellish their movies were, but if it wasn't for Tia Carrere this movie would have been actually painful to watch. It \"stars\" Kevin Sorbo, playing Kull, a barbarian warrior who becomes king by defeating the previous king in combat. The previous king's remaining heirs, however, conspire to overthrow him and reclaim their birthright by resurrecting a 3000 year old evil sorceress demon named Akivasha, played by Tia Carrere. Akivasha magically seduces Kull into marrying her, which only adds to the unbelievable ridiculous nature of this movie… as if Tia Carrere would need magic to seduce anyone! Akivasha then fucks Kull on their wedding night and then magically makes him unresponsive and dead asleep, which again probably didn't require magic either.\n\nWith the new king seemingly fucked to death, she becomes queen by default, because let's face it, any woman who can fuck like that, does absolutely rule. Anyway, eventually she wakes Kull up and offers him immortality and the chance to rule with her, which he promptly turns down. Now correct me if I'm wrong, but since he was already willing to rule with her, when he married her, I guess he really just doesn't want to fuck her for eternity.\n\nSee? I told you this movie was painfully ridiculous, I mean, who wouldn't want to fuck Tia Carrere for eternity? I know I would, but then maybe it's the fact that Tia Carrere is a long haired, mixed race, Asian American (Hawaiian, Chinese, Spanish and Filipino) which we all know from past articles, I have a severe weakness for. Or maybe it's the fact that she's an ex-Catholic school girl (attended Sacred Hearts Academy) who very clearly has a dark and naughty side to her, which let's face it, everyone has a weakness for. Or maybe it's just the fact that she's fucking hot as hell and not just in this role, but in every single movie or television show she does. Whatever the case, the idea of anyone, even someone as stupid as Kull the Conqueror, NOT wanting to fuck her for eternity is just too ludicrous for me to even bother telling you the rest of the movie. Just watch it, Tia Carrere is in it, which is reason enough to check it out, but she also just happens to be horny in every way possible.\n\nTia Carrere, I'll take you in any era and keep those fires burning down below for all eternity.\n\n3. Jennifer Love Hewitt as The Devil in Shortcut to Happiness (2003)\n\nIt's hard to believe anyone would ever have any objections to whatever this woman says.\n\nThis movie is about a down on his luck writer named Jabez Stone, played by Alec Baldwin, who is unsuccessful in just about every way possible. (I mean, we can't all be fantastically successful writers, am I right?) Unable to publish his writing, Jabez reaches rock bottom when his friend, Julius Jensen, played by Dan Aykroyd, finds success. In his desperation he states that he would sell his soul to trade places with his friend and just when he thought he couldn't sink any lower, he throws his typewriter out the window, killing an elderly woman in the process. Just then, his doorbell rings and he finds Jennifer Love Hewitt standing on his doorstep in a red leather trench coat.\n\nAfter she magically fixes his broken window and gets rid of the investigating police men, she lets on that she is the devil and will offer him ten years of success for the price of his mortal soul. I bet Diana Napolis (a.k.a. Karen Curio Jones) had a fucking field day with this movie! Never mind, moving on… To alleviate any reservations and guilt Jabez is having, she then brings the elderly woman back to life, as a demonstration of what she is capable of. Because apparently, magically fixing broken windows just isn't as impressive as it used to be. Personally, if Jennifer Love Hewitt showed up at my doorstep wearing a red leather trench coat, I'd probably just agree, right then and there, to whatever she wanted, but then that's just me.\n\nAfter finally realizing that she has the power to give him everything he ever wanted, he agrees to the exchange and asks if he should sign something. She responds by opening her trench coat, revealing her extremely low cut, little, black dress and then jumps on top of him to consummate the deal. Not for nothing, but in the future, she might want to lead with the fact that fucking her is how they seal the deal and just forgo the magical window fixing and resurrection bullshit, you know, in the interest of time management and high throughput soul gathering. Just saying.\n\nAnyway, after she leaves, everything turns around for Jabez Stone and he obtains instant fame, success, wealth and women. However, as with most deals made with the devil, it doesn't go according to plan and he eventually realizes that he ultimately is still empty and dissatisfied with his life. By the way, did I mention that he got to fuck Jennifer Love Hewitt? Oh… I did? Yeah, okay, I just thought I'd throw that out there again in case anyone was beginning to believe the whole dissatisfied with life horseshit So what have we learned from this movie? Basically, if Jennifer Love Hewitt shows up at your door in a red leather trench coat, agree to whatever she says, fuck her brains out and then sue her in order to feel satisfied with your life. God bless the judicial system.\n\nJennifer Love Hewitt, you can use psychotronic, cybertronic, or any other kind of weaponry you want, in order to control my mind and manipulate my body, as long as we get to fuck to seal the deal first.\n\n2. Elizabeth Hurley as The Devil in Bedazzled (2000)\n\nThere wouldn't be any idle hands associated with this Devil, that's for damned sure!\n\nElliot Richards, played by Brenden Fraser, is a geeky, awkward and hopeless Synedyne technical support nerd with no friends and absolutely no romantic prospects. However, that doesn't stop him from having a lovesick crush on his co-worker Alison Gardner, played by Frances O'Connor, who doesn't even know he exists. After being teased and goaded, into trying to talk to Alison, by some of the other company employees, Elliot completely strikes out with Alison and utters the words, \"Dear God, I would give anything to have that girl in my life.\"\n\nEnter Elizabeth Hurley, in a smoking hot, little, red dress which is just one of countless delicious outfits she wears in this movie. Seriously, the costume designer of this movie, Deena Appel, deserves an award for every single flawlessly sexy costume that Elizabeth Hurley appears in…(slow clap) Well done, Deena, well done indeed! Anyway, what was I saying? Oh right, I was talking about entering Elizabeth Hurley…er I mean Elizabeth Hurley's entry… er… Phew, is it hot in here, or is Hugh Grant completely fucking crazy for cheating on Elizabeth Hurley with some ratchet ass hooker?\n\nAnyway, after Hurley reveals that she is the devil, she offers Elliot seven wishes for the price of his soul. Now normally, when it comes to women, obviously you don't want to contract a single thing, but in this case I'd probably jump at the chance. Elliot, after a little convincing, signs the contract and wishes to be with Alison. Of course, because she's the devil, Hurley doesn't grant Elliot's wish without a wicked little twist. In fact, she doesn't grant any of Elliot's wishes to be with Alison without a catch of some kind, which is likely why she provided him with a little red pager to call her and eject from the wish.\n\nTime after time and sinfully seductive outfit after sinfully seductive outfit, Hurley brings Elliot back to reality just before everything crashes down around him. In the end, Elliot uses his last remaining wish for Alison to have a happy life and due to a technicality in his contract, which states if he commits one truly benevolent act then the contract is void, he gets to keep his soul.\n\nAfter escaping eternity in hell, Elliot has some newly found confidence and asks Alison out again only to find out that she's seeing someone. However, when he goes home, he discovers that he has a new neighbor, named Nicole, who not only looks exactly like Alison, but is equally as dorky as Elliot ever was and they live happily ever after. Personally, eternity with Elizabeth Hurley prancing around in skimpy little sexy costumes seems like happily ever after to me, but then I'm a horny little devil myself.\n\nTo be honest, I almost feel bad for Elizabeth Hurley now, because I REALLY wanted to give her the number one spot, but I couldn't in good conscious ignore the fact that Megan Fox played a succubus in Jennifer's Body. I mean, it's fucking Megan Fox, she'd win the title of sexiest demon woman just for showing up and I'm not just basing that on her actual personality. Megan Fox is about as sexy as it comes, but in this movie, she's quite literally to die for. She plays Jennifer Check, a confident and self-absorbed high school cheerleader in a small rural town. That's right, you read that correctly, Megan Fox in a cheerleading outfit. Need I say more for you to see this movie?\n\nHer best friend and the narrator of the story is Anita \"Needy\" Lesnicki, an insecure, nerdy teenager played by Amanda Seyfried, who does just about everything Jennifer says. One night, the two of them go to a local dive bar to see an indie rock band who unbeknownst to them are playing there to find a sacrificial victim to use in a demonic ritual in order to become famous. After the club mysteriously burns down and everyone is in shock, the band convinces Jennifer to get into their creepy van and drives off.\n\nLater that night, Jennifer shows up at Needy's house, covered in blood, acting like a bizarre ravenous animal and pukes up weird, black, spiky fluid all over the kitchen before leaving. The next day at school, Jennifer acts like nothing happened and when Needy questions her about it, she plays it off like Needy is just over reacting. While the whole town is grieving over the loss of all the people who died in the bar fire, Jennifer seduces the football captain only to eat him alive and not in a good way. Then a month later (yeah, they kind of just gloss over an entire month) Jennifer, apparently needing further nourishment, seduces, kills and eats the school's token emo kid. Then Megan Fox and Amanda Seyfried make out….\n\nSeriously, lez be honest, does it really matter what happens after that? Fine, whatever, but what's really the point? You're still thinking about Megan Fox and Amanda Seyfried making out, or maybe that's just me. Anyway, Jennifer explains that the band needed a virgin for their sacrifice and because Jennifer wasn't a virgin (Um, Duh!) the ritual allowed a demonic spirit to take over her body, effectively turning her into a succubus. But who are we kidding, Jennifer was probably a succubus before, I mean she's easily sucked off an entire bus load of people, am I right?\n\nJennifer then seduces Needy's boyfriend, Chip, whom she eventually kills causing Needy to go after Jennifer with a vengeance. Because Needy is a nerd and nerds do their research, she already knows that Jennifer can be killed by stabbing her in the heart when she is weak and hasn't fed in a while. So Needy goes to Jennifer's house, when Jennifer is hungry, which results in a Megan Fox/Amanda Seyfried cat fight on Jennifer's bed ending in Jennifer's last words, \"My tit\" after Needy stabs her in the heart. Okay fine, maybe Megan Fox didn't just show up to win the title of sexiest demon woman, but rather seduced, wrestled, clawed and bit her way to the top of the list and I'm just talking about how she acted with her female co-star, let alone her male ones.\n\nMegan Fox, feel free to devour me whenever you want.\n\nSo there you have it, the Top Five Sexiest Female Demons/Devils, brought to you by a superficial, male chauvinist pig (for a day). I would now like to exorcise my right to give a brief honorable mention to some devilishly sexy women, who didn't make the final cut, but it would be a sin not to mention.\n\nAmelia (Mimi) Kinkade as Angela in Night of the Demons (1988)\n\nEmma Caulfield as Anyanka in Buffy the Vampire Slayer: The Wish (1998-2003)\n\nEmmanuelle Seigner as The Girl in The Ninth Gate (1999)\n\nHeidi Mark as Darla in Charmed: She's a Man, Baby, a Man! (1999)\n\nBai Ling and Heather Stephens as Jhiera and Shari in Angel: She (2000)\n\nI'm sorry devil women, as wicked as your beauty may be, I had to banish you to the underworld in order to keep it under five. Besides, what's the worst thing you could do to me, tempt and seduce me into spending eternity with you? Call me crazy, but somehow the idea of a morally wrong and sinful woman, doesn't scare me in the least.\n\nSo to all the frightfully sexy, seductive, smoking hot, female demons/devils out there, I say, \"Get me behind thee!\"", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "b054f55c-ea89-4006-bf13-c72d48622cdd", "url": "https://www.pointsincase.com/columns/top-5-sexiest-female-demons-devils?replytocom=121000"}

{"text": "Everything You Should Know When It Comes To Student Loans\n\nA student loan will be something you must consider if you go to college. Maybe it's now, or it could be later on. Whatever the case may be, if you learn what you need to know on the subject of student loans, you can get one that fits your needs. Below, you will find many tips to help you make sense of it all.\n\nDon't panic if you can't make a payment due to job loss or another unfortunate event. Usually, many lenders let you postpone payments if you are able to prove hardship. Just know that the interest rates may rise.\n\nKnow how long the grace period is between the date of your graduation and the date on which you must start repaying the loans. Stafford loans typically give you six months. For Perkins loans, the grace period is nine months. Other loans offer differing periods of time. Know what you have to pay when, and pay on time!\n\nPay the largest of your debts first. The smaller your principal, the smaller the amount of interest that you have to pay. Pay off the largest loans first. Once it is gone, you can focus on smaller loans. If you make minimum payments on your loans while paying as much as possible on the largest loan, you can eradicate your loan debt.\n\nBefore accepting the loan that is offered to you, make sure that you need all of it. If you have savings, family help, scholarships and other types of financial help, there is a chance you will only need a portion of that. Do not borrow any more than necessary since it will make it harder to pay it backIt can be hard to figure out how to get the money for school. A balance of grants, loans and work is usually necessary. When you work to put yourself through school, it is important not to overdo it and negatively affect your performance. Although the specter of paying back student loans may be daunting, it is usually better to borrow a little more and work a little less so you can focus on your school workYou might need a student loan for yourself or a child in the future. The more you know about these loans, the easier it is to find the best one for your own needs.

{"text": "In a nutshell\n\nThis study investigated the effectiveness of a radionuclide (RN), [¹??Lu]-PSMA-617, to treat metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) that has worsened after standard treatments. They found that this treatment was safe and effective for these patients.\n\nSome background\n\nProstate cancer (PC) affects the prostate gland. The prognosis for PC is good if it is treated at an early stage. If cancer spreads it is called metastatic. This is more difficult to treat. One option is a procedure to cut off the supply of testosterone. This is called castration. Unfortunately, this does not work for all patients. This type of PC is called metastatic castration-resistant PC (mCRPC).\n\nNew treatments for mCRPC are needed. Using compounds that are more selective could be useful. These could target tumors more efficiently. Radionuclides (RN) are small molecules that can attach to proteins. They emit a radiation signal that kills the tumor cell. Lutetium-177 [¹??Lu]-PSMA-617 is a RN that targets prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA). PSMA is a protein found in high levels on the surface of prostate cancer. Targeting PSMA tumor cells may be an effective treatment for mCRPC.\n\nMethods & findings\n\nThis study included 30 men with mCRPC. Patients were assessed for PSMA levels. All patients underwent radiation treatment with [¹??Lu]-PSMA-617. There were up to 4 treatment sessions. This involved an intravenous infusion every 6 weeks. Patients were assessed up to 3 months after the treatment ended. PSMA levels were measured. Scans were also performed to assess the response to treatment.\n\n29 out of 30 patients (97%) had PSMA reductions to some degree. 57% of patients had a significant reduction in PSMA levels (of 50% or more). A more than 50% reduction in PSMA was associated with higher survival rates.\n\nNo treatment-related deaths were observed during the study. Side effects were generally mild. They included dry mouth (1 patient), nausea and fatigue (15 patients). Low platelet count was reported in 4 patients. Pain severity scores improved at all timepoints.\n\nThe bottom line\n\nThe authors concluded that the radionuclide treatment with [¹??Lu]-PSMA-617 was effective and safe in patients with mCRPC who have worsened after standard treatments.\n\nThe fine print\n\nThis trial included a relatively small number of patients. In addition, only patients with a specific PSMA level were included in the trial. Although it is encouraging, further studies are needed to determine the effectiveness of this treatment.", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "d80b0593-48ce-41c9-bf1e-f576d3141ff1", "url": "https://medivizor.com/blog/SampleLibrary/prostate-cancer/evaluating-a-radionuclide-treatment-for-metastatic-castration-resistant-prostate-cancer/"}

{"text": "Sermons from St Peter & St Paul, Seal, Kent\n\nPages\n\nSunday, 28 April 2019\n\nIn the beginning was\nthe Word and the Word was with God and the Word was God…and the Word became\nflesh and dwelt among us, and we have seen his glory.John 1.1 & 14\n\nYou may have wondered whether I have slipped a season or two\n– those are words which we often hear at Christmas, the final reading at\ntraditional carol services, the reading which opens Midnight Mass, as a tiny\nlight is brought into the darkened church.\n\nThey're the opening words of John's Gospel. Like all the\nbest opening words they give us a clue about what the rest of the book will be\nabout. \"It is a truth universally\nacknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in\nwant of a wife.\" You don't need to know the plot of Pride and Prejudice to know that we are in for a story about a rich\nyoung man's journey towards the married state. \"It was the best of times; it was the worst of times\" Dicken's Tale of Two Cities, set during the\nFrench Revolution starts with a clear signal that we are in for a roller-coaster\nride of triumph and tragedy.\n\nJohn's Gospel begins with words that tell us equally clearly\nwhat we are going to be hearing about – the key themes he wants us to keep in\nmind. This is going to be a story about the Word, about God speaking to us. But\nthis word won't be written on a page; it is going to be expressed through\nflesh, and in that flesh we will see God's glory. God is going to speak through a human being,\nthrough the whole of his life, all the physical stuff that all human people go\nthrough – being born, growing, eating, sleeping, rejoicing, suffering, dying.\n\nWe will see Jesus sharing a wedding feast at Cana, thirsty at a well in Samaria, asking a woman\nfor a drink because he hasn't got a bucket, being anointed just before his\ndeath. We will see Jesus caring for the flesh of others too, healing the sick,\nfeeding the hungry, washing feet. And, ultimately we will see Jesus' flesh\nbeaten and crucified, Jesus' flesh, the flesh of the Word made flesh, dying and\nbeing laid in a stone cold tomb, while his disciples, afraid for their own\nflesh, hide away.\n\nToday's Gospel reading comes from what was originally the\nvery end of John's Gospel – another chapter, a sort of extended P.S. was added\nvery early on – but it was meant to end here, with Jesus, standing among this\ndisciples, God's Word having the last word, a glorious word, stronger than\ndeath, buta word which is still very\ndefinitely flesh, the same flesh as they had seen crucified. Jesus still bears\nthe marks of the nails and the wound of the spear in his side. He isn't some\nincorporeal ghost, a wispy spirit, or a figment of their imagination. He is a body,\na flesh and blood body. I can't explain that, but it is what the story insists\non. His wounds haven't been airbrushed away. So his resurrection isn't about\ntranscending the limitations of the flesh. It is a glorification of that flesh,\na declaration that - just as it is - wounded and battered, flesh that has\nliterally been to hell and back, this is flesh which is full of God's glory.\n\n\"The Word became flesh\nand dwelt among us, and we have seen his glory\". That doesn't just refer to\nthe baby lying in the manger, shining in the darkness of Christmas nigh – in\nfact John doesn't tell any birth stories of Jesus, so it probably doesn't refer\nto that at all. It is really about this moment, when a wounded Jesus stands\nbefore his friends , in flesh which has suffered and died, and beenraised from death.\n\nWhatever else we might draw from the story of the resurrection\nwe are meant to draw the message that bodies are blessed, that God, in his\nglory, chose to dwell in them, just as they are, wounded, beaten, scarred. Our\nbodies are not prisons for our spirits – however much they may sometimes feel\nlike that. They aren't a second best, from which death will set us free. Our\nflesh, our day to day bodily existence, just as it is, can be a message of\nGod's glory, of God's love.\n\nBut to be that, our flesh, like Jesus', needs to be filled\nwith God's life. Jesus breathes on the frightened disciples in that locked room.\n\"Receive the Holy Spirit\" he says – there's no waiting for the Day of Pentecost\nfor the coming of the Spirit in John's story. The Spirit is given right now, to\nthis bunch of stunned disciples , who aren't ready for it in any sense, who are\nconscious at this moment only of their own failure and misery. Fine friends\nthey turned out to be, deserting Jesus just when he needed them most. But it is\ninto their frail flesh that God's Spirit is breathed.\n\nThe Gospel writer surely means us to remember the story from\nthe book of Genesis of the creation of Adam. God makes a creature out of mud.\nIt's fine. It's God's handiwork, but it's lifeless. So God leans over and\nbreathes into it his own breath – his Spirit – the words are interchangeable in\nHebrew - and the creature stirs and sits\nup and lives. Adam becomes a living being, a \"nephesh\" in Hebrew, the living\nbeing that God intends him to be, a combination of God-created flesh and\nGod-breathed Spirit. Both are essential, both are blessed - and both are holy.\n\nThe story of Jesus isn't the story of a comic book\nsuperhero, who swoops down with his special powers to save the day. It is a\nstory of a flesh and blood person, who shows us how much God loves our flesh\nand blood, in all its wonder and its woundedness, in all the joy and sorrow\nthat comes to it as we are born, grow, grow old and die.\n\nThat's a vital message for us to take in, for ourselves and\nfor others.\n\nThe ancient Greeks, whose thought world shaped the thinking\nof John's first readers, still shapes our world. In Greek, the word for\nbeautiful – kalos – is the same as\nthe word for good. To be beautiful was to be good; to be good was to be\nbeautiful. We have never really moved on from that; heroes and heroines in\nfilms are still rarely ugly. Young people obsessively post selfies online,\ntrying to produce the best version of themselves, anxiously watching for their\npeers to \"like\" the pictures they've posted. Older people fight the signs of\naging. Many of us really don't much like our bodies. \"Keep\nyoung and beautiful; it's your duty to be beautiful . Keep young and beautiful if\nyou want to be loved,\"says the old\nsong. Well, no, not in God's eyes. The resurrection shows us that God loves us,\nwounds and all, warts and all. God uses us wounds and all, warts and all. God's\nglory can shine from us, wounds and all, warts and all. In fact, it is the\nwounds and the warts which are the most powerful testimony of his life at work\nin us, the times of failure and weakness in which his glory is most powerfully\nseen.\n\nThe Easter story isn't just about the resurrection of Jesus'\nlifeless body from the grave; it is also about the resurrection that comes to\nhis disciples when he appears to them. Jesus isn't the only one in this story\nwho has known death.His disciples are stuck in the death of hope,\nso fearful of what might happen next that they daren't even stir from the room\nwhere they are hiding. Jesus may have been held fast in the tomb by the stone\nacross its entrance, but they have locked themselves in a tomb of their own, in\na sort of living death. They need the breath of life to be breathed into them\njust as much as Jesus did if they are going to get up and go out into the world\nto become living Words themselves, ways in which God can speak to others and\ntell them that God loves them.\n\nWe often need the same, as we huddle in our own locked rooms\n– the locked rooms of depression or anxiety or hopelessness. And we pray today\nespecially, of course, for our brothers and sisters in Sri Lanka, whose church\nservices have been cancelled, and who have been told to worship at home\ninstead, literally shut in their rooms for fear of those who might harm them.\nWe pray that they will feel the breath of God giving peace to their wounded\nsouls and bodies as they read this story today.\n\nAn ancient Christian writer called Irenaeus famously said \"The\nglory of God is a human being, fully alive.\"The resurrection of Jesus doesn't just show us\nGod's glory in him; it shows us the glory that can shine from all our frail and\nbattered flesh if we will let him breathe his life into us and raise us from our\ndeaths.\n\nI started with the beginning of John's Gospel. I will finish\nwith its original end, the words that end today's reading, John's prayer that\nwe may know, and show, the glorious life of God.\n\n.

(scroll down to hear the hymn)\n\nThe hymn we have just sung has a story attached to it, as so many hymns do.\n\nIt was written by a Church of Scotland minister George Matheson, in the late 19th century. This was a man whom life had dealt a rough hand. As a child, he had begun to lose his sight, and by the time he was grown up was virtually blind.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nThat's the reality of human life, the reality which Matheson knew and which those who love this hymn, as I do, recognise and respond to.\n\n\n\nIt's tempting, on Good Friday, to want to hurry on to Easter.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\nAmen\n\nMonday, 8 April 2019\n\nA pound of costly perfume made of pure nard, poured out over\nJesus' feet. It is reckoned to have been worth thousands of pounds in today's money.\nThis was an extravagant gift, an extravagant gesture.\n\nNard was used to anoint the dead, among other purposes, and\nit was very pungent stuff, made from the spikenard plant. Maybe it had been\nbought when Mary's brother, Lazarus had died. But Jesus had restored him to\nlife, so it wasn't needed. We don't know, but, as I said, Judas had a point.\nThe Gospel writer casts doubt on Judas' motives, suggesting he was stealing\nfrom the common purse, and maybe he was, but whether that's true or not, this\ndoes look like a terrible waste.It\ncould indeed have been sold and the money given to the poor.\n\nBut Jesus defends Mary. She's recognised what none of the\nrest of them have, that he really is going to die. She's seen that he knows\nthis, and that he needs this loving, tender gesture, an action which communicates\nher care for him. Jesus didn't go to his death with unruffled courage. He wept\nand prayed and sweated blood in the Garden of Gethsemane. He knew that crucifixion\nwas the inevitable result of sticking to his message – you didn't challenge the\nauthorities and get away with it in his world – but he didn't want crucifixion,\nno sane human being would. Mary saw his struggle and his pain, and she did what\nshe could to give him her support. She gave him what she had, all that she had,\nthat precious jar of ointment, because that's what he needed at this moment.\n\nAs I said, nard is pretty pungent stuff. \"The house was filled with the fragrance\",\nwe're told and my guess is that the smell clung to Jesus for a long time\nafterwards. Perhaps he could still smell a faint trace of it when he was\narrested, beaten, crucified. Perhaps it reminded him that though the cruelty\nand pain were real, the love he'd been shown was real too.\n\nMary gave what she could. It might not have looked like a\nsensible use of resources to those around her, but she knew that cost/benefit\nanalyses don't always tell you what you most need to know. Balance sheets are\nimportant, but they often can't measure the things that matter most to us.\n\nMary's extravagant gift here reminds me of the story of\nanother gift in John's Gospel, a few chapters earlier. It might not seem\nanything like as lavish, but to the person who gave it, it was everything.\n\nIt's in John chapter 6 if you're interested. A great crowd –\nthousands and thousands of men, women and children - had followed Jesus out\ninto the wilderness to listen to him preach. The day had drawn on, and suddenly\neveryone realised they were hungry. Jesus said to his disciple, Philip, \"Where are we to buy bread for these people\nto eat?\" Philip, ever the realist, answered, \"Six months wages wouldn't be enough to give people even a little\".\nJesus had set them an impossible task. Logically speaking there was nothing\nthey can do here ; they would have to send people home hungry. It seemed they\nhad nothing to work with.Looking around\nrather desperately for any scrap of hope, though, Andrew announces \"There\nis a boy here who has five barley loaves and two fish\" but he then quickly\ndismisses the thought that that might help, \"what\nare they among so many?\"Five loaves\nand two fish aren't even going to scratch the surface of the hunger of this\nvast crowd; that's obvious to any rational person.\n\nBut Jesus only seems to hear the first part of Andrew's statement. \"There is a boy here who has five barley loaves and two fish\". Jesus\nsees what they have, not what they haven't. He sees that this small boy, in\noffering his lunch, is giving everything he has. I don't know about you, but\nmost small boys of my acquaintance are extremely reluctant to be parted from\ntheir food, but this boy gives it willingly, his best, his all. That's what\nJesus sees – a generous gift, a loving gesture. And that's why he knows it will\nbe enough, because in God's economy, it isn't the size of the gift that matters,\nit's the size of the love with which it is given. In the same way, Mary's gift\nof this precious ointment isn't sensible, logical, practical – you can't\nprevent crucifixion by anointing someone's feet – but it makes all the\ndifference in the world to Jesus. The love with which it is offered makes it\npriceless, something which sustains Jesus through this terrible time. It might\nlook like a waste, but love is never wasted.\n\nBoth these stories encourage us to be aware of the gifts we\nhave to offer, an important thing to do as we come to our Annual Meeting after\nthis service.Our gifts may not seem\ngreat, like those loaves and fishes. Like Andrew, we might say \"what are these among so many?\" , \"What can\nI do that will be any use?\". We might look at our church and think, \"if only we had a spare million pounds or\nso, or a hundred more people, or a decent heating system and some toilets, just\nimagine what we could achieve…\" But when we think like this we often miss what we have, the precious\ntreasures God has given us, as individuals and as a church; our\npersonalities, our experiences, our voices, our time and\ntalents, the particular strengths of being who we are. We may not be\nable to do what others people or churches do, but they can't do what we can\neither. We are called to offer what we have, not what we haven't, to serve as\nwe can, not as we can't.\n\nOur gifts, like that small boy's lunch, may not always seem\ngreat, but in Jesus hands, they can do much more than we imagine. Our gifts may\nnot always seem practical or sensible, like Mary's outpoured ointment, but they\nmight make all the difference to others. We may see a sick friend and be aware\nthat all we have to offer is prayer, or a hug, or a cake, when we know that\nwhat they really need is a cure for cancer. But that prayer, that hug, that\ncake may give them the strength to get through it. We could draw up a list of\nskills we wish we had on tap in our church – I bitterly regret that there was\nno module on boiler maintenance in my ordination training! – but we are great\nat loving and welcoming people, and if I had to choose between a cold\nchurch and a warm welcome, I go for the warm welcome anytime. Judas complains\nabout the waste of money that Mary's offering represents. He doesn't understand\nthat love is never wasted.\n\nAt our Diocesan Clergy Conference last autumn, one of our\nmost inspiring speakers was the Director of Social Justice for the Diocese of\nLiverpool, Canon Ellen Louden. After many years of working in the area of mission\nand social justice, she'd come up with what she called her 12 rules for Christian\nActivists – and surely we should all be Christian Activists, people who act to help the kingdom of God grow\nin our midst. I won't go through them all, but there was one which really stuck\nwith me. \"Identify the good things\" she\nsaid, \"and give good things away\". Find\nthe best things you do as a church, your treasures, and give them away. It is\nso tempting to try to hoard and protect and control what we think our treasures\nare, in the church or as individuals, to be precious about them. It is tempting\nonly to give away what is leftover or doesn't cost us much to lose – like the\npile-it-high-and-sell-it-cheap \"loss leaders\" you see in supermarkets which aren't\nreally worth much, but lure you in to buy more of the expensive stuff. Churches\ndo this when they attract people in with a glossy programme of events, but then\nmake people jump through hoops really to belong, insist that they must believe\nand behave as the existing members of the church do before their voices can be\nheard. \"You can't just let any Tom, Dick\nor Harriet in; they might change things!\"\n\nEllen Louden said that she'd learned that the churches that\nreally made a difference in their communities were the ones who were\nopen-handed with the things they did well, who identified the things they were\nbest at, and gave them away freely, the churches which didn't set barriers\naround their church life, but let everyone share their gifts and their\nopinions, whoever they were and however long they'd been there.\n\nOne of the reasons we set up our Talking Village initiative was\nthat we recognised that talking is something we've got a gift for! We're a\nwelcoming and inclusive community; that's one of our strengths. We've learned\nthat and proved it over many years; Know Your Neighbours, Friday Group, our new\nCommunity Lunch, all those village events we've been involved with, often\nforming the bulk of the organising group. They aren't the answer to all the\nworld's ills, but they make life better, and people who needed company and\nsupport have found it through them. God has been at work, blessing people and\nenriching our community. And part of the reason for that is that we have,\nperhaps unconsciously followed Ellen Louden's rule, identifying this skill, but\nthen giving it away, involving everyone who wants to be part of running those\nthings whether a part of the church or not,rather than trying to hold onto and control them ourselves.\n\nOur Annual Meeting, after this service, gives us a chance to\ncelebrate the things we do well – and there are many of them – to identify our\ngood things. We look back, and look forward as we think about our church's\nlife. As we do, it's great to be reminded of this Gospel story, of Mary's\nextravagance as she gave the best thing she had, poured it out, literally, in a\ngesture that looked completely wasteful. But love is never wasted. Her story reminds\nus to notice what we have rather than what we lack, what is most precious to us,\nnot so that we can hoard it protectively for ourselves, but so we can give it\naway, knowing that as we do, God will bless it and use it for the good of all.\nAmen\n\nSunday, 31 March 2019\n\nAudio version here Exodus 1.8-10,13-22, Luke 1.39-56 On this Mothering Sunday I've put some pictures in our service sheets of a very famous mother, probably the mother who has been painted, drawn and sculpted more often than any other mother in history. It's Mary, the mother of Jesus.\n\n In.\n\nThe pictures come from Medieval Books of Hours, ancient collections of prayers which people used for their personal devotions. The. These She. You. Of going to get the better of her! She was a woman with guts and passion. She stands in a long line of mothers who have been equally strong through the ages, mothers like those who have turned up every week in the Plaza de Mayo in Buenos Aires They found a way. So Pharaoh same Anger. So is tough, for the fierce mothers in our lives, whoever they are or have been. And. Amen More about the origins of Mothering Sunday and about these images here. \n\nSunday, 24 March 2019\n\nI've got a cherry tree in my garden which is at least 10\nyears old. Hopefully it will soon be in beautiful white blossom which is most welcome\nof course, but the total amount of fruit is has produced since it was planted\nwould be enough to fill, well, a couple of coffee mugs. A bit like the fig tree\nin the parable, I have thought about cutting it down but live in hope that if I\ngive it one more year there will at least be enough for one cherry pie.\n\nOne interpretation of the Fig Tree Parable could be to see\nGod as the landowner, Jesus as the gardener and us as the fig tree. Despite\nfailing to reach fruition Jesus wants to nourish us and give us more time. But\nlike many of Jesus parables people it offers a lot more potential than the\nobvious.\n\nWhen I took a moment it occurred to me that actually I have\nunrealistic expectations for my cherry tree, I just hope as each year passes\nthat the tree will yield a decent crop but I haven't actually got off my\nbackside to do anything about it. I haven't given it any fertilizer, any nourishment.\n\nThe parable of the fig tree is a great one for us to consider\nin lent. It's a time to think deeply about our relationships, with each other\nand with the wider world community. The best starting point is to consider our\nrelationship with God through Christ. Is it less than it could be because we\nare guilty of failing to nourish and nurture our faith, or maybe it's time to\ntry something new in the service of each other. We are reminded that doing\nnothing will change nothing.\n\nIf we take time to reflect on our own lives this lent, we\nshould find encouragement in our gospel reading. After all who can honestly\nrecite the lines of Edith Piaf , singing 'Non je ne regrette rien', I regret\nnothing? Most of us have some 'baggage' which we 'haul around' sometimes\nholding us back from achieving our full potential and at its worst mistakenly\nleading us to believe that life's great sadnesses and challenges are somehow\ndeserved.\n\nLet's resolve to be kinder to ourselves as well as each\nother this lent, God isn't looking for opportunities to punish us he wants us\nto thrive and live abundant productive lives in whatever setting we find\nourselves.\n\nMany people are distinctly uncomfortable with the\nsuggestion that for many things there simply is no logical explanation. They\nlike to believe that mankind has conquered all, understands all, can explain\nall when the truth is that our world has layers of complexity which we may\nnever penetrate.\n\nPerhaps we'd be better to consider whether God would prefer\nus to react emotionally rather than trying to explain away the reason when sad things\nhappen. Perhaps some use attempts at explanation as a barrier to the fact that\nour turn to suffer will also inevitably come and for them fear is still more\nreal than God's grace.\n\nYet most of us know from personal experience that when we\ndo find the courage to sit with the suffering and dying, particularly those\nknown and loved by us, very few regret having done so, however painful the\nexperience may be.\n\nThe question of whether God sends down punishment upon\nsinners was aired when in 1984 when a fire occurred at York Minster. It\nhappened just two nights after David Jenkins was consecrated as Bishop of\nDurham there. He had previously caused a stir when he questioned the virgin\nbirth among other things.\n\nClearly God was annoyed about this and thought to himself\n'How shall I punish such impunity? Mmmm I know I won't totally destroy one the\nfinest Cathedrals in England, and I don't feel like killing him, I think I'll\njust take out the South Transept roof, that should be enough to teach him a\nlesson' so a lightening bolt was suitably despatched. I paraphrase but that's\nvirtually what some people implied at the time.\n\nThe then Archbishop of York, (John Habgood), wrote to the\nTimes as follows: -\n\nSir,\nI read with astonishment some of the letters in today's Times (July 11), the\nfirst copy I have been able to obtain since reluctantly leaving York Minster at\n5am on Monday morning after hearing the reassuring words that the fire was out…\nI feel I must point out the disturbing implications of those letters which\nsomehow seek to link the fire with some remarks made by a bishop-elect on a TV\ndiscussion programme. What kind of a god do your correspondents believe in?\nI grant that if we still lived in biblical times, and if it was customary to\ntreat thunderstorms as some kind of messengers from God, then the connection\nmight seem inevitable…\nBut to interpret the effect of a thunderstorm as a direct divine punishment\npushes us straight back into the kind of world from which the Christian Gospel\nrescued us. Is illness a divine punishment? Ought we to ask after a car crash\nwhether the car was carrying some outstanding sinner?\n\nIt's a more recent update on Jesus reference to the\nGalileans brutally executed by Pilate or the 18 killed in a freak accident when\nthe tower of Siloam fell on them, or today people killed in the Grenfell fire,\npeople with cancer, those who find themselves as refugees. Whilst we may not be\nable to explain such tragedies Jesus tells us that these people are mostly just\nlike us with sins and regrets but this isn't God punishing them, this isn't how\nGod works, he wants to forgive us, he wants to give us another chance.\n\nIt can be a natural reaction to say 'what have I\ndone to deserve this' when sadness and tragedy strikes. It's not always\npossible to immediately turn to God in strength and faith yet if we will let\nGod travel with us, show his love for us we can begin a journey where his\nforgiving love and offer of eternal salvation is evident to the point that the\nquestion 'what have I done to deserve this' shifts from a bewildered cry to one\nof thankful recognition.\n\nPaul's letter to the Corinthians includes a note of\ncaution, ' so if you think you are standing, watch out that you do not fall.'\nReally this links with the earlier need to nourish and nurture our faith. To\nunderstand the difference between accepting that we are loved and forgiven\nversus being lazy and complacent to the extent that we no longer want to foster\nthe relationship through prayer, no longer bother involving God in both our\nhappy times and our struggles, and no longer want to learn more of God's nature\nthrough scripture which has more to reveal to us than we have days on earth.\n\nIn our reading from Isaiah as we hear of God's\ninvitation to the banquet, making it clear that we don't need money to join in,\nit's free to share in wine and milk to delight ourselves in rich food. Perhaps\nsome find God's generosity to be so far from anything they have ever\nexperienced that they think it's just too good to be true, there must be some\ncatch, though not now those who attended the lunch provided this week by\nmembers of our church community. There are those who still insist on buying food\nwhen God offers a place at his table without cost where all are welcome without\nexception.\n\nIt seems that there is such a thing as a free lunch\nafter all. Again the sceptical may ask 'what have I done to deserve this' and\nfeel unworthy to accept even when it pleases God for us to do so. It's a sign\nof trust in him and his love for us.\n\nSometimes we over complicate God's invitation,\nthere's no dress code to worry about, no fiddly cutlery or awkward conversation.\nTry comparing it to the unconditional love of parents when the relationship\nwith their child is at it's best. As a hungry child when my mum would call out\n'dinners ready' I didn't try to rationalise the situation, I instinctively\nheard it as good news and came running. When you grow up in a house with 5\nkids, 2 parents and 3 dogs I also quickly worked out it was best not to hang\naround! Grown up children invited back home for a Sunday roast probably don't\nthink to themselves what's the catch, they just accept that they are loved and\nare happy to be nourished, for free, as often as possible.\n\nWhen the people told Jesus of the Galileans being\nslaughtered in the temple they didn't spare him the gory detail of how the\nblood of those killed mingled with that of sacrificial animals. Perhaps they\nhoped to rile Jesus to the extent that he would endorse some violent act of\nretribution against Pilate and his forces. Instead he reminded them of their\nown mortality and their need to accept God's love for them while they still had\ntime. In doing this he reinforced the sometimes difficult to hear truth that\ntrue change begins with us.\n\nSunday, 10 March 2019\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n then, and many now, would have expected that their lives would be much the same as the lives of those who'd gone before them. They didn't expect to have many choices. Life was precarious if you were an ordinary first century Jewish person man, living in an occupied country; it was enough just to get by, to avoid trouble, to.\n\n\n\n.\n\nThe future is up for grabs as Jesus struggles with temptation in the wilderness. That what all the \"ifs\" in it suggest..\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOut in the wilderness, Jesus asks wild questions just like these, as he struggles to choose between alternative futures, alternative visions of who he could be and what he could do. He suggests ways forward that are all about self-enrichment, self-aggrandisement, self-protection. \"If you are the Son of God… choose these\", he says to Jesus. But the God whom Jesus has grown up listening to would never call him in this direction, and Jesus knows that too well to be taken in.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nJesus was given a choice. If he was the Son of God, what would that Sonship look like? We are given a similar decision to make. If we are children of God, as God says we are, what does that mean for us, how will people know, what difference will it make, how will it shape us and the world we are part of?", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "20156a5f-7263-404e-bdbf-e8e66ca965e4", "url": "http://sealpeterandpaulsermons.blogspot.com/"}
{"text": "Men under 30 years suffer heart attacks more, claim doctors\n\nTRICHY: In a worrying find, a group of medical experts said that that young men aged under 30 are increasingly suffering from heart attacks, more than the other age groups. They said women aged below below 40 have also been suffering from heart attacks, contrary to perception. As per the statistics from January to May this year, almost 30% to 35% of those who have had treatment for heart attacks were below 45 at Apollo Speciality Hospitals in the city. And among those, 80% of them were men. Most of them were smokers. According to interventional cardiologist Dr Kader Sahib Ashraf, evrey month he has been treating at least three patients who are men below 30 years for heart attacks, this year. While smoking is the most common factor among young men suffering heart attacks, hypertension and diabetes are the other two major reasons. \"A man, who we treated for heart attack recently, was just 19. In that particular case, the patient was a smoker for almost five to six years. Among men – especially those who suffer from heart diseases at a young age – smoking is the most common reason. Everyone should be more aware about modifiable and non-modifiable risk factors when it comes to heart attack,\" Kader told TOI. While the modifiable risk factors include smoking, excessive drinking, improper diet and poor lifestyle etc., non-modifiable risk factor predominantly is family history. Cardiologists stated that people, right from when they are in their late teens, apart from not indulging in smoking or using any tobacco products, they should focus on three major practices for healthy heart: proper diet, sufficient exercise and meditation.\n\nDue to the increased prevalence of heart diseases among youngsters, doctors are urging annual body check-up for those above 30 which initially used to be for those over 40. According to chief interventional cardiologist Dr Senthilkumar Nallusamy, women, even before the post menopause, can suffer from heart attacks. \"Based on my observation, many men who are in their 20s are getting heart attacks. But everyone should be aware that even women, in their young age, can get heart attacks. There is a misconception that women, who have not had post menopause, don't get heart attacks. Most recently, I have seen three cases in which women in their 30s had heart attacks,\" he said.", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "4c99ea0e-2450-4404-bdc4-6e40179cdb8e", "url": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/trichy/men-under-30-years-suffer-heart-attacks-more-claim-doctors/articleshow/64810762.cms"}

{"text": "Menu\n\nownershipI'm going to go out on a limb here and state my belief that the world broadly splits into two groups of people:\n\nThose that always believe someone else should carry the can\n\nThose that always believe they're ultimately responsible.\n\nIn our rational minds we know that neither of these assertions is correct, some things we're responsible for, others not so much.\n\nIn my work and my life I've met a lot of the first group and they drive me to despair. As an individual that believes most of the tragedies in the world are somehow connected to a bad decision I've made in the past, I don't understand them at all. I don't understand their footloose and fancy free approach to life, I don't respect their unwillingness to share the burden and I dislike their lack of thoughtfulness.\n\nIn every single context I would rather hire, collaborate with, work with or live with the person that shares my constant assessment of responsibility. I love people who have lists, who wake up with a million things that they feel guilty about not doing, that fret and worry about not fulfilling their very best. Those that feel the responsibility of their existence on their shoulders.\n\nI admit I'm biased, I'm not trying to hide that or to shy away from my personal preference and style. In a world where too often, too many are quick to point the finger at others, are unwilling to accept the responsibility of office, of stature and of simple existence, I'm proud of this particular bias.\n\nIt is, absolutely, all about responsibility. Every step, every action, every thought we have on this mortal coil has an impact. So let's not shy away from that and accept the natural state. By doing so we shift our energy into conscious action and effort and through that we can start to make positive change.\n\nOver my career I've been able to identify the single biggest cause of employee dissatisfaction. That's been working across multiple sectors, in different roles and in different conditions.\n\nIt isn't compensation\nIt isn't development\nIt isn't promotion\n\nIt's something that is completely out of our control.\n\nIt's regret. The regret of failing to act.\n\nLife is full of events over which we have no control, life is full of changes which we cannot influence. We can sit idly by and bemoan the fact that things aren't what they were, that life has dealt us the hand that we didn't want or that people are doing things or behaving in a way in which we disapprove.\n\nWe can't change any of these things. But we can always act.\n\nUnsurprisingly, these two things are often confused. The response is, \"but I can't do anything to change [insert cause of issue]\" and the answer is always, \"so what can you do?\"\n\nUltimately we are all responsible for our happiness, we are responsible for finding our own peace and for ensuring that we make the most of our life both in and outside of work.\n\nAnd that means accepting responsibility that we can act and our failure to act, not the change, leads to our regret.\n\nIn a work context, that often means leaving a company where you're unhappy.

If you're not up to it. Get out.\n\nEvery morning when you wake up, you have a choice.\n\nLet's not become self determined victims, scared of taking responsibility for our own destiny.\n\nNobody asked you to do this job, nobody asks you to stay in it.

{"text": "the future of humanity now\n\nA blond medical or scientific researcher or doctor using looking at a clear solution in a laboratory with her Asian female colleague out of focus behind her.\n\n\"Biohacking is a fairly new practice that could lead to major changes in our life. You could it call citizen or do-it-your-self biology. It takes place in small labs — mostly non-university — where all sorts of people get together to explore biology. That could mean figuring out how the DNA in plants affects their growth, or how to manipulate genes from another source to make a plant glow in the dark.\" – Spencer Michels in PBS.org\n\nThe meaning and purpose of biohacking has changed significantly in the four years since the above words were spoken. Today, it comprises a variety of categories, including grinder biohacking (which involves technological implants or chemical manipulation of the body), DIYBio (conducting biological experiments in unconventional manners) and nutrigenomics – nutritional manipulation of bodily activities. In this post, we focus on a new study published in Scientific Reports, which shows how cold temperatures can transform the type of fat we form in our bodies and potentially helps eliminate excess fat.\n\nWhy is Brown Fat Healthier?\n\nThe body has two types of fat: white, and brown. The latter is a type of tissue that burns sugar and fat instead of storing it. Nutritional expert, Dr. Ronesh Sinha, notes that that there is a big difference between white and brown fat: while the former is inactive, the latter is a calorie burning machine that relies on glucose and triglycerides (which can cause heart disease if they are not used for energy). Traditional ways to 'hack' the body into optimal energy efficiency is to take part in regular exercise. Doing so leads to the production of irisin: a hormone what converts white fat into brown fat.\n\nSome Populations at a Higher Risk of Heart Disease\n\nAs noted by Dr. Sinha in his book The South Asian Health Solution, South Asians are at a higher risk of insulin resistance and heart disease owing to a combination of factors, which includes a lack of exercise, high stress, and a diet that is too rich in starches and unhealthy fats. He recommends the use of healthy oils such as olive oil which is ideal for the skin as well, especially when it is ozonated. He additionally recommends the use of ghee, rather than trans vegetable oils such as sunflower or corn oil. There is a further risk for South Asians: a new study by researchers at Leiden University Medical Center has found they have smaller, less active brown fatstores than their Caucasian counterparts.\n\nHow Can Human Beings Use the Cold to Build More Brown Fat?\n\nIn the above-mentioned Scientific Reports study, researchers differentiated stems cells to become fat cells at both normal body temperature and lower temperatures. They found that as the temperature became cooler, the cells formed brown fat, which causes the body to burn more calories and fat, in order to keep warm. Lead author, Virginie Sottile, said that although it has been known for some time that the cold can stimulate the formation of brown fat, \"the trigger was believed to be the body's nervous system and changes in the way we eat when we are cold. However, our study has shown that even by making fairly modest changes in temperature, we can activate our stem cells to form brown fat at a cellular level.\" In the study, a difference of only five degrees turned the stem cells into brown fat. The findings are so important because they show that the body does not need 'special cells' to produce brown fat; all it needs its the right stimulus, which can come from physical activity and colder temperatures.\n\nCold showers, iced baths, and winter swims have long been associated with better health but new research has shown that they can do more than boost circulation; indeed, they can manipulate the body into producing a crucial fat burning powerhouse: brown fat. Further research needs to be undertaken into the amount (temperature and time) of cold exposure required, but the findings are a powerful testimony to the big effects that making small lifestyle changes can have on our health.\n\nBy Guest Author Allie Cooper\n\n", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "f270cab3-b40a-4692-9f9d-f89044bee149", "url": "http://transhumanity.net/biohacking-the-body-to-produce-brown-fat/"}

{"text": "The AI Column: Time For A Moral Reckoning Down In Silicon Valley\n\nAerial view of Apple Park, the corporate headquarters of Apple Inc., located in Cupertino, California.\n\nWikimedia Commons/Daniel L. Lu\n\nThe recent revelation that China's security services had successfully compromised the servers of thousands of leading tech' firms cloud computing platforms has sent shockwaves through the tech world. The hardware hack may have compromised some of the most sensitive computer systems used by the military and intelligence services. While the scope and sophistication of the operations were alarming, it was no surprise to some in national security circles.\n\nThis reckoning was a long time coming.\n\nFor years, China has leveraged its intelligence services to engage in large-scale theft of intellectual property from firms around the world. Counter-intelligence experts say that Silicon Valley is now a prime battleground for Chinese spies and spy catchers.\n\nWhile the tech giants have grumbled, their complaints have been measured. China has the world's largest population and will soon boast of the largest economy. No multinational corporation wants to antagonize what will soon be the largest market on Earth. While cheap labor initially drew American firms there, the prospect of keeping a foothold in this market kept them there.\n\nThe emerging field of artificial intelligence may change this landscape further. China has declared that they want to lead the world AI and have made huge investments to that end. Some of their leading scientists were taught in the U.S. and many of their start-ups are funded by American venture capital.\n\nWhile the AI race has been compared to the space race of the 1960s, this competition will include private tech firms like Apple and Google, who spend more on research and development than government agencies like DARPA. Leveraging the investments made by China and getting access to their massive data troves could give these firms a critical edge. But this help comes at a price.\n\nNo firm has seen this new price more than Google. The ink was hardly dry on their new ethical statement before it revealed that they were working on a secret project to assist the Chinese government with a new search engine. China's internet is heavily censored and its government operates the most intrusive electronic surveillance regime in history.\n\nAt the same time, Human Rights Watch released a report of mass incarceration of Chinese oppression political dissidents and religious minorities. HRW estimates the government has imprisoned as many as a million people in these camps. While Google isn't building these camps, they may be helping the government decide whom to put in them.\n\nBefore the revelations about the Chinese hardware hacking, firms could tell themselves they were pursuing the best interests of their shareholders by looking the other way at China's malfeasance. Some small start-ups likely decided they might as well work in China, since someone there was going to steal their work anyway.\n\nBut the day of reckoning has arrived. These firms have to decide if they want to protect their secrets, the US government's secrets and their customers or sell them to the highest bidder. The consequence of these decisions will affect us all.\n\n\"Mal Ware\" is a veteran of the AI racket so salty that his Twitter account has been verified since 2002.

{"text": "Same-sex marriage in Baja California\n\nSame-sex marriage became legal in the Mexican state of Baja California on 3 November 2017. On that day, the State Government announced that it would cease to enforce its same-sex marriage ban and that the Civil Registry would begin accepting applications for marriage licenses by same-sex couples. This was in line with jurisprudence established by the Mexican Supreme Court, which has ruled that same-sex marriage bans are unconstitutional. Additionally, same-sex couples are allowed to adopt in the state.\n\nOn 23 August 2010, shortly after the ruling of the Mexican Supreme Court requiring all states to recognise same-sex marriages validly performed in another state, state legislators introduced an amendment to article 7 of the Constitution of the State of Baja California, adding the definition of marriage as being the union of a man and a woman. On 29 September 2010, the Congress of Baja California voted 18–1 in favor of the amendment, and after approval by municipalities, it was published on 27 May 2011.[1] On 13 November 2014, the Supreme Court of Mexico ruled that Baja California's ban on same-sex marriage was unconstitutional.[2][3]\n\nBecause the state Congress had made no efforts since 2011 to reform the Civil Code and the Constitution, a complaint was filed with the Comisión Ciudadana de Derechos Humanos del Noroeste (CCDH) on 27 November 2014.\n\nOn 14 January 2015, Raúl Ramírez Baena, director of the CCDH, filed a petition with the Governor and five municipal officers of the state requiring them to provide notification to the registrars throughout the jurisdiction on how to proceed with same-sex marriages in compliance with the Mexican Constitution.[4]\n\nOn 22 February 2017, the head of Baja California's adoption agency announced that same-sex couples have the right to adopt in the state, in line with jurisprudence established by the Supreme Court.[5]\n\nA bill was introduced in the Baja California Congress on 12 February 2015 to fully legalise same-sex marriage in the state by changing article 7 of the state Constitution.[1][6] In March 2015, politicians in Tijuana began work on an initiative to legalise same-sex marriage in the city.[7]\n\nOn 18 March 2013, a male same sex couple applied to marry in Ensenada. Their application was denied on 21 March, and they filed an amparo (injunction) on 12 April 2014.[8] On 31 October 2014, the Seventh District Court ordered the city of Ensenada to allow their marriage.[9][10] Officials in Ensenada later stated that they would abide by the injunction.[11]\n\nOn 17 June 2013, a male same-sex couple were denied the right to marry in Mexicali and applied for an injunction.[12] The injunction was approved in October 2013,[13] but was appealed by the registrar to the Supreme Court.[14] On 25 June 2014, the initial injunction was upheld and Mexico's Supreme Court deemed the state's marriage ban unconstitutional.[15] On 31 October 2014, the officer of the civil registrar of Mexicali, Adriana Guadalupe Ramirez, notified the couple that the decision would not be appealed, the refusal was withdrawn, and the marriage could proceed.[16] Though Ramirez scheduled the ceremony for 21 November 2014, when the couple appeared in the Wedding Hall to marry, the judge refused to perform the ceremony and the celebrants were evacuated after a bomb threat was received.[17][18] The Civil Registry claimed that discrepancies in documents had been rectified and announced a rescheduling of the wedding for 10 January 2015.[19] On 10 January, the couple again returned to the registry for their marriage ceremony which was declined for the fourth time, under a citizen's allegation that the couple suffers from \"insanity\". The citizen who made the allegation was an official who performs premarital counseling required by the city and who had refused to give the couple the certificate that they had completed the counseling.[20] In response to the ongoing controversy in Mexicali, officials in Tijuana announced that they were willing to comply with an amparo and offer premarital counseling to same-sex couples.[21] Lawyers for the couple filed contempt of court proceedings against the mayor and registrar for failure to carry out the instructions of the Supreme Court.[22] During a protest march scheduled by the LGBT community, officials in Mexicali announced that they were dismissing the accusation of \"madness\" and were ready to perform the marriage. On 17 January 2015, the couple became the first to marry in Baja California.[23][24] In March 2015, it was announced that the Government had asked for a review of the amparos granted in the state thus far with the intent of delaying the issuance of jurisprudence.[25]\n\nOn 6 August 2013, a lesbian couple were denied a marriage license by the civil registrar in Mexicali and filed for an injunction. They received notice of the injunction's approval on 30 December 2013.[26]\n\nOn 22 January 2015, a lesbian couple applied to marry at the Civil Registry in Tijuana and were rejected. The couple vowed to fight the denial and insisted that as federal law trumps local law, an injunction is unnecessary since the Supreme Court had already declared Baja California's same-sex marriage ban unconstitutional.[27][28]\n\nThree additional injunctions were filed in September 2014.[29] One of the three couples involved married on 14 May 2016 after their injunction was granted.[30] It was announced in June 2015 that ten people had filed for a collective amparo in Tijuana.[31] It was granted on 18 March 2016.[32] On 22 December 2016, a judge declared the state's same-sex marriage unconstitutional and granted an amparo to another same-sex couple.[33]\n\nIn September 2017, a same-sex couple successfully married in Tijuana without first receiving an amparo.[34]\n\nOn 3 November 2017, the Government of Baja California announced that it would cease to enforce its ban on same-sex marriage. It instructed the state's 5 municipalities to immediately begin issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples without requiring them to receive an injunction beforehand.[35][36][37]\n\nIn late December 2017, the State Commission of Human Rights announced that state officials cannot refuse to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples.[38] However, as of June 2019, Mexicali, the second most populous municipality in the state, is still not allowing same-sex marriage.[39]\n\nFrom 2015 to mid-2018, about 34 same-sex couples married in Baja California; 18 in Tijuana, 12 in Mexicali, 3 in Ensenada, and 1 in Tecate.[40] The Comisión Estatal de Derechos Humanos (State Commission of Human Rights) has noted that, while same-sex marriage has been legal in the state since late 2017, several same-sex couples have been denied marriage licenses. In July 2018, the Commission recorded 72 cases, mostly in Tijuana. Several couples have seen their requests denied based on the state's marriage laws, which still retain a ban on same-sex marriages.[41] The Commission has urged the State Congress to explicitly amend its marriage laws to close the loopholes, and has reminded state officials that it is illegal to refuse to issue same-sex marriage licenses.[38]\n\nBy the end of 2018, 186 same-sex couples had married in the state; a large majority of which did so in Tijuana.[42]\n\nA 2017 opinion poll conducted by Gabinete de Comunicación Estratégica found that 53% of Baja California residents supported same-sex marriage. 43% were opposed.[43]\n\nAccording to a 2018 survey by the Instituto Nacional de Estadística y Geografía (INEGI), 31% of the Baja California public opposed same-sex marriage.[44] This was the second lowest in all of Mexico, behind Mexico City at 29%.", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "7841d9b8-e932-4368-af7d-f9027e45cbb3", "url": "https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same-sex_marriage_in_Baja_California"}

{"text": "How Your Restaurant Can Successfully Use Instagram\n\nHome /\nBusiness\n\nHow Your Restaurant Can Successfully Use Instagram\n\nThe proper use of Instagram can be extremely lucrative for experiential businesses. With one billion monthly active users, the picture and video sharing platform is second to Facebook as the biggest social media network in the world. With this enormous user base and 64% of 18 to 29-year olds active on Instagram, the app presents an intriguing opportunity for businesses to create engagement with their existing audience or be discovered by a new one. This begs the question: how does a business utilize Instagram to convert followers into paying customers? The following article will provide a detailed explanation of how to increase your business's customers by crafting perfect Instagram stories, highlights, and composing Instagram posts that generate traffic.\n\nCrafting Perfect Instagram Stories\n\nInstagram stories is a powerful tool given to businesses that facilitates engaging and interacting with potential customers. A good way a restaurant in Miami can view an Instagram story is as a miniature, interactive billboard. The first way that your business can successfully utilize this feature is by including a poll slide with positive choices. This way, when someone \"votes\" on the poll they are creating a positive connection with your brand. Along with winning engagement \"points\", this tactic makes the customer feel appreciated and that their opinion matters. Aside from using a picture that evokes positive emotions in the consumer, every post should include a link that leads to an RSVP, events page, or website that will generate revenue for your business (note: including a link in an Instagram story is only available to accounts with a following of 10,000 or more). Instagram stories should be used to create a bond with your customers, gather information about your followers and generate customer interactions like RSVPs, phone calls and online purchases.\n\nHighlighting Your Instagram Stories\n\nDid you know that Instagram stories get deleted after 24 hours? It may seem that the only drawback of Instagram stories is the fact that they disappear so quickly. Instagram highlights are the solution to this drawback. This feature allows businesses to categorize and immortalize their expertly crafted Instagram story. For example, a restaurant in Miami may categorize their Instagram stories by happy hour, lunch, or Miami Heat viewing parties. This allows users to easily sift through the different categories of products and service offerings. The first thing that someone who views your profile sees is the layout. This includes the highlights section located at the top that will be a shortcut to your immortalized stories. An organized, interactive, and exciting highlight section is the best way to create a good first impression for your existing and potential customers.\n\nInstagram Posts Can Generate Traffic\n\nInstagram posts are important for a business because they are the primary vehicle that positions their brand to potential customers. These posts should include high quality and curated pictures that fully capture the experience of being at your restaurant. Instagram posts are valuable because they include a space to write engaging captions and relevant hashtags. Just like the pictures on your post, the caption should be intriguing and tailored to your customers with the goal of getting them to view your Instagram stories and click the link on the bottom of the post. This link is important for your business because it will push traffic towards an RSVP page, newsletter subscription, or event page. This traffic will translate to more purchases and ultimately an increase in revenue for your business. Hashtags are a rather extensive topic, but in short, they should be a combination of words that help potential customers find your posts.\n\nWrap Up\n\nIn conclusion, Instagram is a powerful tool that allows a business to generate valuable customer interactions and brand awareness. The 3 features that were discussed in the article are great ways to create engagement and customer relationships. Instagram stories are a great way to form a connection with an audience through interactive polls. The highlights feature allows businesses to make an impact on customers through categorization and consistency. Finally, the posts feed provides value to your business by building your brand, making it relevant with hashtags, and driving customers to in-house revenue generation points. Social media in Miami is all about connecting with an audience and showing them a good time along the way to adding them to your customer community. Any business that successfully connects with an audience and leads them to interact through Instagram is well on their way to running a successful business in Miami.", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "251bce44-8077-4ae0-93e9-4ed0c9aa01a3", "url": "https://midtownmiamimagazine.com/how-your-business-can-successfully-use-instagram/"}

With the ever shrinking player pool in this country the RFL should be begging more clubs to start up a reserve teams, not slamming the door shut on clubs who actually want to run one.\n\nNo official reason yet but my first thought was that the super league clubs (who didn't want to run reserve teams in the first place) don't fancy the extra couple of games a season against \"less worthy\" lower league opposition. If I remember correctly the last time Wigan ran a reserve team a few years back they refused to play against Keighley or Fax.\n\nDon't think anyone saw this coming, the guy was well liked and working minor miracles to make us as competitive as we have been after all that went on in the off season.

It's doable but not much room for dropped points. The next three games of Newcastle away, Oldham at home and Hunslet away could make or break our chances.\n\nA few refereeing decisions going our way, a few less mistakes in possession and we'd be talking about a huge shock at Cougar Park.

{"text": "AuthorTopic: Engine Cover Latch (Read 1337 times)\n\nHowdy! I've owned my 2010 Triton for approximately 6 months now. I'm having a blast! Still not catching fish, but I'm having a blast!! 😁\n\nMy question/concern. The engine cover latch is loose and I can't figure out how to tighten it. It's a Mercury Optimax Direct Drive 150 hp. I've downloaded a manual, which gives me everything to include the melecular make up of each bolt, but not how to fix the latch!\n\nIt's a latch in front of the cover that moves laterally. At the end of the day, it will be partially open. Any help will be appreciated.\n\nIt's probably worn or the lip it catches is. Best bet will be to replace it when it becomes too annoying. You should have three latches. As long as it's not rattling and driving you nuts or allowing the cowling to come loose some how, I wouldn't worry about it myself.\n\nThere may be a way to whom it and tighten it up?

And visiting them is easy, without the long lines and crowds of other major museums (leaving you plenty of time for the beach). Here are some highlights:\n\nRenoir Museum, Cagnes-sur-Mer\n\nPierre-Auguste Renoir, whose Impressionist paintings straddled the turn of the last century, built a house and workshop for himself in Cagnes-sur-Mer in 1907. By then an old man, Renoir would spend his last 12 years in this little village (halfway between Nice and Antibes), happily tending his fruit trees, painting in his studio, and dabbling in sculpture. Visitors see his atelier, with his easel and palette still in place (as well as his wheelchair and canes), and some original paintings (\n\nMatisse Museum, Nice\n\nHenri Matisse, the master colorist, first came to Nice in 1917, leaving behind financial struggles and a difficult marriage in Paris. He would remain in the Riviera, on and off, until his death in 1954. Though this museum's collection is slender, you'll see typical examples of his favorite motifs (flowers, fruit, female nudes) as well as his love of decorative patterns and joyful color (\n\nChagall Museum, Nice\n\nMarc Chagall settled in the Riviera after World War II. His best-known paintings feature a magical realistic style that conjures up his native Russia, with fiddlers on roofs and horses in flight. Chagall had a hand in designing this delightful museum, which includes his Biblical Message cycle: 17 large luminous canvases on biblical themes, painted in bright reds, blues, and greens that manage to combine aspects of his Russian/Jewish heritage with the Christian message (\n\nPicasso Museum, Antibes\n\nPablo Picasso, the pioneer of cubism, summered on the Riviera nearly every year from 1919 until he died in 1973 -- with the exception of World War II. But in 1946 he returned to Antibes, on the coast, where he spent a productive part of a year working in the town's landmark Château Grimaldi. Forced to improvise his materials after the shortages of the war years, but elated by the newfound peace (and a new girlfriend), Picasso produced an amazing volume of celebratory, colorful artworks. The compact museum now housed in the Grimaldi offers a manageable look at the paintings and sketches Picasso made there (\n\nWith Halloween and All Souls' Day approaching, I'd like to spook you with some of my favorite European cemeteries and crypts.

It is sung by Lauretta after tensions between her father Schicchi and the family of Rinuccio, the boy she loves, have reached a breaking point that threatens to separate her from Rinuccio. Here are some suggestions from PianoVoiceOpera staff on how to approach better the study of this aria. Continue Reading...\n\nMore...\n\nO mio babbino caro - Interpretation Tips\n\nWhile singing this aria, remember that it belongs to a comic opera and none of what you say could be true! But if you think that Lauretta is trying to convince her father to do what she wants, bringing up serious argumentations, knowing that she can manipulate her father Schicchi as she wants, your expressiveness will definitely become more sympathetic and interesting. Actually you are playing the role (Lauretta) of a capricious girl, as is clear in the quartet where Lauretta does nothing but repeat \"Dad, Dad I want it...\" as she is asking for a toy.\n\nO mio babbino caro - Tech Tips\n\nFrom a technical point of view, the aria you are facing is not complex. Well, I have 2 simple tips for you:\n\nDo not sing it with a too slow Tempo, this is not Vissi d'Arte! A lively Tempo will make this aria much smooth and bright.\n\nSet your mind ready for the high notes before the Ab, then do the same while you're singing the high notes. This will avoid the unnecessary Portamento and will help you not to tight these high notes. Often, when studying this aria, young singers aren't yet ready for high notes. If you are not a high-notes expert soprano, pay attention not to tight the notes on the octave jump.\n\nO mio babbino caro - Focusing on:\n\n70%\n\nBreath Management\n\n0%\n\nAgility\n\n80%\n\nLegato\n\nO mio babbino caro - Learning files and tracks\n\nO mio babbino caro - Listening Suggestions\n\nWe believe that listening to great singers is always the best way to improve your technique and style. do not try to do what they do while singing (each of us is unique and unrepeatable and what is good for the great singers may not work well for you!), just listen to the sound and try to reproduce it with your voice!

{"text": "Always Tired? 12 Ways Wellness Experts Combat Exhaustion\n\nA whopping seven out of 10 Americans report feeling tired at work on a regular basis. And those double-shot lattes aren't always cutting it. Tiredness can strike anyone, at any time, anywhere — including the wellness experts we profiled for this piece. The good news? A variety of strategies can help you fight back against exhaustion every day of the week. Here's how to make it happen.\n\n12 Expert Tips to Fight Exhaustion, Starting Now\n\n1. Get nourished.\n\nProper nutrition is essential for maintaining the energy you need to get through the day, says Kristina Carrillo-Bucaram, founder of Fully Raw. \"I always make sure I am properly nourished,\" she says. \"And by 'nourished,' I mean making sure my diet is rich in raw fruits and veggies. Water in the morning, smoothie for breakfast, fruit bowl for lunch, and giant salads for dinner. When my body is nourished well, it can function properly and I feel light on my feet and motivated to conquer anything.\"\n\n2. Power up with plants.\n\nKaren Urbanek, founder of Karen's Holistic Health, makes no bones about where she gets her energy. \"I eat it! Minerals — the sparks of life — all come from plants. Vitamins, phytonutrients and bio-photons come from plants,\" she says. \"And all proteins (amino acids) come from plants! Yes, you heard that right: Animals eat plants or plant-eating animals to get them! So of course if I want energy, I eat plants!\"\n\n3. Black out your coffee — and your curtains.\n\nHealth experts will repeat it until they're blue in the face: Sustained energy doesn't happen without quality sleep. \"Sleep is incredibly important to me so that I wake up feeling refreshed,\" says Dave Asprey, Founder and CEO of Bulletproof Coffee, who also starts his day with the signature brew to boost energy and brain function. Asprey suggests investing in blackout curtains to keep out all light, and putting black tape over small lights on electronics. \"Melatonin is produced at night, in the dark, to regulate our sleep. Artificial light can disrupt melatonin production. If you're on a budget, you can cover your windows with foil paper to eliminate light,\" he says. \"In my room, everything that blinks or glows is covered with black tape or TrueDark filtering dots. I also turn my phone on airplane mode and leave it on airplane mode until I'm ready to start my work day.\"\n\n4. Nap if you need to.\n\nIf your weren't able to get a good night's sleep in spite of your best intentions, then you can help make up for the deficit (and enjoy an energy boost) with a quick power nap, says Wendy Bazilian, Dr.PH, RD, author of Eat Clean, Stay Lean: The Diet, and owner of Bazilian's Health in San Diego. \"These brief interludes allow the brain and [body] chemistry to reset and become reinvigorated,\" she says. The trick is to keep the nap to about 20 minutes — longer than that, and you might actually increase your grogginess whenever you get up. For more pro napping tips, head here.\n\n5. Stock grab-and-go greens.\n\n\"One of the main reasons most people's energy will drop, especially in the afternoon, is low blood sugar, says Brett Hoebel, author of The 20-Minute Body and a personal trainer perhaps best known for his work on The Biggest Loser. \"Instead of reaching for coffee, which actually drops your blood sugar even more, I always have a powdered greens drink on hand,\" Hoebel says. \"It delivers a ton of nutrition in one serving and balances my blood sugar immediately. It's quick, convenient [and] effective, and I don't get slowed down from eating solid food.\"\n\n6. Bag 200-calorie snacks.\n\nStill feeling famished? Joy Bauer, MS, RDN, health and nutrition expert for NBC's TODAY show, author of From Junk Food to Joy Foodand founder of Nourish Snacks, says, \"toting one to two strategic snacks in my bag is key. My criteria? Snacks must be no more than 200 calories and comprised of wholesome ingredients. Also, they have to be super-delicious to satisfy cravings and make me feel happy! I'm a big fan of almonds, pistachios, pumpkin seeds, Greek yogurt with fruit, hummus with veggie sticks, nut butter and crackers, [and] light popcorn. And of course, I never leave home without a few packages of my Nourish Snacks — shameless plug but the truth!\"\n\n7. Hydrate like you mean it.\n\n\"When I'm tired, I revaluate how much water I've had to drink during the day,\" says Maxine Yeung, MS, RD, CPT, CWC, and founder of The Wellness Whisk. \"Even just a one-to-three-percent loss of body fluid can start making you feel tired and less able to concentrate.\" Can't stand the thought of drinking another glass of plain water? Yeung recommends shaking things up with a cup of mint tea. \"Mint's aromatic flavor is bold and pops with each sip, while the menthol adds a cooling effect to help perk you up when you're feeling sleepy,\" she says. \"Some studies suggest that peppermint may also help with alertness and concentration.\"\n\n8. Just add fizz.\n\nYou can also opt for something bubbly if that makes you more inclined to drink up, says Keri Gans, RDN, Nutritionist, Certified Yoga Teacher, and author of The Small Change Diet. Sadly, she's not talking about champagne. For a work-appropriate beverage, Gans recommends mixing seltzer with a small splash of orange juice.\n\n9. Get a move on.\n\n\"I am a new mom, so #teamnosleep is a real thing. Being exhausted has taken on a whole new meaning,\" says Katie Kendall, CPT, CES, and Trainer at BRICK New York. One of Kendall's go-to strategies for staying alert is to get moving. \"When I'm feeling tired, I work out earlier in the day to get those endorphins pumping first thing,\" she says.\n\nCan't squeeze in a whole workout? No problem. \"Twenty to 60 seconds of jumping jacks or jump rope is all it takes to invigorate the entire body,\" says Bazilian. \"The quick exercise helps stretch the torso, increase blood flow… and bring instant energy to the body.\"\n\n10. Try this \"one weird trick.\" (Actually, there are two.)\n\nFounder of Going Zero Waste Kathryn Kellogg is no stranger to exhaustion. \"I have a regular job, I blog, and I'm also an actor,\" she says. \"Being a performer is all about energy. You've got to have it, and relying on caffeine is not an option, at least not for me.\" So how does Kellogg pump up her energy levels fast? With this funky exercise:\n\nHold your hands near your face and squeeze them into a fist.\n\nScrunch up your face while squeezing your hands tight. The goal is to make your fists and face small and tight.\n\nHold this scrunched position for about five seconds.\n\nAfter five seconds, let your face and your fists explode as large as possible while saying \"Pah!\" on the breath.\n\nRepeat this process three times for an instant jolt of energy.\n\nWhile we're on the topic of unusual energizing tricks, Bazilian has another good one. Keep spoons in the freezer and retrieve them if you're feeling fatigued. \"I apply them to my eyes, wrapping [them] with a soft tissue before applying to the eyelids. [This is] to both reduce puffiness and also bring a quick 'awake' look and feeling,\" she says. \"You can also place them at the base of the neck [or] skull to wake you up and reduce any bit of naggy headache from neck or eye strain. This is a lifesaver, and it really gives me a quick 'jolt' of energy.\"\n\n11. Take a page from the biohacking playbook.\n\nBiohacking is all about strategically providing your body with different inputs so as to optimize its functioning. If that sounds complicated, it's actually not — just take notes from Michelle Pellizzon, a health and wellness coach and founder of Better By Michelle. \"I always start my day with Bulletproof Coffee, which gives me solid energy until lunch,\" she says. \"If I'm really dragging later in the day, whipping up a little adaptogenic almond milk helps. I add ½ teaspoon of rhodiola, ½ teaspoon of cordyceps, and a pinch of cinnamon to eight ounces of almond milk and sip!\"\n\n12. Give yourself some space.\n\nRather than beating yourself up for feeling exhausted, be gentle. \"Make time to rest and restore from all the work that you do during the day,\" says Urbanek. You might try a formal meditation or simply give yourself the time to enjoy 10 deep breaths.\n\nDon't feel guilty if you need more of these breaks than usual on the days you're feeling fatigued. \"There is so much more strength in pacing and having intermittent sessions of energy expended and [then] energy replenished,\" says Bazilian. \"Think about holding up a glass of water with your arm. That glass may not be very heavy, but if you held it without even a single break, your arm muscles would fatigue to the point where you couldn't hold it any longer. Alternately, if you hold it up for a bit, take a little break, and then lift it again, it's likely that you could continue that for as long as you cared to… perhaps indefinitely.\"", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "c99b3054-a32c-4f03-bbe0-fe46e9e5025e", "url": "http://dailyburn.com/life/lifestyle/always-tired-exhaustion-tips/"}
{"text": "Child and Adolescent Psychiatrist, Dr Amit Sen has called on local journalists to be responsible when covering issues of child abuse.\n\nDr Sen has more than 20 years of experience as a child psychiatrist in India and Britain. He is currently the director for Child First Mental Health Institute in New Delhi, India.\n\nDr Sen was one of the top facilitators at the Rights of the Child and the Criminal Justice System workshop held at the Suva Holiday Inn over the past two days.\n\nHe said that every journalist especially court journalists needed to consider the child confidentiality when covering any story on child abuse. Dr Sen said they should also take into consideration the impact of naming and shaming the accused of a child abuse offense.\n\nHe said that naming and shaming the accused could give an idea to the society of the victim as Fiji was a small country.\n\nDr Sen said court journalists should be responsible and consider the trauma the article they produce would have on the victim.\n\nHe said journalists should also focus on reporting beyond what happened in court and start focusing on the areas of failures within the system when dealing with such issues. On Monday, Media Industry Development Authority's chairperson Ashwin Raj said it was vital that the media had a clear understanding on the Convention on the Right of a Child in order to properly report on child issues.\n\nThe United Nations Human Rights Officer, Marcelo Daher, said the protection of children from violence was serious concern for everyone and it was unacceptable.\n\n\"Protecting people from any act of violence was the main concern for every human rights treaty,\" he said.\n\n\"Violence against children was invisible across boundaries and it was widespread. Aa child could suffer violence for a long period and no one would do anything.\"\n\nMr Daher reminded journalists that when dealing with issues of child abuse they should deal with it responsibly and take into account the development of the child.", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "553f9430-dcb2-48e1-a6bd-c100547ee2f8", "url": "https://fijisun.com.fj/2017/04/12/be-mindful-when-writing-on-child-abuse-cases-journalists-told/"}

{"text": "Antwerp artist and brilliant market thinker\n\nMicha Leeflang carried out an extensive study into the work of Joos van Cleve. She focused on three aspects of the work of this early sixteenth-century artist from Antwerp: how did he produce his paintings, who purchased them and how were they distributed\" For example, she investigated how he organised his studio, to what extent he and his assistants painted to commission and which marketing strategies he developed to bring his work to the attention of the public.\n\nOf the more than 300 paintings known to originate from Van Cleve, the researcher studied 107 with infrared reflectography. In addition 50 paintings were dated with dendrochronology, for which the annual rings of the wooden panel on which the scene is painted are used as a time indication. By doing this she could, for example, attribute some of Van Cleve's paintings to two of his students, one of whom was his son. She also established that the quality of the paintings made in his studio was fairly constant. From this the art historian concluded that Van Cleve probably employed a permanent group of assistants to safeguard the quality, which enabled him to distinguish himself from other workshops.\n\nMarketing strategy\nJoos van Cleve appeared to have focused on the national and international free markets and on acquiring important commissions. This spread of activities over several markets yielded him considerable success. Moreover, he distinguished himself by producing only works of a professional perfection and very high quality. This was a very different approach from the vast majority of other early sixteenth-century artists from Antwerp. Further the painter had important clients such as King Francis I of France and for his time he had a large studio. All of this enhanced his status as an artist, thus enabling him to acquire many new commissions.\n\nLeeflang discovered that Van Cleve often made the rough sketch, the so-called underdrawing, and he sometimes indicated colours in the stage of the underdrawing as a guideline for his workshop assistants. These assistants subsequently completed the paintings under the supervision of their master. Using infrared reflectography Leeflang could also establish which elements were later added to the paintings or changed, probably at the behest of the client. For example, on the triptych with The Crucifixion in Naples (Museo di Capodimonte) a third son appeared that cannot be seen in the initial sketch and is only visible on the top layer of paint in the painting.\n\n###\n\nThis doctoral research was part of the NWO project 'Antwerp Painting before Iconoclasm: a socio-economic approach'. The purpose of this study was to map how changes in studio practices, the market and the behaviour of clients affected medieval art in Antwerp.\n\nDisclaimer: AAAS and EurekAlert! are not responsible for the accuracy of news releases posted to EurekAlert! by contributing institutions or for the use of any information through the EurekAlert system.", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "98324da2-f6f9-4079-a35b-ede6e6e8d7d7", "url": "https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2007-09/nofs-aaa092507.php"}

{"text": "May I respectfully point out that contemporary evolutionary theory has expanded way beyond its original concept of chance happenings.\n\nCurrently, the evolution model is used to determine the source of humanity which at this point only refers to human's anatomy due to the limitations of natural science. This material/physical approach to you and me intersects with the Catholic doctrine that our human nature, as created by God, unites both the material and the spiritual worlds. It is because of its God-created spiritual soul that the body made of matter becomes a living human person.\n(Source: Catechism of the Catholic Church, Second Edition, paragraphs 355 - 421, including footnotes)\n\nEach one of us is called by our Creator to share eternally in His own life. What guarantees this truth is that all of us are descended from one person who is referred to as the living Adam. And how do we know this? We accept the fact that God blest the two sole founders of humanity so that they could be fertile and multiply. (Genesis 1: 27-28) Because of the unity of the human species which is founded in one couple, you and I are assured that we are included in the Salvific Mission of Jesus Christ. (Romans, chapter five)\n\nIn other words, Catholics can be evolutionists when it comes to the material/physical world with its animals and plants, etc. But when it comes to the human person, Catholics cannot accept the claim that we slowly descended from 1,000 to 10,000 breeding pairs which is what current evolution theory is proposing.", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "6b60d73e-eef3-4db0-9cff-8ec3d191a86e", "url": "https://forums.catholic.com/t/catholic-position-on-evolution/285741"}
{"text": "anyone ever tried real organic hydroponics?\n\nGo to page\n\nGo to page\n\nLiving dead girl\n\nHave you kept crawdaddies before? Their territoriality seems to present other aquaponics people with problems unless they've got a nice big pond. They take small fish, too.\n\nI told one of my sisters about how we pop the claws off in the trade the other day and OHMYGOD, she was horrified. It cracked me up because in real life she's a fuckin' merciless whack bitch. But not when it comes to crawdaddies, apparently.\n\nGrowRU\n\nWanted to share what I have learned about aquaponics, and also some information on a hybrid system.\n\nLots of edible plants seem to do much better than cannabis in a aquaponics setup. Top 2 issues are ph and nutrients. Some fish are not tolerant of p. Few folks are experimenting with fish that tolerate higher p. In order to try and get a higher yielding aquaponic setup with mmj.\n\nCannabis prefers a lower ph range, aquaponics and the fish prefer a higher ph range. This can also depend on the type of your fish.\n\nThen potentially the plants do not get sufficient levels of food and then the yield is lacking.\n\n2 solutions that are being tested.\nYou got your fish tank and some rafts for your plants. Farmers have found a few approaches to increase production and still use the fish solution for feeding.\nBiochar wicking beds, (compost + biochar) then are watered with the aquaponic solution. This is proving to work well.\n\nAnother farmer uses a rdwc type of setup with fish. He uses a large net pot for the plant. Before placing in the system he calculated the amount of water to saturate the crown without runoff. He allows the system to establish itself. Then he does crown feeds with low ec salts. The roots grow into the water and absorb but organic and inorganic nutrients. Keeping the salts out of the res keep the biology in check. Then he can get p inputs from 4 sources. 2 organic and 2 synthetic.\n\nOne cool thing was a dead fish.\nOne setup had a dead fish and algae growing in it. The fish started to decompose and the cycle continued. The system was attached to a pond in the backyard and then went indoors to feed the plants then back out to a fish tank. The system was jump started using a compost tea extract. Then the fish were never fed and the natural cycle was allows to do its thing. Basically a mini eco system.\n\nThink about nature. Think about humans. Who does it better? I you can combine indoors and outdoors or go entirely outdoors. Then you you have any the energy (food) you need. A self sustained system. Even a dead fish can provide food to the \"system\".\n\nSo now that you got the basics of that concept.\n\nThink differently. There is a system in place that works and works very well.\n\nIf you have a fresh water fish tank, partial water changes are done to help clean the fish. Nature does not do partial water changes on lakes and oceans. So, what happens to the waste of fish and decomposed animals? They are eaten by bacterium generally creating ammonia. The nitrogen cycle.\n\nIn established aquariums, just as in nature, toxic ammonia from fish waste is broken down by bacteria into nitrite, which is itself broken down by a different group of bacteria into nitrate. In a newly set up aquarium, those bacteria are not present in any quantity, and it takes time – about a 4 to 6 weeks under normal circumstances – for those bacteria to multiply to the point of being able to keep up with the waste output of the fish. \"New Tank Syndrome\" and \"The Break-In Cycle\" describe the period in which ammonia and then nitrite levels rise to dangerous quantities before being converted into relatively harmless nitrate.\n\nBelow is a diagram of the nitrogen cycle. Energy enters into the top of the system through Algae. There are two places where the energy exits. It exits through composting and fish. Energy is also consumed by the bacteria to keep them running.\n\nSee how the system can be designed to be self sustainable? Pond, fish tank, and garden. The fish cannot be fed. They need to live on their own without supplemental food. The energy for the fish food comes directly from the sun. This means the eco-cycle is established and the system works like a lake. You can expedite the start up the whole cycle by adding a compost extraction with the highest amounts of bacteria and protozoan.\n\nCall it cycling, nitrification, biological cycle, start-up cycle, break-in cycle, or the nitrogen cycle. They are all the same thing. Water coming out of the tap does not normally contain all of the elements, microbiology and ecosystems to sustain fish. They has to be established for the fish to live.\n\nI wanted to share, in hopes that it will help you to design a system that saves you $$ and is also the most effective.Living dead girlbckwht, are any of these GH grows putting out flowering plants that are true quality? We have an organic hydroponic tomato producer upcountry from us, and their tomatoes taste like shit. I hate saying it, but it's true, I feel gypped every time we pay for them and get them home, only to taste crap. I'd rather eat a canned tomato--truth.\n\nThe coldwater fishes have much higher DO (dissolved oxygen) requirements. If you can meet that (water movement with lots of surface turbulence, and venturis), then you should be able to grow them. If you go with the peacock bass from South America it can handle much warmer water temps and concurrent lower DO levels.\n\nWhat he is trying to do also needs a lot of turbulence air and venturis... the bacteria that lives in the filter media needs it otherwise his soup will become anaerobic and kill his soil...\n\nI am testing the hydrosoil concept (no hole pot, airstone, aquarium air pump, organic soil, water saturation) and even thou it is too early to have a veredict, the test subjects show survival probabilities after a difficult start (which was entirely my fault)\n\nIt's definitely doable, but will require frequent maintenance/cleaning/flushing to eliminate as much organic residue from building up as possible. Your NFT system is probably your best bet due to the constant flow of nutrients. Might want to consider some 120 mesh/micron in-line filters somewhere in there to keep it all running smoothly\n\nI have done bioponics quite a bit. It is like hydroponic Korean Natural Farming. Warning- it stinks like baby diapers. Your bioponic system is best utilized outdoors.\n\nFirst, I make a nutrient slurry in a 5 gallon bucket. The base is always a scoop of compost for the humus and micros. I add LAB's, or sewer enzymes like Rid-X or Bio-Clean. I suppose you could use leaf mold if you want your inputs to be local. I fill the bucket about half way with inputs. For veg, I use N dominant sources like green grass or comfrey. For transition, I like to boost the calcium with egg or oyster shells. For flower, I'll throw in things like apple cores, grape pomace, and banana peels. It is bubbled for a few days as the enzymes break it down. Pewzus, it stinks.\n\nIt is filtered with a paint strainer and added to your nutrient solution until you get about 1.0 EC, usually 30-60 ml/gallon. It is extremely bio-active, so just be sure to use a coarse plastic sponge as a bio filter and keep your pump clean. When the EC is low, add more nutes. When the EC is high, add more water. There is no worry about pH as the bacteria keep everything available to the plant.", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "0fdbd90b-e3ea-4f6d-bbb1-4b81c3351096", "url": "https://www.thcfarmer.com/threads/anyone-ever-tried-real-organic-hydroponics.50892/page-10"}
{"text": "I meant to post yesterday on Independence Day but didn't get a chance to organize my thoughts and write a post. On our country's 234th birthday, I look at our country as one at a crossroads. I'm not sure the Founding Fathers would recognize the country they see today. They believed in freedom, the Judeo-Christian ethic, and limited government. Today, we see people who are conditioned to be dependent on government, moral relativism, and a bloated, out-of-touch government at all levels.\n\nFreedom vs. Dependence\n\nOur country's founders wanted to be free. The signers of the Declaration of Independence mutually pledged their lives, fortunes, and sacred honor to the principle that all are are created equal and endowed by our Creator to the right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. The Founders developed our founding documents on this deep desire to be free.\n\nToday, we appear to be moving toward a desire for security and dependence as a nation. Our companies spend so much money lobbying for favors and advantage from the federal government. Many people desire womb-to-tomb social programs that remove responsibility for their personal well-being. I favor a sensible safety net provided by government and not-for-profits that provide long-term help to those least able to take care of themselves and temporary help to people who need short-term assistance to get through a particular situation.\n\nThe founders believed that free people left alone to pursue their personal dreams and desires would provide personally without a government who robs Peter to pay Paul.\n\nThe Judeo-Christian Ethic vs. Moral Relativism\n\nThe founders believed in a moral ethic based on Judeo-Christian values. The Great Commandment and the Golden Rule can sum up how our country's founders thought how people should deal with one another. Actions viewed through the prism of these two Judeo-Christian precepts would identify which course was the right thing to do.\n\nToday, we live in a culture that champions the idea that morality is a personal choice. This mindset espoused by many academics results in a society where the moral fabric unravels and \"the ends justify the means.\"\n\nOur founders believed that Judeo-Christian values would provide order to a nation based on freedom and personal responsibility.\n\nLimited vs. Out-of-Control Government\n\nThe founders believed that limited government \"of the people, by the people and for the people\" governs best. The Bill of Rights was one of the first documents to put limits on the government as opposed to the governed. They believed that the federal government should only perform the functions that the states could not perform individually. The primary function of the federal government was to protect the citizenry from enemies both foreign and domestic. The secondary function was to make sure that the playing field was level and everyone played by the same set of rules.\n\nToday, we have out-of-control government at all levels local, state and, especially, federal. Bloated employee rolls protected by government workers' unions at the local and state levels are crippling local and state budgets especially in today's economic environment. Unfunded mandates passed by the federal government are bringing state governments to their needs. Out-of-touch politicians on both sides of the aisle in Washington spend our money to buy votes. Bureaucracies at all levels regulate the activities of businesses and individuals to make it difficult to enjoy our right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.\n\nThe founders would see government as currently implemented here and say this was never what they had in mind when developing our founding documents. Their minds and support would be with today's \"Tea Party\" movement and its desire to get back to basic American principles and values.\n\nWhat Can We Do\n\nMany people question whether we are too late to get the horse back in the barn. Most representative republics throughout history have lasted about 200 years before devolving into tyranny. President Lincoln referred to America as the \"last best hope on earth,\" and President Reagan referred to America as a \"shining city on a hill.\" I don't think it's too late to save our country from itself, but we all must act quickly.\n\n1) We must get back to our founding principles\n\nWe may see the founders as rich, white men wearing wigs, but these men had a vision of a country based on individual rights given by God not men. Freedom, personal responsibility and limited government have worked for America and can work again.\n\n2) We need to clean house across all elective offices in government\n\nThe mindset that \"he's a bum, but he's my bum\" needs to be turned out. As citizens, we need to demand that all of our elective leaders work for us and to hold them accountable when they don't. The founders never intended politics to become a profession. Many of the people in elective office today have never made a payroll or provided a product or a service valuable to our fellow man. We need to identify candidates from either party who agree with our founding principles and hold them accountable from election to election.\n\n3) We must rein in the bureaucracy\n\nIf we elect people who agree with founding principles but don't handle the bureaucracy, we will never be able to get back to constitutional government. Now is not the time for a scalpel when dealing with the size and scope of government. Our elective leaders must identify and eliminate full departments of government bureaucracies.\n\nIn Conclusion\n\nI love our country, its values, our history, and its diverse population. If we lose this country's values and principles, I'm afraid that we will see another era in human history similar to the Dark Ages.\n\nI hope everyone had a great 4th.

It was also said Trump had disregarded US allies and friends in Syria. In truth, the decision was well-mulled over by US decision makers. Far more factors were part of the decision than the short-list reported in the US news media.\n\nThere was a storm of disagreement, and in some foreign policy circles in Washington, outrage, following the decision by US President Donald Trump to withdraw US forces from Syria. Fault with the decision was supported by the claim that Trump was acting against the best advice of his top military commanders and other foreign and national security officials. It was also said that Trump was displaying a certain insouciance toward allies and friends on the ground in Syria, to include Kurdish Forces (the People's Protection Units or YPG) and the Syrian Democratic Forces (Arab and Assyrian fighters, as well high numbers of YPG units). Additionally, it was widely surmised that Trump reached the decision to withdraw US troops from thin air, and hastily announced the decision at the end of 2018 in order to \"check off\" a campaign promise. Some news media commentators even went as far as to claim that the decision signalled a new US isolationism and the beginning of a contraction under which certain US interests worldwide would be abandoned. In truth, the decision was thoroughly mulled over in a decision making meeting prior to being announced. Moreover, far more factors, in particular factors that tied to reality, were part of the decision, than the short-list reported in the news media. The aim here is to enumerate and examine, from an out of the box perspective, some of the likely considerations made by Trump and his aides and advisers prior to making the Syria decision public. Hopefully, the examination here will contribute in some way to the policy debate in the US on Syria.\n\nThe Syria situation was not a problem of Trump's making. US President Barack Obama and other national leaders poorly interpreted information concerning an opposition movement that had organised against the regime of Syria Arab Republic President Bashar Al-Assad in March 2011. They believed that opposition movement made Assad regime ripe for change, however, opportunity was seen by Obama and his foreign and national security policy decision makers where there was none. The conclusion was that with a modicum support for the right opposition groups, the Assad regime would face collapse and be forced to the negotiation table, where Assad, himself, would agree to an orderly and immediate transition of power. Among a long list of negative consequences that have resulted from that policy approach have been: a seemingly never ending civil war in which millions of civilians have become casualties, millions more have been displaced, Russia and other countries who are potential adversaries of the US have strengthened their presence in Syria and increased their influence on the Assad regime; and, extraordinarily dangerous terrorist groups such as Al-Qaeda and ISIS, have established strongholds. Along with the US, European and Middle Eastern countries, have invested troops and other resources in Syria in what has been a successful effort to destroy terrorist groups in particular.\n\nThe contradiction between the desire to continue the fight alongside allies and friends, (that resulted in what now appear to have been ill-advised promises by US officials that the US would remain in Syria), and the requirements of force protection and the need to respond to rapidly evolving geostrategic realities in the region, made the decision to withdraw undoubtedly agonizing. Trump, however, was not marginal about the matter. Some of Trump's top advisers were very disappointed over where the final decision fell. A couple top officials, having determined that continuing to work in support of Trump's choice would compromise their personal values, their consciences, resigned. Perhaps an effort to keep US allies and friends invested in Syria militarily or otherwise of the decision to withdraw, even in camera, was a missing step. However, the decision will not be judged right or wrong here. Homines enim cum rem destruere non possunt, iactationem eius incessunt. Ita si silenda feceris, factum ipsum, si laudanda non sileas, ipse culparis. (Such is the disposition of mankind, if they cannot blast an action, they will censure the parade of it; and whether you do what does not deserve to be taken notice of, or take notice yourself of what does, either way you incur reproach.)\n\nThe announced withdrawal of US military units from Syria came as a surprise when Trump first made it on Twitter and then with a public statement on the White House lawn. There was an immediate rush by critics and detractors of Trump to pure negatives on the decision such as calling it an abandonment of allies and friends in the field. Other observers, uncertain about the future of Syria and uncertain of the future course of the US in the region, joined in the chorus against the decision. As promises were made by US officials other than Trump to stand alongside and support allies and friends, did as much to convince many observers that the US commitment to Syria was essentially open-ended, the disappointment and harsh reactions were stronger when that belief was dashed. Yet, with an assessment made that the main mission of destroying ISIS and other terrorist groups in Syria, and correlatively degrading their ability to act elsewhere, reaching toward its terminus, keeping US forces in the combat zones of Syria, keeping them in harm's way, became questionable to Trump. All along, it was a calculated risk to deploy and allow US forces to operate in Syria. Having spent months crossing his fingers concerning the well-being of US troops there, Trump made the decision to withdraw. Although US troops, themselves, expect to be in harm's way whenever they are deployed in combat zones overseas, value judgments must be made by the civilian leadership on the returns or benefits from such dangerous deployments. It would seem Trump determined that the return on the US investment of troops in Syria, no longer justified placing their lives at risk. In making this decision, Trump likely felt some satisfaction knowing that he has robbed potential adversaries of the freedom to include an attack on US forces in Syria in their calculus of how they might hurt the US in the region.\n\nUS troops deployed in Syria are among the best trained in the US armed forces. As expected, they accomplished a tremendous amount. Yet, although extremely effectual in their performance, the size of their deployment, 2600 troops, is lean relative to those deployed in Operation Inherent Resolve in Iraq, Operation Freedom's Sentinel in Afghanistan, Operation Iraqi Freedom in Iraq, or Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan. Their numbers are also meager relative to the presence of potential adversaries in Syria. Expectations from those troops should not be placed too high. For those rightfully concerned with worldwide impressions of Trump's decision to withdraw US forces, there should be an awareness that the force of 2600 troops was too few to do too much on the ground anyway. Change in Syria in the interest of the US and in a way that reflects US values would mean: allowing for the return of refugees and displaced persons; the establishment of transparent democratic governance in some form at the local, provincial, and national levels in Syria; providing all people of Syria with residences, more than just temporary shelters; an adequate, regular supply of sustenance; a means to sustain the delivery of sustenance; sufficient sources of potable water; continuous power and electricity; a highway and road systems that will allow for freedom of movement; reconstruction bridges, tunnels, airports, harbors, dams, parks, and waterways; schools for children; hospitals and health clinics; sanitation system; law enforcement at the local, provincial, and national level; a courts system; effectual employment bureaus, a secure banking system; the rebuilding of factories and other workplaces; an agribusiness development program; and, a multitude of other necessities that will support the development of a viable society. Given the size of the force, it would not be able to guarantee the top five items enumerated on this list, particularly the safety and security of Syrian returnees from the Assad regime and other potential adversaries. The Assad regime would invariably want all returnees to fold neatly under its cruel subjugation. There would also be the requirement of protecting the Syrian people from Islamic militant groups seeking to reestablish their Caliphate or some new Islamic State from which they could launch terrorist attacks globally.\n\nThere is a broader picture concerning US capabilities and capacity to conduct military-style operations. Wars can be fought even when formations of US troops are not present. Other less visible ways and means to support the Kurdish Forces and Syrian Democratic Forces can be provided by elements of the US intelligence community to include the Central Intelligence Agency (\"CIA\") and the Defense Intelligence Agency (\"DIA\"). Invariably, some US troops could be used covertly, in specialized technical role for those agencies. By integrating themselves among local military units, they can provide assistance in the form of supply, training, and guidance to local senior leaders, support special reconnaissance, aid local commanders with command and control of units, and engage in direct action when required. A few historical examples of the success of such operations include: CIA operations in Military Region 3 in South Vietnam; the employment of Special Forces Operational Detachments in Operation Desert Storm in Kuwait; operations in support of the Army of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Croatian Defense Council during both Operation Sana and Operation Oluja during Bosnia War; and, CIA and DIA operations in Afghanistan during Operation Enduring Freedom. Arguably, engaging in a covert operation with paramilitary trained case officers, special activities operators, and special forces soldiers working in tandem with local troops may not be as effective as having US military units perform tasks, but it is a viable option when the decision has been made to no longer make formal use of the US military. On the particular matter of providing forward control for airstrikes to defend allies and friends against attacks, resources would exist among operatives of those agencies on ground to perform that task. Moreover, with concentrations of US troops no longer on the ground in Syria, US air assets and the US-led anti-ISIS Coalition, while still maintaining parameters for safety for allies and friends, could pursue ground targets more vigorously with less concern that retribution from a malign actor against US troops would be possible. That retribution could take the form of a surprise military attack or an act of terrorism.\n\nMany of the immediate impressions expressed about Trump's decision to withdraw US troops from Syria ignored certain realities of the evolving situation in the Middle East. There is a broader picture of foreign and national security policy for the US and other countries in the region of which US troops deployed to Syria had become a part. To understand that bigger picture, one only needs to listen closely to the persistent anti-US grumblings voiced from the capitals of potential adversaries within the region. National leaders and other top officials of those countries insist more directly that they have the will and inclination to assert themselves in Syria. In addition to those grumblings are tests of missiles of considerable range and latent warnings concerning the reinitiation of an ostensibly dormant nuclear weapons program. Perhaps through miscalculation, they might decide to act against US forces not simply to destroy them, but rather as a means to force them out. Fresh in the minds of many in the region are the 1983 attack on the US Marine Barracks in Beirut, Lebanon and the 1996 attack on US troops at the Khobar Towers complex in Dhahran, Saudi Arabia, and the responses by the US. Perhaps a few US political leader, though surely well-meaning, have forgotten that the enemy will have a say in the outcome of the best laid plans of Washington. (With all of the \"what ifs\" considered, force security has been optimized through the employment of a suite of tactics, techniques, procedures, and methods by US force commanders in Syria. Yet, only the clairvoyants can walk with an assured step in the opaqueness of the Levant. There, one must always expect the unexpected.) Lessons learned from past US military deployments to support allies in the region, which were also relatively limited in scope, have undoubtedly left Trump determined to avoid the disasters that US Presidents have faced in the past. It is far preferable for the US to act, not wait until it must react in response to such possibilities. Further, if Trump, using his experience with, and understanding of, other national leaders has felt vibrations, intimations that US forces were facing an increased danger from a certain direction in Syria, it would only be prudent him to be safe rather than sorry by moving those troops elsewhere. Correlatively, Trump would never be willing to take the chance of having the US plunged into a conflict on an adversaries terms.\n\nThe possibility must be considered that a clash between US forces and a prospective adversary on the ground in Syria could put US troops in real jeopardy. True, numbers are not everything, and the outcome of a military engagement that would include very capable US troops cannot be determined by simple bean counting. To avoid such clashes, since 2015, the US and Russia have maintained a \"deconfliction line\" to communicate the locations of their respective air and ground forces in Syria. Still, US troops have exercised their right to self-defense and clashes have occurred. When pro-Syrian regime fighters, mostly Russian mercenaries, attacked 40 US troops at their military base at a refinery near the town of Deir al-Zour in February 2018, around 200 of the attackers were killed. There were no US casualties. Despite that favorable outcome, circumstances may not stand in the favor of US troops on some other occasion. Russian military forces and the forces of other potential adversaries on the ground in Syria are actually formidable given their size and strength. They are close enough to US troops to pose a danger that should not be dismissed.\n\nThe order to withdraw US troops from Syria might have equated to the sounding of retreat if it had occurred following a very public threat from an adversary, or had occurred in the face of an adversary's deployment of its forces on the ground precisely to threaten US forces. A decision not to withdraw in response to such military threats from adversaries would likely require the deployment of greater numbers of US troops in Syria and perhaps preparation for a larger war in the region. This consideration has rarely been a factor discussed by Trump's critics and detractors and other observers in the US news media. However, it would only be a natural concern for any US president who has placed US troops in harm's way. Quod dubites, ne feceris. (Never do a thing concerning the rectitude of which you are in doubt.)\n\nAs with other US troops in the region, US forces in Syria face a significant threat from attack by potential adversaries in the region with long-range artillery and rockets in country and precision rockets from their countries or other locations in the region in which their forces are operating. The spectrum of possible attacks indeed goes beyond frontal assaults on the several small US bases in Syria's northeast. This consideration has also failed to find its way into the commentaries of Trump's critics and detractors and other observers in the US news media. The enemy has the ultimate say in how it might strike. Projections that fail to ascribe all probabilities and limit consideration to only some possibilities, perhaps the top five or top ten, while dismissing those they may feel are unlikely or de minimus, are flawed. To make a decision without the complete picture would be akin to walking down a blind alley.\n\nThere has always been the reality that Assad could attempt to strike US forces in Syria using his remaining chemical weapons stockpile, the same stockpile that the Russian Federation had confirmed that he had removed. Such an attack could be conducted as a suicide attack or \"martyrdom operation\". Assad could potentially conduct such an attack even if his regime was placed in complete jeopardy. Assad is a study in miscalculation and irrationality especially when it comes to military action. A surprise chemical attack against a US base in Syria could have a devastating effect, harming a great number of troops. US troops have guarded against any effort by Assad to put his forces in positions near their bases. Away from the combat zone of Syria, comfort may be found in the thought that US forces could respond to such a chemical strike with an immediate, devastating strike upon the regime, essentially destroying it. Still, a massive retaliatory against the Assad regime would do little to help any US troops lost or injured in such an attack. The US certainly cannot rely upon Moscow to keep Assad in check regarding his chemical weapons. In reality, the door has been left open to his madness for some time. Non omnes eadem amant aut easdem cupiditates studiaque habent. (Not all men love the same things or have the same desires and interests.)\n\nThe notion that the presence of US troops in Syria should remain to serve as a barrier or trip wires in case of attacks against US allies and friends by potential adversaries and also by other US allies and friends is abhorrent. With regard to dealing with US allies, the capabilities of US diplomats should not be underrated to the extent that military force posed against allies must suffice for skilled negotiation. As for potential adversaries, it is uncertain what would be the fate of US forces if an adversary launched a swift, concerted attack with combined arms against them. It would appear that many US political leaders, policy analysts, and particularly Trump's critics and detractors in the US news media are willing to wait and see what happens. Leaving US troops in Syria to continue as they have until the time that they might actually be attacked by an adversary could be called questionable judgment. It would essentially boil down to waiting around until casualties are suffered by US forces. Such thinking does not flow from the concept of America First. If having an available response in Syria is absolutely necessary, US military planners could develop a scheme, for example, to encamp US troops in nearby Iraq, Jordan, or perhaps even Turkey, arrange, determine ways to synchronize surprise deployments or powerful blows from vertical and ground assaults against an attacking force at a time and place of the choosing of US commanders. It might actually be a more effective way to place US forces in a position superior to that of an adversary in order to destroy it as effectually as possible.\n\nIf US troops in Syria were attacked in a concerted military way or were hit with some massive terrorist attack and losses were suffered, there is no guarantee that public support would exist nationally and that political will would exist in the US Congress for a large military build up in Syria and perhaps the start of a wider war in the region. Trump administration plans might very well be waylaid by a rebuff from the Congress given that control of the US House of Representatives has gone to the Democrats, the political party in opposition to Trump and his Republican Party, following the 2018 US Congressional Election. All indications are that the intention of the Democrats is to be activist, questioning decisions on foreign and national security policy of the US president and possibly uprooting some. (As these things go, the focus of Trump's political foes would likely be the tragedy of the attack, itself, and why more consideration had not been given, and why more had not been done, to ensure their safety and security. It might be then that the decision of keeping US troops in Syria would be lambasted as questionable judgment given the mission was so limited.) It would seem best for Trump to act now to ensure the safety and security of US troops, rather than face what could very well be: a tragic situation of unknown consequences; the need to make a decision under duress on whether to remain and fight or withdraw; and, if he decides to remain, almost ensure that he will contend with an enormous political battle over the fight in Syria with Congress. To act now, by withdrawing US troops, rather than wait for an adversary to decide their fate, could be considered prudent. Iniqua raro maximis virtutibus fortuna parcit; nemo se tuto diu periculis offerre tam crebris potest,Israel, Jordan, Turkey, and other regional actors, as well as European allies such as the United Kingdom and France, are already taking steps through airstrikes, ground incursions, raids, and other direct attacks to degrade well-known terrorist groups lurking in strongholds in Syria. Israel, in particular has focused also on placing severe limitations on the capabilities and capacity of a certain country that is also potential adversary of the US in the region. Yet, while such actions have been useful in curating the diverse ecosystem of military forces and terrorist groups on the ground, they have also increased the chances that those elements would attempt to lash out in retribution against US forces in Syria. Thus, as a result of the US troop presence in Syria, US allies have doubtlessly acted in a manner that would avoid precipitating such retribution. Planning for airstrikes in Syria, for example, was done by allies through the Coalition Air Operations Center at Al-Udeid Air Base in Qatar and independently at their respective national air operations headquarters with US troops on the ground firmly in mind.\n\nThe primary and strongest US ally in the region, Israel, has been somewhat restrained in its operations in Syria against some longtime adversaries, who have been malign actors not only in the region, but around the world. Upon the departure of US troops from Syria, Israel will be provided an opportunity, a freer hand, to engage in more effectual and perhaps more robust action there. No longer hamstrung by the potential misstep of provoking its adversaries to strike against US forces ostensibly in retribution for its attacks, Israel may decide to finally crack the problem of the presence of its adversaries being based so close to its sovereign territory. With likely the same minimum of attention its operations in Syria have attracted so far in the global news media, Israel can engage in concentrated operations to degrade its adversaries and eliminate threats with a tempo and ferocity such that those adversaries could no longer face losses inflicted upon them. To borrow a phrase from former US President Richard Nixon, Israel will have the opportunity to \"sock it to them!\" If those adversaries would choose to resist exiting Syria, in order to survive, they would very likely be required to redeploy in a way that would make them ineffective on the ground. Indeed, Israel might be able to create the type of environment in Syria that would cause pause among Islamic militant groups hoping to establish themselves in Syria. The extent to which the US might support or assist Israel with any efforts in Syria is uncertain. That would likely be decided sub rosa. However, the US would most likely step up and provide whatever might be possible. Turkey would also have a similar opportunity to respond more robustly against Islamic militant groups in Syria. Turkey's military capabilities, though, are somewhat limited in comparison to those of Israel and its increased efforts would likely require incurring greater risks.\n\nWith regard to impressions the withdrawal of US troops from Syria might have made upon the global audience, few capitals worldwide would likely equate their sovereign countries, whose nationhood and history they extol, to the autonomous Kurdish areas in Syria. While feelings of empathy may be felt by national leaders toward the Kurds situation, most would hardly commit anything too significant from their own resources in support of them. In fact, some national leaders would likely agree with the notion that US troops should be kept out of harm's way to avoid at least for now, a greater conflict in the region. Cito enim arescit lacrimal praesertim in alienis malis. (A tear quickly dries when shed for the misfortunes of others.)\n\nThe withdrawal of US troops from Syria will ostensibly eliminate all financial costs for the US related to that deployment. At the same time, Russia and other countries remaining in Syria will need to keep a robust military and security presence there in order to reasonably maintain control of the situation, or at control of that area referred to as \"Useful Syria\". They would most likely need to engage in many more operations against Islamic militant groups to secure peace as such groups may attempt to violently reestablish themselves in the country. The job of \"restoring Syria to its past glory\" through reconstruction will be incredibly difficult as Russia and one of the countries remaining in Syria are contending with punishing sanctions for misdeeds on other matters. They would surely be precluded collecting the amount of financial resources necessary to engage in such an undertaking successfully. As months and possibly years pass, the effects of wind and rain will make bomb-damaged, dilapidated buildings and other derelict structures even less appealing to the eye. The same global audience whose views on the US troop withdrawal were a concern for Trump's critics and detractors, would have an excellent opportunity to observe and assess what might be in-store for them if they too relied on the patronage of those countries. They could judge for themselves what leadership from those countries is really worth.\n\nRemoving the conventional US military footprint in Syria would place the responsibility to develop a complex comprehensive plan for reconstruction and peace-enforcement in the country squarely in the court of Russia and other countries who remain there. Any attempt to proceed without such a plan would be a huge blunder. Moving too slowly to repair Syria will allow ideal conditions to exist for an Islamic militant groups to attempt to fill the vacuum of power around the country. That is what occurred in Iraq after US forces were withdrawn. It was all pretty much foreseen by many US intelligence analysts. Unfortunately, the histories of Russia and other countries in Syria include no authentic success in such a reconstruction effort in contemporary times. As mentioned already, the economic circumstances of those countries are dire, shaped in great part by sanctions. That factor might do much to hinder them from gathering resources to engage in such an undertaking.\n\nConditions in Syria may not be optimal for the US, but Trump recognized that he was in a relatively favorable position to make the decision to withdraw, and he did so. Despite all of the bdelygmia, the decision appears to be the result of an in-depth examination of the realities of the Syria mission by Trump and his closest aides and advisers over time. The factors presented here reflect Trump's pattern of well-considering the short-term and long-term interests of the US, before taking any steps. With so many actors on the stage in Syria doing so many disparate and discreet things, it is also possible that some rarefied, furtive bit of information marked \"for the president's eyes only\" may have been behind the choice made.At the risk of unsettling readers by injecting in a bit of levity in the subject matter, one could say that Trump, the erstwhile owner of a plethora of casinos, is expert at knowing \"when to hold up, when to fold up, when to walk away, and when to run!\" youngAs reported in a September 15, 2013, Wall Street Journalarticle entitled \"US Backs Off Syria Strike for More Talk,\" the Obama administration took two steps back from its push for a prompt attack on Syria, allowing several weeks more for diplomacy on eliminating Syrian chemical weapons. The reversals on September 13th came after a week that began with US President Barack Obama insisting that the US Congress urgently approve military action. The Obama administration turned to a Russian diplomatic proposal that was actually suggested offhandedly by US Secretary of State John Kerry while answering a journalist's question on the possibility of military action being halted. Under the proposal, Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's ability to execute chemical attacks would be degraded over a period of time, without strikes. Yet, despite this diplomatic activity, the US made it clear, according to the Wall Street Journal, that military strikes, using an international coalition, and not the UN, were still very possible and any effort to stall the chemical weapons elimination process would not be acceptable. US officials also explained that there was also hope that through this diplomatic process, Kerry, the masterful statesman, and Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, his sparring partner, would be able to rekindle efforts to hold an international peace conference on Syria, bringing together the Assad regime and the Syrian opposition in Geneva in an effort to establish a transitional government in Damascus. .\n\nHowever, despite the importance of these recent events, there is a crucial matter, not referenced in talks between Kerry and Lavrov: the Islamic militant presence in Syria. Members of the US Congress gave great consideration to the issue during their deliberations on US military action in Syria. Islamic militant factions, laden with foreign fighters, truly represent a threat to security and stability in Syria and internationally. Anxious to garner as much support as possible from his former Congressional colleagues for immediate military strikes, when asked about the strength of the Islamic militant presence in the Syrian opposition forces, Kerry brushed off the issue of their presence in Syria as exaggerated. Yet, even under Kerry's assessments of the Islamic militant presence, it is clear that their numbers are significant, and they continue to grow exponentially daily. Unlike the secular groups and moderate Islamists in the Syrian opposition, it is inconceivable that the Islamic militants' would cease their struggle, particularly that of the foreign fighters, under any peace agreement with the Assad regime allowing for a transitional government. The Islamic militants' goals were never compatible with the Syrian opposition leadership's concepts and intent. While mainstream Free Syrian Army are directed at creating the basis for a transition to a democratic style government in Damascus for all Syrians, Islamic militant factions seek to create a separate Islamic state on Syrian territory, under Sharia law. Clashes between moderate, secular opposition groups and the Islamic militant factions have become commonplace. Atrocities are as likely to be committed against other opposition fighters and innocent Syrian civilians by Islamic militants, as Syrian military personnel or regime supporters. Unless an appropriate response is formulated and readied for implementation now or in the aftermath of the signing of a peace agreement, negotiators from the US and Russia will saddle Syria for the moment, or under a potential transitional government, with the scourge of the rogue Islamic militants. Unchecked, the Islamic militants would continue to pour into Syria, and establish a launch pad to create ferment in Syria, its region, and beyond. Examining the situation, two options for coping with the Islamic militants emerge: peaceful coexistence through negotiation and elimination through military action. The review of each will result in the emergence of one that would best serve US, Western, and regional interests, and especially the interests of the Syrian people.\n\nKerry's Assessment of the Islamic Militant Presence\n\nAs reported in a September 5, 2013, Reutersarticle entitled \"Kerry Portrait of Syria Rebels at Odds with Intelligence Reports,\" at Congressional hearings in early September, Kerry provided an assessment on Islamic militant factions among Syrian opposition forces that US and allied intelligence sources and private experts on the Syrian conflict suggest was optimistic. Kerry asserted before Congress that the armed opposition to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad \"has increasingly become more defined by its moderation, more defined by the breadth of its membership, and more defined by its adherence to some, you know, democratic process and to an all-inclusive, minority-protecting constitution. He reportedly told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on September 3rd that \"the opposition is getting stronger by the day.\" Representative Michael McCaul, a Texas Republican, challenged Kerry's assertions at the House Foreign Affairs Committee on September 4th. McCaul told Kerry: \"Who are the rebel forces? Who are they? I ask that in my briefings all the time.\" McCaul then explained, \"And every time I get briefed on this it gets worse and worse, because the majority now of these rebel forces – and I say majority now – are radical Islamists pouring in from all over the world.\" Kerry replied: \"I just don't agree that a majority are al-Qaida and the bad guys. That's not true. There are about 70,000 to 100,000 oppositionists . . . Maybe 15 percent to 25 percent might be in one group or another who are what we would deem to be bad guys.\" Kerry went on to explain, \"There is a real moderate opposition that exists. General Idriss is running the military arm of that,\" referring to General Salim Idriss, Commander in Chief of the Supreme Military Council, the Syrian opposition's military-wing and commander of the Free Syrian Army. Kerry reported that increasingly, Saudi Arabia and other Gulf states are funneling assistance through Idriss. This was a key point as prior, Arab states made deliveries of arms, supplies, and money directly to their main beneficiaries in the field, Islamic militant factions (Please see July 18, 2013 greatcharlie.com post \"Obama Emphasizes US Commitment to Syrian Rebels in Saudi Call, But He Can Still Change His Mind.\")\n\nLooking at US, EU, and NATO intelligence assessments of the Free Syrian Army to date in its September 5th article, Reuters interviewed a US official who explained, under the condition of anonymity, that \"Most of the groups battling against Assad are composed of Islamist fighters, but only a small minority could accurately be characterized as extremist.\" However, a second official, who also asked not to be named, explained that moderate opposition fighters appear to have lost strength rather than gained it in recent months. Due to their relative lack of weapons and organization, they are beginning to make alliances with better-armed Islamic radicals, whom they see pursuing more effective actions against Assad's forces, the official said. A European security official with experience in the region revealed to Reuters that more moderate rebel factions predominate in the east of Syria and along its southern border with Jordan but have largely devolved into \"gangs\" whose leaders are more interested in operating local rackets and enriching themselves than in forming a larger alliance that could more effectively oppose Assad's government. Joshua Foust, a former US intelligence analyst who now writes about foreign policy, told Reuters, \"I've heard that there are moderate groups out there we could, in theory, support.\" Foust went on to state, \"But I've heard from those same people and my own contacts within (US intelligence) that the scary people are displacing more and more moderate groups. Basically, the jihadists are setting up governance and community councils while the moderates exhaust themselves doing the heavy fighting.\"\n\nRealities of the Islamic Militant Presence\n\nIn early 2012, many Islamic militant factions, particularly the Salafist/Jihaddis, were operating underground in Syria. Two years of arms and support flowing into opposition forces from Arab states has allowed for the growth of Salafist/Jihaddi factions in Syria. The Islamic State of Iraq and Al-Sham (Syria), was active on the ground in Syria under the auspices of their parent group the Islamic State of Iraq (Al-Qaida in Iraq) for years prior to the civil war. Ever since the formation of Islamic State of Iraq, itself, the eastern region of Syria—bordering the Al-Anbar Province of Iraq—has been a hot spot for Al-Qaida activity. The Al-Nusra Front, a mostly Syrian organization, is considered an off-shoot of The Islamic State of Iraq and Al-Sham, and also Al-Qaida affiliated. The Islamic State of Iraq and Al-Sham and the Al-Nusra Front have been a driving force in the Free Syrian Army. For the balance of the civil war, Al-Nusra Front has led Free Syrian Army assaults on key installations, air defense bases, and coastal and highway routes. They have also been responsible for the bulk of the suicide attacks in civilian areas and assassinations of key officials in the Assad regime. They have become the best equipped, best-organized, and best-financed faction of the Free Syrian Army. Yet, they are now known best by their rogue acts. Several news organizations have been covering the Syrian civil war from its start. There are journalists in nearly each one who have observed or recorded members of Islamic militant factions abuse and kill captured Syrian military personnel or suspected Assad regime supporters. Some of their stories and recordings have been recently released. The front page of the September 5, 2013 edition of the New York Timesincluded a photo of Syrian Army prisoners being prepared for execution by Islamic militant rebels. This horrific scene brings home grave realities about the situation in Syria regarding the Free Syrian Army and the Syrian opposition's war on Assad. Nothing the Islamic militant factions have stated or done in Syria would indicate they have a remote interest in working constructively within the Syrian National coalition in reaching the country's transition toward a democratic form of government. Their plan to create an Islamic mini-state is already underway.\n\nDeadly clashes have raged between the mainstream fighters of the Free Syrian Army and Islamic militants while also at war with Assad regime forces. The fighting is viewed by intelligence and analysts and experts as a parallel struggle for Syria's future. In the greatcharlie.com post of July 11th, entitled, \"Opposition in Syria continues to Fracture, Yet This May Create a New Option for Its Allies,\" pointed to a July 8,, 2013, New York Timesarticle detailing how Islamist brigade of Ahrar Al-Sham, along with Al-Nusra Front fighters, ejected a mainstream Free Syrian Army unit, the Farouq brigade, from town of Raqqa. The Islamic militants accused the Farouq brigade of having hoarded arms and refused to go to the aid of allies during the Qusayr battle. They also alleged that some of its members of consorting with women and drinking wine. In the most recent violent incident, in Dana, members of an extremist Islamic militant faction were accused of beheading two rival fighters and leaving their heads beside a can near the town square. On July 2, 2013, the BBC confirmed Islamic militants killed a popular Catholic priest in the convent of the town of Ghassaniya. The priest had fled to the convent after his monastery, Saint Simon, was bombed by Islamic militants. In Aleppo and Idlib provinces, Al-Qaida affiliated Islamic militant units were accused of trying to monopolize wheat and fuel supplies creating even greater shortages for residents. Throughout towns and villages under Free Syrian Army control, Islamic militants have attempted to impose their strict conception of Islamic law, sometimes even carrying out summary public executions. This has created popular resentment against them among average Syrians. Since that time, Islamic militant factions have continued to abuse and kill Syrian citizens, and intensified their attacks upon mainstream Free Syrian Army groups and Kurdish groups. Popular secular Free Syrian Army commanders and fighters have been murdered by their so-called allies. So egregious have been the acts of the foreign fighters of the Islamic State of Iraq and Al-Sham against Syrian citizens, who did not support the regime, that the Syrians of the Al-Nusra Front, themselves, became perturbed and expressed displeasure over the foreign fighters announced plans to create their own Islamic state on Syrian territory.\n\nSignificant numbers of Islamic militants continue to pour into Syria. Pakistani Taliban have set up a base in Syria, to assess the needs of the jihad in Syria, and work out joint operations with Islamic militant factions present. Pakistani Taliban bases were allegedly set up with the assistance of former Afghan mujahedeen of Middle Eastern origin that have moved to Syria in recent years. The cell has the approval of militant factions both within and outside of Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan, an umbrella organization of militant groups fighting Pakistani government forces. In the past, Islamic militant fighters from Pakistan fought in the Balkans and Central Asia. Between 1992 and 1995, the group Harkatul Mujahedeen sent a large number of fighters to Bosnia to support the Army of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Between 1988 and 1994, Pakistan and Afghan Taliban fought in Nagorno-Karabakh on the side of Azerbaijan against Armenian forces. As long as Islamic militants continue to pour into Syria, their numbers and capabilities will reach a point where the mainstream forces would no longer be able to contend with them. Back in May 2013, the Russian Federal Security Service revealed that it was aware that 200 Russian and European fighters had joined the Free Syrian Army in May. By June 2013, at a conference in St. Petersburg, Russian President Vladimir Putin indicated the number of Russians and Europeans in the Free Syrian Army's ranks had reached 600.\n\nAs it was their goal in Syria, Islamic militant factions, may still seek to create an Islamic mini-state in Syria after the civil war. However, the creation of a separate state with separate laws for some Syrians, trapped in, would have to live by, would be an anathema to everything the Syrian opposition struggled for in the civil war. It would be a bitter reminder to the Syrian opposition of its failure to create a free and democratic Syria for all Syrians. Such a state would create fears, not only in Damascus, but in other capitals of the region, that an Islamic militant mini-state would become a launch pad for relentless attacks against them. Those nearby states include Israel, Iraq, Lebanon, Jordan, and Turkey. Leaders of the Syrian National Council, the political-wing of the opposition movement have found it difficult to communicate with representatives of Islamic militant factions. Communicating with the Islamic militant groups in the field on occasion has proven to be daunting. A number of secular Free Syrian Army commanders and fighters were killed attempting to make contact with Islamic militant factions. If an agreement is reached on Syria and it requires them to leave its territory, Islamic militant factions must comply. Ostensibly, an effort could be made to provide Islamic militant factions notice of their disposition in Syria under the authority of a transitional government. They would also need to be given official notice to leave Syria. This information could be communicated to representatives of their organizations by the Syrian National Council, leaders of the Supreme Military Council. If that were to fail, diplomats from Arab states that have been the primary benefactors for the Islamic militant units such as Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and Kuwait, could present notice to the Islamic militants. Those countries might have some leverage as the funding stream for the Islamic militants. However, the Islamic militants may be unwilling to respond. It would be easy enough for them to recognize the relative strength of their position against the transitional government.\n\nThe best case scenario would be similar to that of the foreign fighters present in Bosnia after the war. The Dayton Peace Agreement ending the war required foreign fighters to leave Bosnia. This demand was communicated to Islamic militant factions in Bosnia through the President of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Alijah Izetbegovic, and his government. It was enforced by the robust 60,000 member NATO force, I-FOR, that entered Bosnia immediately after the peace agreement was signed. However, many of the Islamic militants remained in Bosnia and were welcomed by Bosnia's Muslim community to do so. They married Bosnian women and became part of the society. Unlike Bosnia, there is little chance any community in Syria would want the Islamic militants present. The experiences of Syrian civilians with Islamic militant foreign fighters have been quite different from those of the Bosnians. Iranian Revolutionary Guards Corps units, Quds Force members, and Ministry of Intelligence and Security officers left Bosnia when the war ended. Yet, some Iranian troops who fought in the Bosnian War remained. Welcomed more warmly into the Bosnian Muslim community than any other group of foreigners, they also married Bosnian women and usually joined the Army of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Hezbollah completely evacuated Bosnia when requested to do so. As in Bosnia, fighters for Hezbollah would likely rapidly leave Syria and return to Lebanon. Unlike the Islamic militant factions opposing the Assad regime, Hezbollah's military-wing would be fairly easy to communicate with, either through Iran, its political leadership in Syria and Lebanon, and the Assad regime, through the Russians.\n\nIf Islamic militant factions were to comply with an order to leave Syria through a peace agreement, it is difficult to imagine where they would go. It is difficult to picture how their demobilization would be enforced. It is also difficult to envision how they would arrange transport anywhere given their numbers. Although Kerry's assessment of the size and strength of the Islamic militants was at 15 percent to 25 percent, that would still put their number in the tens of thousands. Further, essentially every Western intelligence organization has assessed they are growing in size and capability. Conceivably, they might charge into Iraq, Lebanon, Jordan, or Turkey, but their presence would not be tolerated in any of those states. They could possibly leave the Levant and travel to the heart of the Middle East, Southwestern Asia, South Asia, and North Africa, the Horn of Africa, Southeastern Europe, Western Europe, or Southern Russia! Yet, transportation would remain an issue, and it would still be difficult to find any country in those regions that would be interested in having them. They would pose immigration and security issues wherever they went.\n\nOption 2: Confronting Islamic Militant Factions During the War or Afterward\n\nIn a July 20th, New York Times article, David Shedd, deputy director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, and 31-year intelligence veteran suggested that in addition to strengthening the more secular groups of the fractious Syrian opposition, the West would have to directly confront more radical Islamist elements, although he did not say how that could be accomplished. He noted that left unchecked, they will become bigger,\" Shedd further stated, according to the New York Times article that \"Over the last two years they've grown in size, they've grown in capability, and ruthlessly have grown in effectiveness.\" Eventually, the Islamic militants would need to be confronted. It is unlikely that a transitional government would have sufficient military power to eject the Islamic militants from Syria. As was also explained on greatcharlie.com in its July 11, 2013 post \"Opposition in Syria continues to Fracture, Yet This May Create a New Option for Its Allies,\" the Obama administration would need to do more than meet its promise to arm the Free Syrian Army with weapons and ammunition. Only by intervening, covertly if necessary, on the side of mainstream Free Syrian Army groups against Islamic militant factions would mainstream opposition forces have a chance, during the war, of being positioned to defeat Assad's forces. Taking this step would put the US in a position to do much more on behalf of the Free Syrian Army and eventually, a transitional Syrian government.\n\nIf a prospective peace agreement in Syria required Islamic militant factions, postwar, to join some grand coalition in the transitional government and abide by its authority or leave Syria, they might not join. However, given their disposition, they would certainly refuse to go. It is unlikely that a transitional government would be ready to promote their interest, force them to leave. It might behoove the US, in support of the transitional government and its own interests, to assist the transitional government. The US could announce internationally that the Islamic State of Iraq and Al-Sham, the Al-Nusra Front, and other rogue Islamic militant factions are not part of the Syrian opposition. Indicating the degree of danger the Islamic militant factions posed to a secure and sustainable peace in Syria, the US could conduct an operation to destroy those organizations entirely as part of its Counterterrorism policy and in support of its Syria policy. The US could potentially muster its Western allies, as well as Russia and Iran to support its efforts. Assistance from Western allies, Russia and Iran could primarily include intelligence, however, operational assistance and personnel could also be requested. The operation, executed by the US Joint Special Operations Command, would need to be quick, intense, and effective. All Islamic militant groups hostile to the concept and intent of the Syrian opposition and the Friends of Syrian, and identified as having attacked mainstream Free Syrian Army fighters, would be identified and targeted for strike. Units, arms, equipment, supply lines, communications, commanders, headquarters, and financial support would be targeted. All entry points for Islamic militants should be identified and placed under special reconnaissance and electronic surveillance. Foreign fighters entering Syria must be targeted. Islamic militant units must be completely destroyed. Any foreign fighters later reaching Syria should not be able to find evidence that any Islamic militant factions ever existed there.\n\nA US decision to eliminate the Islamic State of Iraq and Al-Sham, Al-Nusra Front the and other rogue Islamic militant organizations in Syria would likely please the Russians and Iranians. If any cooperation on a counterterrorism effort could be established, there is a chance that step could further enhance joint diplomatic efforts between those countries on Syria. Among many things, for Iran, such an effort would allow it to work alongside the US and Russia, as an equal partner, and act as a power player in its region. For Russia, it would mean a resolution to the conflict, hopefully allowing it to pursue interests acceptable to the US in Syria. For the US, it would mean establishing peace and stability in the region, placing Syria on the path toward transition to a democratic government, and perhaps opening the door to further cooperation with Russia and Iran on other issues.\n\nAssessment\n\nMoving and destroying Assad's chemical weapons stockpile put the chemical weapons out of reach for Islamic militants in Syria. However, it does not address the issue of their presence. The current size and strength of Al-Qaida affiliated Islamic militant factions in Syria is considerable. Allowing them to become a fixture in Syria would hobble a transitional Syrian government, and could lead to its eventual collapse. The US Congress has pressed the Obama administration regarding the Islamic militants. Initially, Members of Congress, as well as legislators and officials in other Western capitals expressed concern that Western arms sent to Syria would fall into the hands of rogue Islamic militant factions, and their concerns were legitimate. Concerns were so great in Britain that its Parliament refused to allow its forces to join the US in military action in response to the August 21st chemical weapons attacks. Now is the time for the US Congress to urge the Obama administration to orient itself on coping with the Islamic militant problem. True, Congress was grumpy toward President Obama's approach to Syria, and perhaps should have been more supportive of the presidential authority. Yet, conversely, President Obama should be responsive to the concerns of Members of Congress, as representatives of the American people, over the Islamic militant problem in Syria. The White House should be able to recognize the urgency of this issue itself.\n\nNegotiating with the Islamic militants could be attempted, but it is implausible to think results could be achieved with them through formal talks. Only through military action, unilateral or multilateral, could the US relieve Syria of a barbaric Islamic militant threat. A transitional Syrian government will not have the means to eject Islamic militants from sovereign Syrian territory. The entire US effort in Syria hinges on how the US responds to the Islamic militant presence. Syria could become a state hampered by disunity and conflict caused by Islamic militants, or transform into a state ready to become a positive and welcomed player on the world stage. Through potential cooperation against rogue Islamic militant factions, the US, Russia, and Iran, the three states might create conditions that might facilitate greater cooperation on Syria among them. They may urge parties to the conflict to find a peaceful solution to the civil war. By working together to cope with the Islamic militant issue, the US, Russia, and Iran would take further steps forward together beyond the Syria issue, and establish a path toward real cooperation, possibly leading a resolution of the Iranian nuclear issue.\n\n(Over the past three months through blog posts, greatcharlie.com has been providing insights into US, EU, NATO intelligence assessments of the Free Syrian Army's situation on the ground, the organization's deterioration, and coping with the Islamic militant threat in Syria.

Please feel\nfree to call us or contact us online for a free consultation with one of our lawyers.\n\nBlog\n\nUnfit Living Conditions for Children in NJ\n\n28th Jan 2020\n\nYour child's teacher contacted DCPP, or someone else reported you for child abuse or neglect, and now a case worker wants to visit your home to investigate. What should you do? You should be prepared for what the case worker considers unfit living conditions that may constitute a danger to your child in New Jersey. To discuss how unfit living conditions may apply to your specific situation, contact an experienced New Jersey DYFS attorney on our team today. You can reach us online or call (908)-356-6900 for a free and entirely confidential legal consultation regarding your case. We are poised to defend you against any child protective services allegations that you may be facing in Essex County, Bergen County, Morris County, Passaic County, Union County, Somerset County, Sussex County, or anywhere else in New Jersey.\n\nWhat are Considered Unfit Living Conditions for a Child in New Jersey?\n\nThe New Jersey Division of Child Protection and Permanency (DCPP), the state's child protective services, deems unfit living conditions for a child those that pose a substantial risk of physical injury, meaning an environment that is likely to injure the child's health and well-being. For example, unfit living conditions may apply to parents who commit violence, abuse substances, have mental illness that threatens the safety of a child, or pose another risk of harm to their children. Under these four categories of harmful environments are specific behaviors that are considered potentially harmful to a child.\n\nFor instance, failure to provide food, clothing or shelter falls under the category of failing to provide basic needs. It may also include locking a child out of the home; under-dressing a child in cold weather; living in unsanitary conditions or in dangerous conditions, such as housing with exposed wires or without heating in winter; or feeding children insufficient amounts of food for their age or nutritionally deficient foods.\n\nExposing a Child to a Risk of Harm\n\nRisk of harm occurs when a parent or caregiver places a child in harm by the caregiver's behavior, such as exposing the child to criminal activity, for example, producing illicit drugs, selling weapons, harming one child with risk to another, violating court protective orders or other conduct that poses serious danger to a child. Risk of harm includes acts, such as leaving a child in a car unattended, driving while intoxicated with child in tow, or denying a child medical or dental attention when needed. All these factors are age dependent. Obviously, leaving a teenager waiting in a car unsupervised is not the same as leaving a toddler in the same place, or leaving a six-year old to babysit a two-year old is not the same as leaving a fifteen-year old with a young child.\n\nParental substance abuse endangers a child physically or emotionally by the parent's impairment, thereby threatening the child with neglect and exposing the child to risk of harm. Substances like alcohol, cannabis, hallucinogens, inhalants, opioids, sedatives, hypnotics, stimulants, and the like that affect the caregiver's ability to provide adequate supervision or which causes an infant to be born addicted to drugs pose significant risk of harm.\n\nFamily Violence in the Home\n\nUnder the category of abuse and violence comes family violence that causes a child to witness physical violence inflicted on one parent by the other or one parent on another person in the household or on the child. Verbal and sexual abuse, as well as patterns of threats, intimidation, economic control, torture and isolation are forms of family violence, whether witnessed or suffered by the child. Adults committing violent criminal behavior, such as assault on another adult member of the household, domestic violence, which may also harm a child, is considered to pose a substantial risk of physical injury.\n\nParent Reported for Unsafe Living Conditions, What Happens Next?\n\nWhen a report of unsafe living conditions reaches DCPP, the division opens an investigation to substantiate the abuse or neglect to the child, and if substantiated, a complaint is filed against the offending caregivers to get the neglect or abuse to stop and to protect the child. If appropriate, DCPP will consult with the accused caregivers in attempt to resolve the unsafe conditions and avoid the necessity of removing the child from the dangerous conditions and the caregiver creating them. If not possible or obviously futile, the child may be removed from the custody of the offending caregiver and placed in foster care or kinship care, for example, a close relative or family friend, until a permanent solution is found through the joint efforts of DCPP, the courts, parents and interested others that consider the best interests of the child.\n\nIn the interests of protecting the child and attempting to maintain family unity, DCPP can help families stay together by co-creating a plan with the family—parents, children and other household members or involved persons—to create a safe and healthy environment for the child or children in question. The plan includes commitments by all parties to make the necessary changes to fulfill the goals of protection, safety, and well-being of the child through services and resources provided to the family, such as therapy, financial counseling, substance abuse recovery, education, parenting classes, and other services and resources to effectuate the plan.\n\nThe case worker assigned to the family's case must make careful determinations each step of the way calculated to negotiate the paramount concerns of child safety, best interests of the child, and family unification, with the help of enlisted professionals providing services to the families, personal interviews and observations of the involved parties, division rules, policies and regulations, and the help of advisory personnel like the Deputy Attorney General. Even outside of individuals and Boards that oversee child placement review, the actions of DCPP must ensure they make reasonable efforts to keep the child home, either by vigorously working toward helping the family resolve their issues, to supervising the child in the home situation.\n\nAccused of Unsafe Living Conditions for a Child in NJ?\n\nBefore you sit down with a case worker, consult with a knowledgeable attorney experienced in dealing with DCPP, who can help you navigate the court system and know your rights.

The only occupations above cloud engineer -- systems architect and data architect -- surely do much of their work in the cloud, also.\n\n\"Which occupations saw the biggest increases in salary and job postings between 2018 and 2019?\" the report says. \"The short answer: Those that allowed businesses to wrangle and analyze data, build applications, and make sure those applications went into the world relatively bug-free.\"\n\n[Click on image for larger view.] Average Tech Salaries by Occupation (source: Dice).\n\nThe report is based on Dice's internal data from more than 12,000 technologists, providing insights such as:\n\nSalary trends by role, skill, city and more.\n\nHow employers can increase job satisfaction with perks beyond salary.\n\nWhich technologists will be looking for new employers in 2020, and how to best attract them.\n\nIn addition to listing salaries by occupation, Dice also listed highest average tech salaries by skills, a list dotted by data-related expertise -- especially Big Data -- with Apache Kafka, HANA, Cloudera, MapReduce and Cassandra in the top five.\n\n\"When it comes to skills and pay, it all comes down to that most basic of laws: supply and demand. With some older skills, the number of proficient technologists is relatively low, so employers end up paying a lot more to secure their services (this is a key reason why people who know their way around an ancient mainframe, for example, can earn very significant amounts of money; there's only a small number of active professionals with a grasp of decades-old hardware and operating systems),\" Dice said.\n\n[Click on image for larger view.] Average Tech Salaries by Skill (source: Dice).\n\n\"With 'hot' skills such as deep learning (a key method for machine learning), the same theme applies: A small but growing number of technologists have mastered these new technologies, and can extract high salaries from hungry employers. And sometimes, there are situations where a large number of technologists have mastered a particular skill, but the market for that skill is still so-white hot that salaries have kept rising; just look at how compensation for Swift, which is used to build apps for Apple's software ecosystem, has continued to rise despite a healthy pipeline of technologists who've mastered it.\"\n\nAverage annual technology industry pay was about $94,000 in 2019, which amounts to a 1.3 percent increase from 2018, a modest increase belied by much larger salary hikes in some \"emerging technology hubs\" across the country.\n\nDice followed up on its big salary report earlier this month with The Dice 2020 Tech Job Report focusing on \"demand for data-oriented technologists\" and those emerging tech hubs.\n\n\"Over the past few years, it's been all about containerization,\" Dice said in its February report. \"These 'containers,' or isolated user-space instances, allow everyone from developers to system administrators to test and deploy applications without worrying that a crash or a bad bit of code will take down an entire system. Kubernetes is an open-source platform that automates the management and deployment (as well as scaling) of containers, originally designed by Google but now (thanks to its open-source nature) adapted by any number of companies for very specific use-cases. Docker is a particularly popular tool for container management.\"\n\nThe prominence of cloud- and data-related skills and occupations in the report mirrors other recent industry studies.\n\nYet another January post by Indeed explored job trends in the cloud computing industry, finding growth in both the supply and demand sides of the market, but with some interesting changes lately, such as Microsoft's Azure cloud platform making inroads against competitors AWS and GCP in terms of job availability and interest.\n\nThe January post by Dice sums up the situation with some advice for organizations looking for talent: \"With the tech industry's unemployment rate at historic lows, and many technologists expressing satisfaction with their current job, employers today will need to take a holistic approach to recruiting. In addition to compensation and 'traditional' benefits such as healthcare and 401(k) match, employers should also consider that technologists are increasingly interested in emerging benefits such as college tuition reimbursement. With all that in mind, 2020 is the year for businesses to meet their recruiting goals by understanding and acting on the salaries and benefits that technologists value.\"", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "3fc7b71c-6a41-4fcd-a08a-73550d4507dc", "url": "https://virtualizationreview.com/articles/2020/02/21/salary-report.aspx"}
{"text": "A chapter of the National Audubon Society\n\nI bird alone\n\n\"I bird alone. With nobody else. And you know, when I bird alone I prefer to be by myself.\" — George Thorogood and the Destroyers, \"I Bird Alone\"\n\nI bird alone sometimes. Maybe most of the time. There are a couple of reasons for this. One is that I'm very slow. If I go out with Mike Manetz or John Hintermister or Adam Kent or Jonathan Mays, I'll say, \"Oh, look, a cardinal!\" and write \"Cardinal – 1\" in my notebook, and then I'll look up and find that my companions have recorded 37 species while I was doing that. On my own I'll see most of those 37 species … eventually … though it will take a bit of ambling and stopping and listening and peering up into the trees to find out what's making that noise. But birding alone I can do those things. I don't feel hurried by the fact that my companions have already processed the information and moved on to other birds. The other reason is that, birding alone, I'm led solely by my own perceptions and curiosity. If I see an unfamiliar wildflower I can stop to inspect it. If a Carolina Wren is doing something that baffles me I can pause and watch without having to catch up with my friends. I'm more thorough, and my notes are more complete, when I bird alone.\n\nBut I don't always bird alone. The most obvious reason is that I really enjoy the company of my fellow birders. There are plenty of other reasons. If I always birded alone I'd be stagnant. Birding with my betters challenges me. Birding with beginners is a surefire mood-brightener (especially when they think I'm an expert!), since it's enthusiasm and not proficiency that bonds birders together, and nobody is more enthusiastic than beginners. And birders at all levels are so often occupied with questions and observations that have never occurred to me, or that I haven't successfully resolved, that I almost invariably find their company enlightening. I'd guess that about 60% of what I know about birds – and not just birds, but all of natural history – I've learned in the course of birding with others.\n\n\"I have met with but one or two persons in the course of my life who understood the art of Walking, that is, of taking walks, who had a genius, so to speak, for sauntering; which word is beautifully derived 'from idle people who roved about the country, in the middle ages, and asked charity, under pretence of going à la sainte terre' — to the holy land, till the children exclaimed, 'There goes a sainte-terrer', a saunterer — a holy-lander. They who never go to the holy land in their walks, as they pretend, are indeed mere idlers and vagabonds, but they who do go there are saunterers in the good sense, such as I mean. … For every walk is a sort of crusade, preached by some Peter the Hermit in us, to go forth and reconquer this holy land from the hands of the Infidels.\" – Thoreau\n\nLoonacy is upon us. The spring migration of Common Loons begins in mid-March and slows noticeably after the first half of April, though I've seen laggards well into late May. Loons that winter on the southern Gulf Coast of Florida seem to gather in the Cedar Key area and then fly northeast across the peninsula, passing directly over Gainesville. They usually take off at about sunrise, and if you've got a clear view of the sky you can often see them pass overhead about an hour later. I don't think they fly in bad weather – or maybe it's just that I don't watch for them in bad weather – but if Sunday morning is fair, meet me at 8 a.m. on the US-441 observation platform at Paynes Prairie and we'll kick off this year's Loonacy with a loon watch.\n\nSpeaking of which, Scott Flamand saw the Pacific Loon on Lake Santa Fe on the 9th, \"still hanging out with the Common Loons.\"\n\nAn adult male Orchard Oriole visited Tom Hoctor's NW Gainesville yard on the 11th, one of the earliest spring arrivals ever reported in Alachua County and the first documented by a photo (which can be viewed on the Alachua County Birders' Facebook page).\n\nDean and Samuel Ewing saw the spring's first Black-necked Stilt at the US-441 observation platform on the 12th. Maybe it will put in an appearance on Sunday.\n\nKarl Miller at FWC is looking for people to run Breeding Bird Survey routes: \"There are currently 14 vacant routes this year.

{"text": "Search This Blog\n\nCrochet Class\n\nAs I mentioned previously I took a 3 week 'Beginning Crochet' class at Needlework Unlimited. The first week we learned how to chain, single, double, and half-double crochet. I practiced by making 5 washcloths and a scarf.\n\nThese are dish cloths for the kitchen - simple squares with 1 or 2 stitches combined. I love using these to clean pots and pans, I don't think I'll ever go back to store-bought dish cloths.After the dish cloths I decided to step it up a little and actually use a pattern. I found this on wash cloth on Ravelry and loved the pattern so I made it for me. After making a wash cloth for myself, Will had to have one too. Yet another pattern off Ravelry and I made this little number. The flower is separate, I was playing around with flowers and Will placed it on the wash cloth during the photo shoot. Next is my rainbow scarf. I used leftover yarn from one of the many baby blankets I've made and practiced my single crochet. About 2500 stitches later, I know my single crochet.\n\nThe next class I learned how to make granny squares which are now one of my favorite things! I've taken all of the scrap yarn I have around the house and I'm trying to make a pillow cover for the couch - pics of that coming soon.\n\nThe last week I learned how to read a pattern. I chose a slipper pattern from Ravelry and used some left-over yarn I had laying around. I haven't finished the second slipper yet - but I'm half way done with it. Crochet is really fun and very different than knitting. I'm still knitting quite a bit, but crochet allows me to work with color and shape in a completely new way - I'm hooked! (ha, ha - get it? crochet hook?)\n\nComments\n\nBrandy, You are so talented! I heart your rainbow scarf- so brillant and beautiful!!

{"text": "Recent cyberattacks expose physician practice weaknesses\n\nSecurity experts say small practices remain vulnerable but can take basic steps to help significantly reduce risk.\n\nThe recent rash of cybercrimes that either directly targeted or impacted healthcare institutions, including May's WannaCry ransomware attack, demonstrates that many in the medical community don't have strong enough electronic security.\n\n\"Sometimes the small practice physicians think they won't be targeted because they have less information, but what we're learning is that everyone is vulnerable because health data is very valuable,\" said Deven McGraw, deputy director for Health Information Privacy for the Office for Civil Rights at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).\n\nConsider a statistic from the nonprofit HITRUST Alliance, a collaboration of public and private healthcare technology, privacy and information security leaders. It found that 40% of doctor offices and medical practices working with HITRUST on cybersecurity had active malware or spyware after an assessment.\n\nHITRUST CEO Daniel Nutkis said many physician offices aren't following even the basic security measures to prevent attacks like WannaCry. They lack up-to-date hardware and software, they fail to download security patches and they skimp on endpoint and network security technologies.\n\n\"When you have deficiencies in all these areas, you're set up for failure,\" said Will Long, CISSP, CPHIMS, vice president and chief information security officer for information systems at Children's Health, a pediatric healthcare system in North Texas that includes Children's Medical Center Dallas and Children's Medical Center Plano..\n\nLong said he sees many physician groups affiliated with his medical institution struggle in those areas because they're, understandably, focused first on patient care and don't have a dedicated staff member to handle IT, let alone cybersecurity.\n\nHowever, Long, McGraw and Nutkis concurred that physicians should start by focusing on those three areas, following best practices that actually don't take significant resources to implement.\n\n\"We always urge practices to get all that right first and then move into other advanced things,\" Long said.\n\nLong listed several specific steps all physician offices should be doing to combat malware:\n\n• First, use up-to-date hardware and software. \"Stay mostly current, as close as you can,\" he said. \"You don't have to run the newest systems, but [don't run] the oldest system out there, either.\"\n\n• Be sure to update practice systems with patches as vendors release them, as many of those patches address vulnerabilities that hackers seek to exploit.\n\n• Invest in adequate endpoint and network protection software as well as training for employees, who in many cases still represent the biggest security threat because of the possibility they'll open or click on malicious email files.\n\n\"Usually getting all those basics correct is enough for the practice,\" Long added.\n\nSeeking assistance\n\nResources are available to aid practices with their cybersecurity strategies.\n\nA security risk assessment tool that's designed particular for smaller practices is available through the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (ONC). OCR also has\n\n.\n\nMeanwhile, HITRUST has CyberAid, a new program designed to help smaller healthcare organizations (specifically physician practices with less than 75 employees) address their cybersecurity needs. The program evaluates risk and identifies solutions and processes in a package that includes installation assistance, hardware, software, monitoring services, training and support. HITRUST, which sought discounts from vendors that are passed onto users in the pricing, offers CyberAid as a bundled program at varying price points depending on the organization size. The price for an office with 10 users, which is the starting package size, costs $600 annually.\n\nLong said he is collaborating with small physician practices affiliated with Children's Health to bring CyberAid to those offices, which will help protect not only those practices but the entire ecosystem.\n\n\"They work very closely with us. They're logging on to our EHR every day. They're operating in our environment, emailing us, sending attachments, uploading documents into our EHR, so we want them to be secure,\" he said.", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "1f1eeed3-bc3d-42c9-aa1e-49627f004353", "url": "https://www.medicaleconomics.com/view/recent-cyberattacks-expose-physician-practice-weaknesses"}

Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) is considered the leading cause of death throughout the world. But thanks to the University of Washington for creating this tool to combat cardiac arrests.\n\nThe University of Washington has created a new tool which constantly monitors its surroundings for signs of gasping sound known as agonal breathing. Called the support vector machine (SVM), it can continuously monitor its surroundings for signs of a heart attack and call for help if something appears to have gone wrong\n\n\"The good news is that if you can detect these agonal breathing sounds, you can almost double or triple someone's chance of survival if you're going to give them immediate CPR,\" Shyam Gollakota, a professor at the University of Washington and one of the authors on the study.\n\n\"We envision a contactless system that works by continuously and passively monitoring the bedroom for an agonal breathing event, and alerts anyone nearby to come provide CPR. And then if there's no response, the device can automatically call 911,\" He added.\n\nIn the process of obtaining audio for their algorithm, the researchers relied on real 911 calls of cardiac arrests. A total of 236 agonal breaths were extracted and then they were re-captured through smartphones and smart speakers with other household sounds like sounds of snoring, AC, pet sounds. The researchers then used machine learning techniques to grow the number of heart attack-indicating breaths to more than 7,000. For the control group, they used 83 hours of audio data from sleep studies to derive 7,305 sound bytes of normal sleep sounds.\n\nThe machine learning algorithm was then put to the test. The tool correctly identified the telltale gasping breath 97 percent of the time. The ordinary sleeping sounds were misclassified 0.14 percent of the time.\n\nThe worldwide launch of this service is still to be seen. It is still one of the most remarkable technologies that will become indispensable for millions of people in the future.", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "5b9269cc-9bef-4de5-accf-efa4426fef36", "url": "https://tutorialslink.com/news/THE-FUTURE-OF-TECHNOLOGY-ALEXA-COULD-SAVE-YOU-FROM-A-HEART-ATTACK/978"}
{"text": "Staying active in small spaces\n\nTéa Miyanaga\n\n28 May 2020\n\nBeing active is hard enough without having a literal pandemic going on. Now that many facilities are closed, it is tougher than ever to maintain your fitness on top of worrying about your studies. Here are some tips for keeping active this spring!\n\nGet motivated\n\nThe hardest part of staying active, whether you're in a pandemic or not, is actually getting in gear to work out. Here's how to stay on top of things when getting out of your PJs at 3 pm seems overwhelming.\n\nSet achievable goals The looming thought of a 10K or 200 sit-ups in one session is enough to scare most of us out of our running shoes—start with goals that are achievable and that help build strength and stamina. You don't have to meet the Rock's workout regimen. Go outside and get some fresh air for 30 minutes instead! Success in small steps will open the doors.\n\nMake a work-out schedule A good tik tok session might take you anywhere from 30 minutes to 3 hours. We get it. Make a work-out schedule to plan ahead around your midterms, assignments... and whatever else. You'll feel less guilty about using study time to get fitness in. Try dividing a 45-minute workout into 20 minutes of cardio, 15 minutes of strength training and 10 minutes for stretching. Short on ideas? Try these!\n\nKeep yourself accountable with a friend or online class If you need a little extra push to get moving, a friend or a coach can be a huge motivator. CBC has a great list of free online classes that you can try. Committing to attend makes you less likely to bail at the last second!\n\nAll the gyms are closed :(\n\nI am a huge gym goer and I am missing stationary bikes and the squat rack like crazy—but there are other ways to get your blood pumping!\n\nTake advantage of Edmonton Ever heard of \"urban hiking?\" Edmonton is an excellent location for getting outdoors and exploring, with our extensive trail system, river valley and many neighbourhood walking and biking paths. AllTrails is a perfect place to start if you are looking for a new area to walk or run close to home—and they have an app, too.\n\nTry new forms of cardio Without ellipticals and treadmills, many of us are in need of a new form of cardio. If you're like me and despise running, or maybe you don't own a bike, there are still many options get that cardio in! I have been trying out Zumba and other dance workouts, a dynamic stretch program called Essentrics and jumping rope with equipment I purchased for under $15 on Amazon.\n\nUse what's around you You might have to get a little creative incorporate some tools into your workout. Try filling 4L milk jugs with water for an adjustable weight with a handle, or soup cans for something a little lighter. Desk chairs and bed frames also work great for support for tricep dips and other exercises.\n\nSupport your fitness with balance\n\nPhysical activity is just one part of maintaining your health. Don't forget to consider other aspects of your lifestyle when increasing your fitness.\n\nEat a balanced diet Working out takes a lot of energy. If you've been ordering Skip as much as I have, you might have to change it up. Eat high protein foods like eggs, nuts and legumes. You can also stock up on your leafy green veggies and other high in fibre foods. If eating balanced is a pain, try daily multi-vitamins to keep up with nutrients you might be lacking.\n\nSleep schedule is key! Lacking the energy to get going? Reevaluate your current sleep schedule. Even though you might be getting more than your recommended 7-8 hours, an inconsistent sleep schedule can lead to drowsiness, concentration issues and weight gain. Try and wake up at the same time everyday even if you need to compensate with a nap later.\n\nGo easy on yourself At the end of the day, remember that we are living through a time unlike any other in the modern era—be kind to yourself! It is okay to not get out everyday and beat your personal best. Take care of yourself physically as well as mentally and take a break when you need it.\n\nBe part of a vibrant community and benefit from specialized programs geared towards your success. Choose housing that best suits your lifestyle and get more out of your university experience.", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "e473eef4-a726-4536-a3eb-2744b1906790", "url": "https://www.ualberta.ca/residence/blog/staying-active-in-small-spaces.html"}

{"text": "History repeats election with government in power for decade accused of being out-of-touch\n\nIt was a February election in which the government had been in power for a decade and was accused of being out-of-touch and elitist.\n\nThe government party in turn accused the main opposition of being run by shadowy gunmen and of having policies that would bankrupt the State.\n\nThe parallels between the 1932 general election, the most important in the history of the State, and the current election, do not end there.\n\nThe Cumann na nGaedheal government was accused of being wasteful with public money in the depths of the Great Depression. The Shannon scheme, the children's hospital of its day, ran three times over budget. There was also a Royal Irish Constabulary (RIC) legacy, a dispute over who should pay their pensions, which Fianna Fáil used to smear Cumann na nGaedheal as a party of west Brits.\n\nLike their modern-day descendants in Fine Gael, Cumann na nGaedheal had a foreign policy triumph it could not exploit at the ballot box. The Statutes of Westminster in 1931 was the Brexit issue of the day. It enshrined in law the autonomous nature of the dominions within the British Empire of the Irish Free State, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa.\n\nHowever, Cumann na nGaedheal was acutely sensitive to criticism that it was too deferential towards the British.\n\nTaoiseach Leo Varadkar speaking at Fine Gael's headquarters in Dublin before an image of an old election poster for Cumann na nGaedheal. Photograph: Fiach Kelly/The Irish Times\n\nAs Tim Pat Coogan has pointed out: \"He (WT Cosgrave, the president of the Executive Council) had to mute his quite substantive triumphs in Anglo-Irish relations lest he give aid and comfort to both British conservatives and Irish Republicans\".\n\nClass warfare\n\nIn response to Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin's claim that Fine Gael was the party of privilege, the Taoiseach Leo Varadkar suggested there has never been \"class war in Irish politics and it shouldn't start now\".\n\nThis is incorrect. Class warfare was present from the beginning in the battle between the State's two big parties. The Treaty was not the only thing that divided them.\n\nCumann na nGaedheal, the forerunner of Fine Gael, was relentlessly pilloried as a party of west Brit toffs. Their leadership was often caricatured in the political cartoons of the time as wearing top hats and tails, the unofficial uniform of the British establishment.\n\nThe association of Cumann na nGaedheal with privilege was exemplified in Fianna Fáil's 1932 general election poster slogan paraphrasing Abraham Lincoln: \"Government by the rich for the rich\". By contrast, Fianna Fáil promised the 1932 equivalent of \"an Ireland for all\".\n\nAt a time of austerity, in which public pay was cut, Fianna Fáil regularly raised the cost of keeping the office of the governor-general of the Irish Free State, the British king's representative in Ireland.\n\nCumann na nGaedheal hit back by attempting to smear Fianna Fáil as a party in thrall to sinister forces. Its most famous election poster \"the Shadow of a Gunman, keep it from your home\" sought to portray Fianna Fáil as a party which had a legacy of violence in ways that will be familiar to the modern-day taunts directed at Sinn Féin.\n\nTaoiseach Leo Varadkar has a daily reminder of this campaign in his office as a party poster from 1932. It portrays de Valera with a gun jammed into his back by an IRA gunman. It also references Saor Éire, a revolutionary, republican organisation founded in 1931 which was associated with communism.\n\nCumann na nGaedheal sought to exploit the notion that Fianna Fáil was a party in thrall to communists. Fanciful as it seems now, given Éamon de Valera's subsequent record, this was a real fear at the time. Moreover, Cumann na nGaedheal described de Valera's policies as \"un-Irish and un-Catholic\".\n\nFront page Irish Times advertisement taken out by Cumann na nGaedheal on the morning of the election, February 16th 1932\n\nIt was articulated in a famous front page Irish Times advertisement taken out by Cumann na nGaedheal on the morning of the election, February 16th 1932: \"The gunmen and Communists are voting for Fianna Fáil today - vote for the Government party\".\n\nCumann na nGaedheal ran on its record and its campaign was mostly negative. It offered no solutions to the problems of unemployment and poverty which were rife in Ireland at the time, instead emphasising its status as a safe pair of hands at a time of global turbulence.\n\nThe continual scare tactics would appear to have been an example of the law of diminishing returns similar to the way that repeated warnings about contemporary Sinn Féin and its links to the IRA appear to be diminishing with a new generation given the opinion polls.\n\nFianna Fáil victory\n\nThe Irish public was no longer interested as the historian Mel Farrell points out in his book Party Politics in a New Democracy: The Irish Free State, 1922-37: \"In September 1927, Fianna Fáil was an unknown quantity. By 1932, it was just like any other party thereby undermining Cumann na nGaedheal's negative campaign. This time, the circumstances suited de Valera and his party appealed to new and first time voters.\n\n\"His arguments for an alternative approach seemed insurmountable given the scale of change occurring across Europe. Fianna Fáil was able, successfully, to exploit the economic discontent and challenged Cumann na nGaedheal's orthodoxies by promising increased welfare measures and the implementation of protectionism\".\n\nThe result of the 1932 general election was a victory for Fianna Fáil. The party increased its seats from 57 to 72 and its percentage share of the vote from 35.2 per cent to 44.5 per cent. Cumann na nGaedheal declined from 38.6 per cent to 35.2 per cent and it lost eight seats.\n\nFianna Fáil fell five seats short of a majority and was able to form a government with the support of the Labour Party. Unhappy with his slim mandate, de Valera called a snap election in January 1933. This time he won a majority of one, but widened his margin of victory over Cumann na nGaedheal winning 76 seats as against his opponents 48. Fianna Fáil's status as the largest party would last until 2011.\n\nThe fears over Fianna Fáil being controlled by shadowy gunmen proved unfounded. De Valera angered many of his old anti-Treaty comrades by banning the IRA in 1936. Six IRA men were executed during the Second World War.\n\nHe also proved to be as punctilious in his relation with the Catholic Church as his predecessors had been.\n\nThe most important thing about the 1932 general election is that there was a peaceful handover of power from one bitter rival to another as Farrell points out: \"Nine years after the end of the Civil War, there was a peaceful and democratic handover of power from its victors to its vanquished - something that is noteworthy when we look at the turbulent history of Europe during the 1930", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "52cfe870-3816-4c10-8ab2-a05713f8ee4b", "url": "https://www.irishtimes.com/news/politics/class-warfare-and-shadowy-gunmen-how-the-2020-election-echoes-1932-1.4163679"}

There is a shaming message coming from the black community toward the majority in our country.

This means that to not accept what SAP says as true, means being accused of providing incorrect information or FUD about SAP.\n\nConclusion\n\nMohamed Judi and other SAP resources do not use thought in determining if something is true.

{"text": "So what is the best workout for fat-loss? What areas do our members and biggest transformations focus on when they're working out in our group classes here at DSC?\n\nYou might be surprised.\n\nWe have been led to believe that cardio, cardio, and more cardio is answer. We have been told that running endless miles on the treadmill or strapping yourself into that spin bike for an hour is the answer.\n\nAlthough various forms of cardio should be a big part of your exercise regimen, it should NOT be the only part.\n\nAnd the research agrees.\n\nCountless studies have shown that when it comes to exercise and fat-loss, cardio training alone is not enough. Even when we see early progress in fat-loss with cardio training, results quickly plateau due to our bodies' incredible efficiency.\n\nIn other words, the more we run or cycle, the better we get at it and the less calories we then burn doing it.\n\nNot only is completing only cardio training bad for long-term fat-loss results, it doesn't give us that toned look and feel many desire because it can actually decrease our muscle as it uses it for fuel.\n\nThis is bad news as the more muscle we have, the more calories we burn throughout the day, keeping us lean.\n\nOn top of that, too much cardio can drastically increase our risk of injury, especially overuse injuries and pain at our hips, knees, ankles and feet.\n\nThe best results and improvements in fat-loss come from the combination of cardio and strength training.\n\nThis is the very foundation of our group workouts here at DSC and a key component to our member's incredible success.\n\nWe call it metabolic resistance training. That is a fancy way of saying we strength train or lift weights while keeping our heart-rates elevated, mainly in circuit-training formats. These style of workouts actually burn more calories throughout them than traditional cardio and keep you burning calories during the day.\n\nAs you'll see in the sample fat-loss workouts below, we structure our workouts in a circuit format. This means we complete our exercises in order with minimal rest. This keeps us moving, sweating, improving our cardio, and burning calories. Then we add resistance to our exercises in the form of equipment like kettlebells, barbells, dumbbells, medicine balls, and even our own body. This takes our workouts to a whole new level and intensity, helping us build muscle and strength, and shred even more fat!\n\nWhat's important to note though is that the benefits of metabolic resistance training go well beyond fat-loss.\n\n1st -- It builds core and total-body strength.\n\nThis is crucial for improving your overall performance and injury prevention in and out of the gym.\n\n2nd -- It improves flexibility, posture, and imbalances.\n\nGetting stronger in the right areas will help you work areas that are typically neglected during traditional cardio exercises. These are areas like your abs, the muscles that pull your shoulder back and improve your posture, and your glutes.\n\n3rd -- It's FUN!\n\nThis is one of the most beneficial aspects of metabolic resistance training. The variety, the workouts and how you construct them, and the equipment you can use is endless. Imagine actually looking forward to and enjoying your workouts. Metabolic resistance training allows you to keep things fun and fresh, improving your consistency and in-turn your fat-loss results.\n\nBye-bye treadmill, hello results!\n\nLet's get into your fat-loss workouts! Have FUN!\n\n1| Beginners Fat-Loss Workout\n\nAre you new to working out? We have the PERFECT starting point for you with our beginners fat-loss workout.\n\nThis circuit combines some of our foundational kettlebell, body-weight and medicine ball exercises.\n\nTake your time and ease yourself into the movements. Aim to get a little better every time you complete this workout.\n\nHere's how it works:\n\nSet a clock for :20 of work and :40 of rest. This means you will complete each exercise for :20 at your own pace and rest for :40 before moving to the next exercise in order. Complete 2-4 rounds and rest 1-2 minutes between rounds.\n\n2| Kettlebell Fat-Loss Workout\n\nThe kettlebell is one of our favorite pieces of fitness equipment. Their shape and handle allow for an endless variety of exercises that are fantastic for burning fat.\n\nHere's how it works:\n\nThis workout is a countdown. Set a clock for 10-15 minutes. Start on the right side and complete 12 reps of each exercise. Once you've completed each exercise, do the same on the left side. Once you've finished both sides, move to 10 reps of each exercise and again complete both sides, then move to 8 reps and so on. See how low you can get in the countdown before the time runs out.\n\n3| Landmine Fat-Loss Workout\n\nThe landmine attachment is one of our favorite fat-loss workout tools. It is a movable piece that you put one end of a barbell into. The attachment piece allows the barbell to move freely, giving you an unlimited variety of fat-loss and strength exercises to choose from. The landmine is a fantastic way to shred fat and add variety and fun to your workouts.\n\nHere's how it works:\n\nSet a clock for 10-15 minutes. Each landmine exercise will stay at 6 reps. Complete each exercise in order and then complete :30 of your lateral bounds. Once you finish your lateral bounds, start back at the top and see how many rounds you can complete. Also, look to add a bit more weight to the bar each round.\n\n5| Medicine Ball Fat-Loss Workout\n\nTime to burn some fat and spice up that workout routine with the medicine ball!

{"text": " hybrid design of traditional GaAs-based solar cell combined with colloidal CdS quantum dots. With anti-reflective feature at long wavelength and down-conversion at UV regime, the CdS quantum dot effectively enhance the overall power conversion efficiency by as high as 18.9% compared to traditional GaAs-based device. A more detailed study showed an increase of surface photoconductivity due to UV presence, and the fill factor of the solar cell can be improved accordingly.\n\n1. Introduction\n\nThere have been tremendous efforts to develop new green technologies to alleviate the global warming and energy crisis. Among them, novel photovoltaic materials and devices are especially important since solar cell can be integrated into our daily life easily and thus make more impacts towards energy saving. How to provide an effective way to convert solar energy into electricity is thus an important scientific issue. Since the invention of the solar cells in the 1950's, many methods and device architectures have been proposed and realized either in the lab or commercially, such as crystalline/amorphous Si-solar cell [1], chalcopyrites [2, 3], dye-/quantum-dot-sensitized solar cells [4–6] and single-/multi-junction III-V solar cells [7–9] etc. While most of these solar cell technologies provide satisfactory results, it is III-V materials that claimed the highest power conversion efficiency (PCE) so far [10, 11]. Meanwhile, the detailed-balance Shockley-Queisser limit (SQ limit) [12] puts an upper limit of 44% for the cell with single band gap material, which is yet to be conquered.\n\nOther than semiconductor bulk or epitaxial materials, there has been a long history of utilizing colloidal quantum dots (or nanocrystals) as the active layers in solar cells. The benefits of adapting quantum dot material in the solar cell are mainly for low-cost, large area, flexible substrates and potentially high efficiency. Many extraordinary works were reported for light detection [13], tandem solar cells [14] etc. However, most of the results were limited to 10% PCE or less. How to combine both the versatility of the quantum dot material and the high PCE in semiconductor device becomes an interesting topic to research. One of the major limits in current solar cell is the lack of absorbing material at ultraviolet (UV) region. These high energy photons get absorbed quickly in the bulk material but the carriers are consumed near the surface by the traps and defects. This portion of sunlight takes up to 7% of the overall energy [15], and this percentage is even higher in the outer space. Therefore, efficient use of UV part of the solar spectrum for energy conversion is crucial. If UV photons can be harvested, it is then possible to approach the aforementioned SQ limit. One possible solution is to utilize semiconductor based quantum dots (QDs) such as CdS, CdSe, in the regular solar cell. These nano-scale materials have strong UV absorption and efficient visible down-conversion [16]. If the down-converted photons can be properly collected by the host material underneath, the UV photons can then be counted as effective as other longer wavelength ones. Theoretically, if we have 100% down-conversion efficiency and these converted photons can be completely absorbed and transferred into electrical carriers, another 7% of overall energy can be added to the present III-V solar cell [15]. This 7% belong to the aforementioned solar UV spectrum and is not related to other effects such as anti-reflection. The cell itself is still subject to the SQ limit, but the practical PCE upper limit can be raised with this down-conversion. Previous works [17–23] have demonstrated that it is possible to use colloidal quantum dots (CQDs) or other substances (such as dye) to promote the efficiency of Si-based solar cells, either by anti-reflective (AR) effect due to the gradient refractive index introduced by the film or by the down-conversion transition of the CQDs. However, most of the results focused on silicon devices, and we are still short of an experiment on the direct band gap material. Such test can be used for a good comparison of the quantum dot effect between the direct/indirect band gap materials. In this work, we demonstrate a strong efficiency-enhanced photovoltaic response due to the introduction of CdS quantum dots on the GaAs device surface. The physics behind this phenomenon can be investigated by the solar simulator, quantum efficiency measurements, and the increase of surface charges at the presence of the quantum dots can be further proved by a pure UV excitation.\n\n2. Experiment and device design\n\nThe single-junction p + -n GaAs solar cell structures were grown by the low pressure (50 torr) metal-organic chemical vapor deposition in a vertical reactor (Veeco D180). A Si-doped n-type GaAs substrate (100) off zero degree was used for the deposition. Trimethyl (TM-) sources of aluminum, gallium, and indium were used for group-III precursors, while arsine and phosphine were used as the group V reaction agents. Silane (SiH4) and diethylzinc (DEZn) were used as the n-type and p-type dopant sources, respectively. The growth rate for all arsine based layers was kept at 2.0 μm/h, while the indium source was precisely controlled by an Epison controller system. The V/III ratio was kept at 200 for a growth temperature range of 600–720 °C in this work. The uniformity of bulk layer thickness during the epitaxial growth was maintained to a less than 0.4% standard deviation in a 3-inch wafer. The epitaxial growth started from depositing a 300-nm-thick n + -GaAs buffer layer, followed by a 100-nm-thick n + -Al0.3Ga0.7As back-surface-field layer, and a 3.5-μm-thick n-GaAs base layer. The emitter layer is a 500-nm p + -GaAs, capped by a p + -Al0.8Ga0.2As window layer. Finally, the solar cell structures were completed by capping a 300-nm-thick p + -GaAs contact layer. After epitaxy, the fabrication processes, including photo-lithography, chemical etching, and metallization, were taken so as to fabricate the solar cell devices. In this study, back-side n-contact metal was formed by evaporating AuGe (250 Å)/Au (5000 Å), while the front p-contact was consisted of evaporated Ti (250 Å)/Pt (250 Å)/Au (5000 Å). The shadow loss of the front strip contacts is 3.5%, and area of the cells is 1 cm2. After the device was finished, three different samples were prepared for comparison: the first one is a clean and uncoated GaAs cell with colloidal CdS QDs with a concentration of 0.5 mg/mL spun on the surface, denoted as GaAs I. The second sample is the GaAs cell with clean surface and no AR coating, denoted as GaAs II. The third sample is the GaAs cell with AR coating centered on 670nm, named as GaAs III. A schematic plot of the finished single-junction GaAs solar cells with CdS QDs was shown in Fig. 1\n. The quantum dots that were used in our experiments were CdS nano-crystal produced by Sigma-Aldrich Corporation with an average size of 5 nm in diameter. In the GaAs I samples, we also took the cross-sectional TEM picture (Fig. 2\n), which shows multiple layers of quantum dots stacking on the surface of the device. After the device was finished, we went through the regular solar simulator test and external quantum efficiency measurement for basic device performance. The conductive atomic force microscope (CAFM), which would be used for surface photoconductivity, was performed in a Veeco Dimension 3100 Scanning Probe Microscope (D3100).\n\n3. Device results and discussion\n\nFigure 3(a)\nshows the absorbance and photoluminescence spectrums of CdS QDs in toluene. The photoluminescence spectrum was measured by the 365 nm excitation, and a major emission peak at 460 nm was found. In absorbance spectrum, a sharp rising edge was detected around 450nm and a steady increase from 400 nm on. Therefore, this CdS QD layer is capable of converting ultraviolet photons (λ<400nm) to the visible blue band. On the other hand, when applied to GaAs surface, even as thin as several tens of nanometer, due to its intermediate refractive index (n~2.4), a global reduction in reflectance spectrum compared to bare semiconductor surface (as in Fig. 3(b)) was observed. The CQD layer is certainly not as good as the regular anti-reflective (AR) coating in longer wavelength but its low reflectance in shorter wavelength is impressive.\n\nFig. 3(Next, the basic parameters of these devices were characterized by photovoltaic I-V curves and external quantum efficiency (EQE) measurement. The photovoltaic I-V characteristics were measured under air mass 1.5 global illumination and room temperature conditions by a class-A solar simulator complying with the IEC 904-9 standard. The results of three different types of GaAs solar cells were shown in Fig. 4\n. The important device parameters are summarized in Table 1\n. The short-circuit current density (Jsc) of the GaAs I (GaAs + CQDs) can reach 26.99 mA/cm2 and its power conversion efficiency increases from 17.71% to 21.06%, corresponding to a 18.9% enhancement compared to the device without AR coating (GaAs II). When compared with the optimal AR coated device (GaAs III), the GaAs I sample still edges out by 4.1% increase in Jsc and 2.7% enhancement in overall power conversion efficiency. Additionally, open-circuit voltages (Voc) of these devices show no degradation, and the change in fill-factor (FF) is negligible.\n\nTo further understand the utilization efficiency of photons with different wavelengths, the spectral response of the EQE was taken, and a xenon light source is used as the illumination source. Figure 5(a)\nshows the EQE as function of illumination wavelength for all three types of samples, and Fig. 5(b) shows the EQE enhancement factor of the GaAs I, compared to GaAs II. From EQE spectrum, the universal enhancement of GaAs I against GaAs II is exhibited, and the curves of GaAs I and GaAs III crisscross at 600nm. While the differences of EQE between CQD-coated and non-CQD-coated GaAs devices maximize at 520nm range, the ratio (EQEGaAs I/EQEGaAs II) grows rapidly once moved into ultraviolet regime (λ<350nm), and can be as high as 1.75 times. This result demonstrates an efficient down-conversion can subsidize the UV-generated carrier collection probability. In this scenario, the UV photons can be absorbed by CQD layer and re-emitted blue photons can be absorbed and converted much better in the bulk GaAs.\n\nwhere Jsc is the short-circuit current, λ is the photon wavelength, IAM1.5G is the intensity of the AM1.5G solar spectrum. We can further calculate the percentage that comes from quantum dot down-conversion. Ideally the photons shorter than 450nm are counted as the down-converted ones, and we use the above equation to identify that there are about 11% of enhancement of short-circuit current coming from this down-conversion.\n\nTo understand more on UV response of the CQD coated devices, a UV lamp was used as the light source to test their IV under the excitation with higher photon energies. Even though our UV lamp is not standard, the enhancement of Jsc is quite clear in Fig. 6\n. When a bandpass filter (at 380nm, FWHM is 10nm) was placed to further reduce the number of low-energy photons, a rising trend of efficiency versus filtered power was observed in Fig. 6, and a constant efficiency enhancement factor of 1.22 times to the no-CQD sample was measured. Another interesting feature that is not seen in previous shown good device is the improvement of the fill factor (FF). For a device with a bad FF as in Fig. 6, adding CQD layer on its semiconductor surface modify its photoconductivity dramatically [25] and the FF becomes much better. The increment can be as large as 30% (from 57% to 74%). In addition to macroscopic IV measurement, conductive AFM is another tool for microscopic analysis. In the normal CAFM measurement, a fixed voltage (5V) is applied on the tip of the probe, and the current is drawn from the surface atoms. A UV lamp was added during the measurement and with the lamp going on and off, the shift of surface current distribution was detected as in Fig. 7\n. The increase of current due to UV excitation can be found as high as 76%, if the mean detected current of each group is put to comparison. This is a clear indication of surface charges activation during the UV illumination.\n\nFig. 7The\n\nFrom these experiments, the introduction of CdS quantum dots on semiconductor surface could brings several advantages: first is the aforementioned down-conversion and anti-reflection; second is the population increase of electronic carriers at the surface because of UV excitation. Both effects can greatly improve the EQE (optical) and fill factor (electrical) of our traditional GaAs-based solar cells. One of the benefits that we did not examine in this article is the removable feature of these quantum dot layers. Once the quantum dots are degraded because of air exposure, they can be washed out by proper solvent and re-coat the device with another fresh quantum dot material. With this way, the device can be relieved of the reliability concerns that usually accompany with these quantum dots.\n\nSo far, our analysis is based on observation of individual experiments and dividing the improvement between down-conversion and anti-reflection effect. However, the nature of this hybrid design is more complicated than this ideal scenario. Especially when the anti-reflection effect intertwine with the down-conversion, and how to properly estimate the effectiveness of down-conversion becomes difficult. In our case, several tests were performed for quantum-dot only transmission, reflection and absorption. What we found is about 10% of the UV photons can be absorbed in a single pass through the quantum dots. Combining with the reflection data in Fig. 3(b) and the EQE data, approximately 50% of the short-circuit current enhancement in UV region can be attributed to down-conversion. The previous calculated numbers (11%) of Eq. (1) based on ideal case has to be cut in half. The quantum yield of the quantum dots is assumed to be 50% to 60%. If the yield can be raised, the down-conversion can take a larger part of Jsc enhancement.\n\nAnother issue raised is the emission wavelength of our quantum dots. Since 460nm is not particularly favorable in photo-generated carrier collection, longer wavelength quantum dots should be considered. However, if the direct band gap material is used, the absorption edge of the QD will be very close to the emission peak, and a large portion of visible spectrum becomes absorptive to the QD. Since the overall photo-generated carriers can be expressed as the summation of carriers generated by bulk and by down-converted photons, and the quantum efficiency of the bulk material is still much higher than that of the down-conversion, the overall power conversion efficiency is expected to drop. So if we are going to use the direct band gap quantum dots, staying at shorter wavelength should be a better choice. Another solution will be the indirect band gap material such as silicon. The indirect band gap material can have a much larger Stoke shift between the absorption edge and emission peak. We believe this indirect band gap QDs can have great potential for the hybrid cell in the future.\n\n4. Conclusion\n\nIn conclusion, we successfully combine CdS QDs layer with GaAs solar cell to form a highly efficient hybrid solar cell. It is noticeable that the CdS QDs layer can significantly enhance power conversion efficiency under air mass 1.5 global illuminations. The main mechanism of the enhancement can be attributed to photon down-conversion and antireflection. Consequently, the overall power conversion efficiency is enhanced by 18.9% and 2.7%, when compared to the cell without CdS QDs layer (GaAs II) and the cell with conventional ARC (GaAs III), respectively. A further UV only test ascertains the enhancement of PCE can be constant at 1.22 times and CAFM shows the increased surface charges leading to the improvement of the fill factor by 30%. We believe this technology shall be a great candidate for next generation of highly efficient photovoltaic devices.\n\nAcknowledgment\n\nThis work is founded by National Science Council in Taiwan under grant number NSC 99-2120-M- 006-002 and NSC-99-2120-M-009-007.

{"text": "Emissions Major Concern Of Mexico City's Asphalt Production Site\n\nAstec engineers were tasked with designing a plant that would maintain high production levels at a site elevation of 7,200 feet, using an aggregate supply containing seven percent moisture content.\n\n\"IT'S THE FIRST PLANT IN LATIN AMERICA WITH A V-PAC TEMPERATURE CONTROL SYSTEM.\" —Moises Esquivel, director of sales for Latin America and Caribbean, Astec\n\nWhen a municipality shuts down its own asphalt production facility because citizens living in adjacent neighborhoods complain of the emissions, equipment agent Ramon Garcia, owner of DIMAQ, knew he would have to rely on the expertise of a plant manufacturer to convince the government that all requirements could be met with the right design and modification of the asphalt production components required.\n\nIt's the first asphalt plant in Latin America with a V-Pac Stack Temperature Control System, according to Moises Esquivel, Astec's director of sales for Latin America and the Caribbean. The V-Pac controls stack temperature through use of V-flights and drum variable frequency drive. This feature allows a plant operator to make changes from a RAP mix design to a virgin mix design with reduced flight changes, while increasing drum efficiency in the process. The plant also features Astec's Phoenix Talon II low emissions burner that can be fired with either natural gas or diesel oil, with a combustion air blower silencer, which reduces excess noise during operation. It's capable of producing mix designs with up to 50 percent recycled asphalt pavement (RAP), and is also equipped with Astec's Green System capable of producing warm mix, which further reduces emissions by reducing the heat and fuel required during production.\n\nThe 250 TPH plant is specifically designed for high altitude, high moisture aggregate production.\n\n\"The complete plant is capable of maintaining production at an operating elevation of 7,200 feet and using an aggregate supply containing 7 percent moisture content,\" Esquivel says. \"Most asphalt producers in Latin America rate their asphalt plant production with a 3 percent moisture content; within the US it's 5 percent; and we rated this plant at a 7 percent because of the high moisture content in the aggregates due to the annual rainfall Mexico City receives.\"\n\nA UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY\n\nFor Garcia, the equipment agent who coordinated the plant transaction by working with Astec in addressing the specific needs of the city's asphalt and public works operations, the project presented a unique opportunity to help the city address its asphalt needs in a way that would enhance the entire quarry site.\n\n\"The plant we replaced worked and produced the mix the city needed, but it failed to meet the environmental concerns citizens demanded. That's why the city decided to shut it down three years ago,\" Garcia explains. \"It's a very unique location in the center of city. It used to be an active quarry with four operating asphalt plants. The quarry operation was shut down 20 years ago and older batch plants were shut down since then. Eventually the one remaining continuous drum plant in operation was replaced with another continuous drum plant, and that's the one officials shut down when the surrounding neighborhoods voiced their unhappiness.\"\n\nThat action forced the Mexico City government to rely solely on independent asphalt producers to support its paving crews, but the asphalt director and public works director continued to push city officials to consider investing in another plant that would supply a large portion of asphalt for the city of 20 million residents, who expect their roads be kept in good operating condition.\n\n\"I've sold Astec products (Roadtec pavers and Shuttle Buggies) for over 40 years, so I felt pretty confident their engineering people could design and build a plant that would meet the site restrictions and produce quality mix without adding unnecessary emissions to the area,\" Garcia says.\n\nThe site constraints are due to the fact that the city officials wanted to use three-fourths of the quarry location for park and recreation facilities since it is surrounded by residential neighborhoods.\n\nThe production issues, on the other hand, are directly related to the high moisture content and site elevation.\n\n\"It rains five months of the year and the aggregate stockpiles have a high moisture content that has to be dealt with,\" Garcia says. \"The elevation is another issue. The drum and baghouse components must account for the need to move more heated air to dry the aggregate in a high-altitude environment.\n\nThe Double Barrel Green System features an Astec Phoenix Talon II Low Emission Burner with an air intake silencer.\n\n\"Paving operations are conducted at night when streets can be shut down. They (asphalt and public works operations) wanted a 250 TPH that could produce the quantity of material required to complete a project between 12 and 4 a.m.\" he adds. \"This operation has three different and distinct operations throughout a 24-hour period. During the day much of the production is for patching work. Then the plant switches over to main paving projects by producing and stockpiling mix needed before the overnight work begins.\"\n\nAs Garcia points out, the new plant system allows operators to easily switch mix designs because of the automatic controls for drum rotation and the V-flights that produce a wider veil of material in the drum.\n\n\"I think the authorities involved in operating the plant, as well as the government officials who supported the acquisition of the plant, all support the advantages cutting-edge technology offers and are willing to investigate leading production and paving approaches, like warm mix and high-RAP,\" Garcia says. \"The plant produced approximately 500,000 tons during its first year (2017) of operation and I expect next year the demand will be much greater. They know they now have a green facility that reduces the emissions, and they will further explore increasing the use of warm mixes and high-RAP mixes to further promote an environmentally-friendly operation.\"", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "8ae10a14-5edd-435b-bc01-a5cf0807a926", "url": "https://www.mixequipmentmag.com/equipment/article/21105317/emissions-major-concern-of-mexico-citys-asphalt-production-site"}

There are many cases, for instance, where and elephant had some injury inflicted on bit by a man and years later attacked the man who had done it harm.\n\nBut elephants certainly do forget.

{"text": "Divorces involving current and retired members of the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps and Coast Guard often involve issues not found in non-military divorces. For example, in a military divorce, the most valuable marital asset is typically the military pension of one spouse.\n\nThere are two federal laws which principally govern the division of a military pension. These two laws are Section 1408 of Title 10 of the United States Code, known as the Uniformed Services Former Spouse Protection Act (\"USFSPA\") and Part 63 of Title 32 of the Code of Federal Regulations.\n\nFederal law authorizes each individual state to treat military pensions as marital assets and it further authorizes each state to divide military pensions in accordance with each state's laws regarding the division of marital assets, so long as the rules and limitations imposed by federal law are complied with. The rules and limitations are numerous and complex and in order to properly understand and comply with those rules, a divorce attorney handling a military divorce should be familiar with the applicable federal laws and experienced in handling military divorces.\n\nThe \"Ten Year Rule\"\n\nAn example of a commonly misunderstood concept is \"The Ten Year Rule.\" Often , the belief is that The Ten Year Rule requires military marriages to last ten years before a spouse is entitled to receive a share of the military pension. Still others believe that if The Ten Year Rule is satisfied, the spouse is automatically entitled to half (or some other percentage) of the member's pension.\n\nIn fact, the \"The Ten Year Rule\" deals only with the method of how a former spouse that is awarded a share of the service member's pension will receive those payments. Specifically, It entitles a spouse that was married for at least ten years while the member was on active duty to receive his or her share of the military pension directly from the Defense Finance and Accounting Service (\"DFAS\") as opposed to DFAS sending the entire monthly pension check to the service member and the service member then issuing payment to the former spouse.\n\nHowever, the Ten Year Rule has nothing to do with whether the spouse is entitled to a portion of the pension in the first place nor does it have anything to do with how much of the pension a former spouse will be entitled to.\n\nThe Survivor Benefits Plan\n\nAnother important aspect unique to military divorces is the Survivor Benefits Plan (\"SBP\"), which is an annuity that protects former spouses awarded a portion of the military pension in a divorce.\n\nWithout SBP coverage, when the service member dies, the military pension benefits end for the former spouse, unless SBP coverage is in effect. The right to SBP coverage is not automatic and it must be agreed to in writing or ordered by the court in writing. In addition, the former spouse that receives SBP entitlement in a divorce must submit a \"deemed-election letter\" within one-year of the final judgment in order to preserve their SBP rights.\n\nThe rules which govern Reserve Component military pensions and SBP benefits are different from those which govern regular military pensions and SBP benefits since the Reserve Component programs are significantly different from their active-duty counterparts.\n\nThe Servicemembers Civil Relief Act\n\nThe Servicemembers Civil Relief Act (\"SCRA\") is yet another federal law which may impact a military divorce. The SCRA provides protections for active duty service members by allowing them, under certain very specific circumstances, to put a hold on court proceedings (as well as other obligations) so that they can focus their full attention on their duties.\n\nOther Areas of Concern\n\nOther areas of concern in a military divorce include the former spouse's post-divorce health care insurance, which, depending on the length of marriage and military service, can be addressed through Tricare coverage, the Continued Health Care Benefit Program, group coverage through an employer or private coverage.\n\nAlthough no federal laws specifically address custody, parental responsibility, visitation or time-sharing issues in military divorces, these issues are often made more challenging because service members' obligations to their jobs require extra flexibility and creativity in creating parenting plans and time-sharing arrangements that will work for both parents as well as serve the best interests of the children.\n\nExperienced Military Divorce Attorney\n\nIf you are a service member or the spouse of a service member and you have been served with divorce papers it is very important that you consult with an attorney who is experienced in dealing with the various aspects unique to military divorces.\n\nAttorney David Caveda is familiar with the military due to his service for eight years as a Field Artillery officer in the U.S. Army Reserve. He attended regular army basic training at Fort Leonard Wood, Missouri in 1986, ROTC Advanced Camp at Fort Bragg, North Carolina in 1987 and Field Artillery Officer Basic Course at Fort Sill, Oklahoma in 1993-1994. He received his ROTC commission after completing his final ROTC semester while attending law school at the University of Florida in 1991 after completing previous ROTC requirements at the University of South Florida. He was honorably discharged from the reserves in 1999 and is a member of the Military Officers Association of America (\"MOAA\")\n\nAs an attorney, Mr. Caveda has over ten years of experience in representing service members and spouses in divorce and post-judgment enforcement and modification actions. As a member of the Military Committee of the Family Law Section of the American Bar Association, Mr. Caveda stays informed on the latest developments in this practice area.\n\nWe Can Help!\n\nIf you or someone you know needs legal assistance concerning a military divorce in Tampa, Tampa Bay, or Hillsborough County, Florida, contact us today by phone at (813) 463-0800 or by filling out our online form", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "f55fd2b0-65fd-4333-b5ad-71836c44c116", "url": "https://www.tampadivorceattorney.com/military-divorce/"}
{"text": "Philanthropic trust: Why it is broken and how to fix it\n\nCharitable organisations exist to empower civic society and to tackle urgent problems. It is then important to ask whether the charity sector is maximizing its possible impact and is equipped with the necessary tools and methodologies to work effectively. Here, we present an overview of the state of trust in the charitable sector and discuss possible ways to improve it.\n\nThis section is an attempt to present an overview of the state of trust in the charity sector. We realize that many factors can impact the amount of money people donate to charities and the time they spend volunteering. A combination of income, age, marital status, sex, religion, political party affiliation, and social position can significantly influence donating and volunteering habits. While we recognise the impact of these factors, they are not included within the scope of this article but I hope I will get the chance to elaborate extensively on them in future writings.\n\nThe Charities Aid Foundation (CAF), has published a report on giving behavior across the continents. The report indicates that Oceania is the continent which donates the highest amount of money on average (70% one-year score) followed by Europe (37%), Asia (33%), the Americas (25%), and Africa (18%). The report highlights that the Americas has seen a decline in donations since 2016.\n\nThe 2019 Edelman Trust Barometer revealed that trust decreased strikingly in the previous year. People have shifted their trust to their relationships with their employers. Globally, 75% of people trust their employers to make the right changes regarding major social and political events or facing crises, which is significantly more than NGOs (57%), business (56%), and media (47%).\n\nIn the United Kingdom\n\nnfpSynergy, a UK-based research consultancy published a report highlighting that trust in charities dropped from 65% in mid 2009 to 54% by the end of 2018. The methodology of nfpSynergy was based on an online survey of 1000 people representative of the Great Britain population by age, gender and social class.\n\nThe charity commission revealed that public trust in charities declined in both 2016 and 2018 in the UK with a dramatic fall already happening since 2014.\n\nThis growing mistrust is mirrored in the report UK Giving 2019 published by CAF UK giving 2019 which highlights that, the number of people in the UK regularly giving to charity has been declining since 2016. This report also indicates that trust in charitable organisations has fallen below 50%.\n\nIn the United States\n\nIn the United States, the situation seems to be different. \"After reaching record-breaking levels of giving in 2017, American individuals and organisations continued their generous support of charitable institutions in 2018\", said Rick Dunham, chair of Giving USA Foundation and CEO of Dunham + Company. But, Laura Otten, the director of the nonprofit center La Salle University, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania argues that \"much of that growth is fueled by mega gifts and fewer donors.\"\n\nAn in-depth study presented by the BBB Wise Giving Alliance in the U.S. indicates that while 73% of its survey's respondents acknowledged the importance of trust in a charity before making a donation, only 19% were willing to score their overall trust in charities above 90%, and just 10% were optimistic about the sector becoming more trustworthy over time. According to Edelman's annual Trust Barometer 2018, in the United States, trust in nonprofits dropped to 43% and lost 9 points from 2017 to 2018, down to 49%.\n\nIn 2016, market research firm Harris Interactive reported that \"media stories have made 33% of the public to think worse of charities.\"\n\nFrom causes of mistrust to earning trust\n\nSeveral factors contributed to the drop in charity trust but we will focus mainly on the impact of media representations of charities and, in particular, charity scandals and insufficient information on financial and intervention data disclosure in the charity sector.\n\nIn 2016, market research firm Harris Interactive reported that \"media stories have made 33% of the public to think worse of charities.\" In 2017, in an article published by the Commission on the Donor Experience (CDE), it is indicated that the media too often focuses on the minor poor performing charities rather than the excellent practices of most charities and argues that outlets tend to report on the charitable sector selectively.\n\nIn 2013, American newspaper The Tampa Bay Times identified and ranked America's 50 worst charities based on solicitation (i.e., fundraising) costs. CNN reported on the ranking too.\n\nA research article published in 2018 studied the effect of the news on donating behaviour. The study found that, three years after the news emerged, donors still remembered it. The majority of them reported that it negatively influenced their thinking (63%) and philanthropic donation behavior (62%). The study concludes highlighting that negative media stories about nonprofits can, potentially, damage a nonprofit's reputation as well as the reputations of other nonprofits or even of the sector as a whole, resulting in decreased financial donations.\n\nThis becomes even more evident when we look at the neurobiological understanding of the human brain's reaction towards negative news. As part of our survival mechanism, we pay attention to emotionally charged events and form long lasting memories of those events. This is how we are neurologically programmed to stay away from danger and feel content and aware. Unbiased media coverage of both poor and excellent charitable practices is then essential to help public awareness.\n\nThe importance of financial data disclosure\n\nApart from the influence of the media, it is important to ask what charitable organisations could have done differently to gain better trust, and how they project themselves in terms of data perception and disclosure.\n\nIn the United States, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) Form 990 has provided a good service to empower financial data disclosure preventing nonprofits from abusing their entitled tax-exempt status.\n\nHowever, its approach is to some extent selective as only certain nonprofits are required to provide a more comprehensive Form 990 (e.g. as hospitals and health care organizations).\n\nCharity navigator, an US-based charity evaluator, examines financial transparency of US charities using publicly available tax returns (IRS Form 990) filed with the IRS and information posted by charities on their websites. It has a selected pool and only audits organizations with more than US$1 million in their annual revenue.\n\nGuideStar, another charity evaluator, chooses a more inclusive approach and provides paid access to comprehensive data sets of forms that also include lower annual revenues filled by more than 400,000 public charities. The minimum threshold to be considered by GuideStar is US$ 150,000 in annual contributions.\n\nWhile these selective policies are essential to prevent financial misconduct in charities with access to big money, their selective approaches do not encourage the majority of charity organisations to disclose their finances to the public. This means that donors will have less or no access to the financial statements of charities that raise lower amounts of money, which can result in less assurance that charity money is being spent efficiently on their intended cause, dampening trust in charities that perform at smaller scales but effectively. This can also result in a vicious circle where no obligation to financial data transparency brings no obligation for self-reflection, making charities more prone to missteps.\n\nThe absence of or inefficiency in data understanding and transparency can rightfully play a role in feeding ineffectiveness and adding to the mistrust factors\n\nUnderstanding data in the charity sector\n\nThere is a substantial gap in record to examine the state of data collection and perception among advocacy groups, charities, and their stakeholders, which makes it difficult to come to a clear conclusion on the state of understanding data in the charity sector. The lack of comprehensive evidence suggests little is known about the state of charitable organisations in terms of effectiveness and competency. The absence of or inefficiency in data understanding and transparency can rightfully play a role in feeding ineffectiveness and adding to the mistrust factors.\n\nThe outcome of our own vetting framework shows that from all the charitable organisations vetted to date, a paltry 13% achieved good transparency scores regarding their output data and just 30% show a clear distinction between output, outcome, and impact in their results. These findings are in line with the current notion of data ambiguity in the field. The present concerns and considerations call for charity evaluation services with more inclusive policies to strengthen data understanding and disclosure at a worldwide scale with the aim of empowering the charity sector and its reliability.\n\nConclusion\n\nWe at Kinder, have closely examined the falling trend of trust in the charity sector in recent years. Concerned about this downward trend, we have focused on some of the main underlying causes that negatively affect the public trust in charities. Kinder's evaluation service is here to address mistrust and to provide solutions. We don't want to just verify charitable organisations around the world but also promote a widespread culture of data perception, collection, reflexivity and transparency as crucial requirements for earning trust and saving the longevity of philanthropic efforts.\n\nKinder takes an inclusive approach in evaluating and consulting charitable organisations across the globe. We believe this approach is a crucial element in the cultural movement within the charity sector that aims to promote the fight against discrimination.

We loved the food at their cafe Sugar, and the playground is fun on a sunny day with stunning views of the Auckland Harbour Bridge. The Edmonds Baking School has classes that you can book to attend, including ones for the kids in the school holidays. We didn't plan ahead on our 2 visits so still haven't gone on the sugar factory tour yet, but it is on our list to do!\n\nSugar Cafe at Chelsea Bay\n\nSugar bakery and eatery at Chelsea Bay has delicious food like burgers, french toast, egg dishes and of course you can't go past their baking which had slices, tarts, cakes, doughnuts and more that was all made freshly on site. For the kids there is also a small menu which has things like french toast, scrambled eggs on toast and sausage with chips. My favourite thing was their giant lamington, but I had to recruit some help to finish it as it was so large!\n\nSweet treat at Sugar at Chelsea Bay\n\nThe giant LAMINGTON\n\nPlayground\n\nRight outside the cafe is a partially fenced playground for kids to play on. The playground has a basket swing, little hut, slide, small rock climbing walk and sea saw. You can watch the kids from most seats in the cafe while they play outside, however as it only partially fenced for little ones you will still need to keep a close eye on them. There are some picnic tables that are close to the playground if you want to sit outside.\n\nChelsea Sugar Factory Tour\n\nYou can book in for a tour to teach you about Chelsea's history and see how raw sugar makes it way through the factory and in to your own pantry. You will get to do some taste tests of their custom made syrups which I think would taste amazing. The tours are one hour long and require a lot of walking so good mobility is required. You will need to wear something that covers your arms, legs and you must have closed toed shoes, unless you choose to go on their mini tour which is only 15 minutes long. The minimum age for the tour is 5 years old and children must be accompanied by adults as this is a working factory. Bookings are recommended, especially in the school holidays as these are often sold out.\n\nBright Pink hard hats and vests for the Chelsea Sugar Factory Tour\n\nEdmonds Baking School\n\nChelsea and Edmonds have come together to creat the Edmonds Baking School which is next to the Sugar cafe at the front of the factory. There are classes for children aged 8 years plus, teens and adults. As the classes are not always on each day, we recommend you check their baking classes availability on their website and book ahead. They also do birthday parties with a 2 hour cupcake and buttercream class for kids aged 8 years plus.\n\nEdmonds Baking School | Photo taken from the exterior by Auckland for Kids\n\nInteractive zone\n\nI liked the free Chelsea Bay Interactive Zone as I got to play a virtual baking game and make virtual cookies and a virtual cake, learning step by step. You get to find the ingredients, measure them to the right amount, mix them, bake them and ice them. Around the walls of the room are exhibits explaining the milling process of Chelsea sugar and history about the Chelsea company and baking in New Zealand.\n\nEntrance into the Interactive Zone\n\nVirtual baking station where you get to make the virtual cakes and cookies\n\nLearning how sugar is made in the Interactive Zone\n\nChesea Estate Heritage Park\n\nChelsea Sugar Factory is located at 100 Colonial Road in the large 39 hectare Chelsea Estate Heritage Park in Birkenhead on the North Shore of Auckland. There are lots of walking tracks around the park that wind through the bush valley and water. You can see tanekaha, kauri, manuka, kowhai, pohutukawa, relic hard beech and kanuka trees.

This was a small study on the effectiveness of Bexxar as a first line of treatment in patients with advanced disease, and more research on this approach is required before it can be approved by the FDA for widespread use.\n\nFollicular lymphoma is the second most common form of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and accounts for more than 20% of all cases. Follicular lymphoma is cancer of the lymph nodes, which are an important part of the immune system, the body's natural defense system against infection.\n\nContinued\n\nBexxar combines the antibody (tositumomab) with radioactive iodine and is administered through an infusion. The antibody stimulates the body's immune system to fight the cancer.\n\nThe drug was approved by the FDA in 2003 for the treatment of follicular, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in patients who have not responded to initial therapy with the drug Rituxan and who have relapsed following chemotherapy. But this is the first study to use the drug in previously untreated patients.\n\nNew First-Line Treatment for Lymphoma?\n\nIn the study, researchers tested the drug in 76 patients with advanced follicular lymphoma (stage III and IV) who had not yet been treated for their disease. The patients were given a one-week treatment with Bexxar and were followed for about five years.\n\nThe results appear in the Feb. 3 issue of The New England Journal of Medicine.\n\nResearchers found that 95% of the patients responded to the treatment; 75% had a complete disappearance of the signs of their cancer.\n\nAfter follow-up, the estimated five-year overall survival rate was 89%. Fifty-one percent of patients survived during this period with no evidence that their cancer continued to progress.\n\nContinued\n\nThe rate at which the cancer returned progressively declined over time: 25%, 13%, and 12% during the first, second, and third years after treatment, respectively.\n\nOf the 57 patients who had a complete remission, 40 remained in remission for four to seven years.\n\nResearchers say the toxicity or hazardous side effects of Bexxar were moderate, and none of the patients treated required transfusions or other serious therapy-related complications.\n\nResearchers say the results of this study support using the drug early in the treatment of follicular lymphoma. However, another study is needed to compare the safety and effectiveness of this approach vs. currently available therapies and in a larger number of patients.\n\nNo Lymphoma Cure Yet\n\nIn an editorial that accompanies the study, Joseph M. Connors, MD, of the British Columbia Cancer Center Agency, says the high response and remission rates with this treatment after four years of follow-up is encouraging.\n\n\"For a treatment accomplished in just a few weeks with modest toxicity, these results are especially impressive,\" writes Connors. \"But how impressive? Sufficient enough to claim that patients are being cured? No, relapses are still occurring in 4 percent to 5 percent of patients per year, even after five years. Sufficient to justify 131-I-tositumomab as a primary treatment for follicular lymphoma? No. Sufficient to justify additional clinical trials? Yes.\"\n\nConnors points out that the patients in the study were a highly select group of younger-than-average patients with a low-to-moderate disease burden, and the drug still needs more study before it's adopted as a first line of treatment for follicular lymphoma.", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "951cfd0b-5133-484f-9594-cfd5e088ac44", "url": "https://www.webmd.com/cancer/lymphoma/news/20050202/new-non-hodgkins-lymphoma-drug-passes-hurdle"}

It's easier for a criminal to exploit natural human inclination and tendencies than it is to discover new ways to hack software.\n\nFurthermore, cybercriminals are getting really, really good at their craft. They are doing a bang-up job of replicating existing workflows from trusted sources. \"Something we're seeing a lot of with our clients is wiring fraud,\" Phillips explains. \"One of their vendors gets hacked and sends a realistic-looking invoice. It looks legit so the company pays it. And then they find out that it was fake.\"\n\nThe latest in Cybersecurity Phishing Threats\n\nHere are 6 types of phishing scams that are keeping cybersecurity experts busy.\n\n1. Deceptive phishing\n\nThis threat is the most common one on the list. That LinkedIn request, the FedEx tracking email, the fictitious HR survey, and, of course, PayPal – all fall under this category, in which a bad actor impersonates a legitimate person or organization. With deceptive phishing, the perpetrator is counting on users to take specific action based on the email (click here, see attached) which then launches the attack.\n\n2. Spear phishing\n\nSpear phishing is a phishing scam that is well-executed and intentionally targeted. Whereas other phishing threats may rely less on investigation and more on the sheer volume of targets, with spear-phishing campaigns the name of the game is quality over quantity. If your organization is on a cybercriminal's spear-phishing radar, you can bet they are conducting extensive research to craft a credible and compelling narrative, designed to dupe their victims.\n\n3. CEO fraud\n\nWith this type of phishing threat, also referred to as whaling and business email compromise (BEC), the bad actor is playing the role of high-powered executive. In impersonating an executive, the perpetrator coerces employees to undertake actions, such as those designed to compromise data security, like unauthorized wire transfers or providing confidential tax information. Between May 2018 and July 2019, there was a 100% increase in this specific fraudulent activity.\n\n4. Vishing\n\nWhereas phishing refers to scams perpetrated via email, vishing is fraud by phone call, so named because the cybercriminals use a Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) server to conduct the fraudulent behavior. Oftentimes, they will disguise their phone number to make it look like it is coming from the target's region. Last August, the FBI and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) warned the public about an increase in vishing schemes, where the attackers targeted remote workers in an attempt to obtain their digital log-in credentials.\n\n5. Smishing\n\nLike vishing, smishing also relies on phone numbers for exploitation purposes. However, the cybercriminal will send malicious text messages, attempting to glean personal data or trick recipients into clicking on a dangerous link. Clicking on this link can give the attacker the ability to remotely control the victim's mobile device.\n\n6. Pharming\n\nIn a pharming attack, the cybercriminal redirects the victim to a fake website, intended to replicate the legitimate site they thought they were visiting. From this fake site, the intent is to obtain digital credentials, such as usernames and passwords. Pharming is often used as a precursor to online identity theft.\n\nIt's Time to Take Control of Your Cybersecurity This includes live and modular employee training, simulations, policy and procedure development, remedial training for simulation slip-ups, and resources for ongoing education.

{"text": "Cafe 454\n\nLi Yalin has taken care of the recent harassment by reporters through the Kohinata family, but the problem of being a superstar idol and being the center of attention wherever they go has not been resolved.\n\nFor everyone, they still want to enjoy life as ordinary female high school students, instead of living under the spotlight and the eyes of others every day.\n\nSince everyone has this idea, Li Yalin can only find a way to solve it for everyone. The best solution at the moment is undoubtedly the appearance of Ordinary Mirror.\n\nThese glasses are really an existence comparable to an artifact. As long as one wears it, one can instantly become an ordinary person.\n\nWhen Li Yalin handed out all the glasses, the four hottest super popular idol girls immediately became four ordinary nerds. If they are braided, they would definitely look like rural girls.\n\nThis change is really huge!\n\nThanks to Li Yalin's advance preparation, the coffee shop has been doing well recently, and Kowata Akane has acquired a lot of good stuff from the otherworld, so it's no problem to make these Ordinary Mirrors.\n\nHe originally planned to find a chance to give it to everyone in a while, but now… he can only send it out in advance.\n\nAfter receiving these magical glasses, everyone was naturally surprised. Especially dumb Yui, she was looking left and right in the mirror, as if she no longer recognized herself in the mirror.\n\nWith such awesome glasses, they really don't have to worry about going out anymore!\n\n\"Thank you senpai! I really like these glasses!\"\n\nThe cute and dumb Yui doesn't think much about it at all. After receiving this pair of magical glasses, her thoughts are still simple, she is very happy at the moment, nothing more.\n\nBut just because dumb Yui didn't think much doesn't mean the other girls do too. While it makes everyone happy to get such a pair of glasses, the magic of these glasses makes everyone feel very weird as well.\n\nWhy does it feels like these glasses… like the magical items that only appear in the novel and anime?\n\nIs there such a thing in the real world?\n\n\"Senpai this…\"\n\n\"You could say that I got these glasses by accident. I can't really explain to you guys about the specific origins. You only need to know the effect of this thing. Use it when you go out, but also pay attention not to let outsiders know, or there will be trouble.\"\n\nAfter taking out these glasses, Li Yalin knew that he had to come up with an explanation. Not everyone is as cute and stupid as dumb Yui, nor is everyone as considerate as Kohinata Yukari, knowing what to ask and what not to ask.\n\nThe most important thing is that Li Yalin has to explain some things to everyone. Although he doesn't mind giving these magical items to everyone, it is best not to let outsiders know about these things.\n\nAlthough… it doesn't matter even if it was exposed, using the witch's means to eliminate these effects is just a matter of minutes. It's just that Li Yalin doesn't want to get into trouble, so it's better to avoid things that can be avoided as much as possible.\n\n\"Eh? Are these glasses precious?\"\n\nWhen Li Yalin spoke, his expression was a little serious, and naturally the girls were also bluffed. Looking at MIO, she subconsciously grabbed the frame in her ear and wanted to take off the glasses and return them to Li Yalin.\n\nAnd dumb Yui, she is directly jumped up, open her mouth wide in an exaggerated manner.\n\n\"I can't say that it's precious, it's just that it's harder to find and not something that ordinary people can get. Although I'd like to explain it clearly to everyone, I don't know if I should explain it too much now. So let's leave it like this for now, and when I have the chance later, I'll explain everything.\"\n\nThe existence of the witch is not a big secret. It doesn't matter if these girls know about it. Li Yalin knows this very well. After all, he has also discussed it with Kowata Akane.\n\nBut even so, letting them know too much in a short period of time is not necessarily a good thing. So he also plans to do it step by step, and when the time is right, it is not too late to explain everything to everyone.\n\nAt this point, the more mature and calm MIO has already nodded her head, and Ritsu and Kotobuki ojou-sama is also silent, obviously agreeing with Li Yalin's statement.\n\nDumb Yui is the only one who hasn't figured out what happens, her face showed bewilderment.\n\n\"Explain? What does senpai want to explain?\"\n\nThis girl is really invincible in a sense…\n\nAlthough he really wanted tsukomi in his heart, after the glasses were sent out, this incident was temporarily over. With the support of the Kohinata family and the role of Ordinary Mirror, everyone can return to their old daily life in the next period of time.\n\nAs for Li Yalin, his focus is not on the entertainment industry for the time being. So after settling this matter, he left the office and went to EagleJump to check out the company's game progress.\n\nAs for Kohinata Yukari, she also had to go home first to prepare for the day off to entertain Li Yalin, which was a very important moment for her, and doesn't want any accidents.\n\nWith Li Yalin gone and Kohinata Yukari also gone, only four girls were left in the office, and naturally they gathered around and started their usual gossip (black tea) session\n\n\"Yalin senpai is really no ordinary person.\"\n\nAfter taking a sip of Kotobuki ojou-sama's hand-made black tea, Ritsu couldn't help but look at the sky and sigh.\n\nRegarding Li Yalin's identity, it is actually a topic that everyone usually likes to talk about. Although they have many contacts, for the few girls, he is undoubtedly still quite mysterious.\n\nEspecially after seeing Ordinary Mirror, this sentiment was further expanded in everyone's mind.\n\n\"I heard that this world is not as simple as we imagined. Many things that exist in legends also exist in the real world, but were hidden from ordinary people, without letting the public know about it.\"\n\nAs an ojou-sama from a wealthy family, Kotobuki Tsumugi undoubtedly knows a little bit more in some respects. Although she only knows a little bit, that doesn't stop her from talking about it at this time.\n\nAfter all, when girls talk in private, they can talk about anything.\n\n\"For real? That means…. Yalin senpai might be a strong Grand Mage or a super soldier? A mysterious assassin or something?\"\n\nKotobuki ojou-sama opened her mouth, which immediately aroused dumb Yui's interest. Her thoughts could not help but spread out, and even further reverie was generated.", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "5f2824f4-2121-4fb7-9ca3-7c67e605e110", "url": "https://rhinabolla.xyz/cafe-454/"}

This opportunity isn't just a way to get ahead in high school, it's a great way to learn the ropes of college life and have fun. You can pursue an associate degree at NIC before you graduate high school, or you can just take a few classes and earn some credits; the best option depends on where you want to go after community college.\n\nFor students at Lake City, we get the reduced credit rate at NIC, making each credit only $65, which is a great price for college credits that will transfer to instate universities. For students pursuing an out-of-state education, the credits often don't transfer, but they look good on your transcript. Taking college classes in high school prepares you for how going onto a four-year university will be. These are just some of the perks of dual enrolling. Jacob Keene told me, \"I love the chance to get ahead in high school by dual enrolling. I can get my associates here and it will transfer to Lewis and Clark.\"\n\nThe other end of the great opportunities of going to NIC during high school is that you get the feel of college. In my opinion, college is a lot more relaxed and focused on actually learning something. The professors at NIC don't care about you passing, they want you to really learn the information.\n\nAlso, you get to meet a new array of people. Being with lots of different age groups is a great way to open up your opinions and learn things you didn't in high school. In class discussions, you are opened up to different worldviews, and it is a more comfortable environment to talk about world issues. Getting different views and being able to talk openly is great.\n\nNIC has a lot of programs ranging from Aerospace to Outdoor pursuits. You can go into any program you would like at NIC, even as a junior in high school. NIC also provides a wonderful journalism program. Geoff Carr is the advisor of the program and he runs both a great printed paper and online paper. Check their Sentinel out.\n\nAt NIC, the Student Union Building is the hub of college life. The cafeteria is located there, and many students go there to study or just take a break from their busy schedules. The SUB is where I study a lot of the time with my friend Skylar. Skylar said, \"The SUB has a great vibe; everyone is there to do their own thing.\" Sometimes the SUB is filled with the sound of a piano being played by one of the NIC students.\n\nAll around, NIC is a great escape from high school and I highly recommend taking at least one class during your last two years of high school.

{"text": "AMERICAN EVIL\n\nBy Joe Giambrone\n\nWhat if everything printed this year about Donald J. Trump was 100% true, yet Hillary Clinton still wound up being the greater evil?\n\nWhat then America?\n\nIf the American people are to purchase a product, then do they not have a right to know just how much lesser this \"evil\" actually weighs versus the name brand?\n\nLike those seasonal Cadbury Cream Eggs that old familiar product has returned to the shelves: lesser evil, with more fat and toxins this year than ever. This repackaged, re-branded item is what many Americans claim to want every four years, the only thing they ever want or care about politically, and they attack those who refuse to purchase it. It's rather like a Black Friday zombie frenzy descending on Walmart, but we are told by TV that this is \"democracy.\" It's not. It's oligarchy with bread and circuses.\n\nThe so-called \"lesser evil\" political philosophy is the only political philosophy these people seem to comprehend, but the core of the concept is overlooked. Their candidate of choice will admittedly commit evil acts. Do they not want to know what this alleged lesser evil entails?\n\nSeems like self-deception is intrinsic to supporting this little house of cards. Perhaps if the phrase was amended to \"evil but possibly lesser,\" which is in fact more accurate, the public would spend a few seconds thinking about it when these Novembers inevitably roll around.\n\nIs a nuclear holocaust \"evil?\"\n\nI suppose that's the crux of the debate we face today. One of those big two evil candidates has repeatedly, and irrationally, tried to provoke hostilities against nuclear-armed Russia, as part of some unstated agenda: the real agenda that has been torching the Middle East for decades. Wars of western conquest, which turned millions into hamburger, didn't just happen by themselves. Certain interests wanted to dismantle the oil-rich nations that considered themselves independent of Washington and the EU. The chaos of failed states was preferred to organized regimes that could form an independent bloc or fight back in any way.\n\nAccording to Hillary R. Clinton, we should all be frothing at the Russians, and at Vladimir Putin for some set of vague claims without the substance that evidence would provide. Hillary and the Democratic National Committee were caught bloody-handed stealing the 2016 Democratic Party primary election from Bernie Sanders. Fraud. The only response she has mustered is the single word \"Putin.\" Yeah, sure: Putin did it. Repeated so often the word has lost all meaning here in the states, but abroad these quite undiplomatic slights do not pass unnoticed.\n\nThe Russians unveiled their next generation ICBM, \"Satan 2,\" capable of wiping out the central east coast of America, or all of France, or the UK, or most of California. You get the idea, but does Hillary Clinton?\n\n\"They're getting more sophisticated thanks to Russian imports. To have a no-fly zone you have to take out all of the air defense, many of which are located in populated areas. So our missiles, even if they are standoff missiles so we're not putting our pilots at risk you're going to kill a lot of Syrians… So all of a sudden this intervention that people talk about so glibly becomes an American and NATO involvement where you take a lot of civilians.\"\n\nIn the name of protecting civilians HRC wants to kill a lot of civilians and attack Russian-supplied air defense systems, and Russian military personnel of course. The fraud that Hillary Clinton and the interests she represents care in any way about dead Syrian civilians is laughable on its face. US foreign policy has never, ever been based upon protecting the lives of foreign nobodies. To believe such a fairy tale would require complete, absolute historical ignorance. But then again we're talking about the American public.\n\nHow \"Evil\" is Hillary Clinton already?\n\nAmerican corporate media refuses to call US war crimes war crimes. One can be impeached for a blowjob, but not for killing Nazi-level numbers of foreigners. There is no death count too high for the US Congress not to condone, if not to encourage.\n\nUS foreign policy has never, ever been based upon protecting the lives of foreign nobodies. To believe such a fairy tale would require complete, absolute historical ignorance. But then again we're talking about the American public.\n\nHillary Rodham Clinton has already played an instrumental role in the mass murders of approximately two million people, give or take. The Third Reich didn't bother with accurate tallies of its victims either. This figure shocks self-styled \"liberal\" Americans so thoroughly that they simply refuse to believe it.\n\nClinton, as Senator, not only voted for an illegal war on Iraq (command responsibility), but she told \"weapons of mass destruction\" lies, selling the fraud to Democrats (lying to Congress). Estimates of Iraqi casualties range from half a million to a million and a half. The carnage continues to this day, and Crimes Against the Peace attribute responsibility for all the evil that results from initiating a war of aggression. This is codified in the UN Charter, and that makes Hillary Clinton also an international war criminal, just like Bush, just like Cheney. The hypocrisy of those who condemned Bush and yet joyfully cast a vote for HRC is staggering (yet commonplace).\n\nThat was only one war. As Secretary of State Clinton took on even more responsibility for international crimes, notably the assault on Libya, another war of aggression.\n\nAs the Russians noted, there was never any permission to bomb ground targets and help Al Qaeda linked rebels take over the country.\n\n\"We're witnessing a large number of violations of the resolutions of the UN Security Council. Over the last few days, there have been reports of the NATO air force bombing civilian targets, including hospitals… This is an unacceptable situation; the United Nations Security Council did not authorize any such thing. Attempts to justify what's happening by claiming that the coalition does not go beyond the mandate are insufficient.\"\n\n-Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov\n…\n\n\"Regime change\" is a war crime, not an item on a menu for neocons to simply order up. Between 10 and 30,000 Libyans were massacred in the NATO-assisted destruction of Libya. Hillary Clinton displayed a gloating psychosis at the climax of the bloodletting.\n\nOnto Syria, with a current corpse count of 470,000. What was Hillary Clinton's role? Seymour Hersh's reporting contrasts against the endless lies of politicians:\n\n\"A highly classified annex to the report, not made public, described a secret agreement reached in early 2012 between the Obama and Erdogan… The annex didn't tell the whole story of what happened in Benghazi… 'The consulate's only mission was to provide cover for the moving of arms,' the former intelligence official, who has read the annex, said. 'It had no real political role.'\"\n\nHillary Clinton, as Secretary of State, was deeply involved in this covert \"regime change\" plot, and the sequential wars resulting from it. To this day she insists on continuing the plot to overthrow Bashar Al Assad, the elected President of Syria.\n\nDuring her husband's administration another half-million Iraqi children were killed as a result of US imposed sanctions on medicine and water filtration components. That UN death toll figure was deemed \"worth it\" by Madeleine Allbright in one of the most shocking news clips of the modern age. This unindicted yet confessed mass murderer campaigns openly for Hillary Clinton.\n\nThere are other flash points where Hillary Clinton had a role, Haiti and Honduras for example. Scandals and atrocities have been reported, but this does not faze her supporters, nor most Americans who care nothing about the illegitimate actions of the US empire abroad.\n\nSo Donald Trump's a pig, and the free world must play pretend that Hillary R. Clinton is not a proven and dangerous war criminal. Hollywood leads the charge and attacks dissentersWhat will it take to bring America to live according to its own propaganda?REMEMBER: ALL CAPTIONS AND PULL-QUOTES BY THE EDITORS, NOTTHE AUTHORS.\n\n2 comments\n\nGui RochatNovember 5, 2016 - 12:47 pm\n\nWhat is remarkable in these presidential elections is that the Democratic party is the one of the establishment, securely anchored in Wall Street, the permanent government and the boardrooms of major corporations. The attacks by the Republicans are but arrows that veer off and are deflected easily. Despite the Trump fortune, this is the true spectacle of a class war, because he represents exactly the kind of what is called the working-class red-neck population resisting the deep exploitation that is meted out to them. In fact Palin and Trump can easily be compared in so far that both make the most appalling blunders, but they are genuine, while Clinton is not. Their efforts will wash away in the avalanche of brutal criticism against them as has happened with the genuine though again appalling tea party. But make no mistake, this kind of populist revolt will persist and become stronger over time till it reaches unconquerable power.\n\nWhat is remarkable about the US is that the bourgeois majority (and that includes of course the establishment) is so very contemptuous of what is called the red neck (and most exploited) section of US society. Whether it is reverse desublimation by trying to confirm one's success in the capitalist USA or a fear of having traces of the same ideas as being held by those groups (that factually are living at the underbelly of US society), it has become a sustained hypocrisy that supports the oppressive status quo. It is not in the least backed by the large number of pseudo-intellectuals that need to use psychological pressures where their intellect fails and among those can be counted most of the media and the political flunkies. The average under-educated person often strikes with her/his ideas exactly the sore spot of a failing system and it was not those who gave rise to fascism (as being feared now by the so-called intelligentsia), but the petty-bourgeoisie in Europe, half-educated and striving to belong to the successful bourgeoisie. These are caught within the trap set by the establishment, dreaming of monetary blessings, security and the fake rewards of a lifetime dedicated to hard work and obedience, a picture very evident as established for a long time now within the capitalist US. It is a large majority lamed by propaganda in education and by daily media disinformation and forms the drag against incisive reform. It is not the red necks that are counter-revolutionary but the majority of those who go along with what they hear and see regardless of it being a bundle of untruths. The bourgeois conformist masses are in essence quite conservative though driven by guilt to pretend to support liberal causes. That guilt is propagandistically induced so that they will not rebel against their own dismal fate as captives to capitalist ends. Such a servile society will be a guarantee for sustaining the status quo, while the rebellious 'obnoxious' red necks could well be revolutionaries in a future reversal of fortune for the reigning classes despite their constricted views on liberal causes", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "5514aa13-e450-49b7-b4ba-0612e7ba84d0", "url": "http://www.greanvillepost.com/2016/11/04/american-evil/"}

{"text": "Discord TTS Command [Text-to-Speech]\n\nDiscord, as we all know quite well, is a Voice over Internet Protocol, group messaging, video calling, and communication platform that brings people closer from the world over! Its overall appeal lies in the fact that it is accessible to all, can be customized, can have different channels and private servers, and more!\n\nThe way Discord works is simple. You create a server once you have the Discord client app added to your device. Then, you can customize this server by adding your friends via invites. You can also create channels for specific topics such as gaming, music, arts, literature, and more!\n\nToday, we are set to discuss the Discord TTS command. If you're unfamiliar with this feature, we recommend that you give this article a good read!\n\nWhat is the Discord TTS command?\n\nThe Discord TTS or text to speech command is a method of converting written text to speech for your fellow Discord mates. It can not only be used for fun but has some functional aspects as well. Today's article is all about this feature and how you can access it on your Discord server.\n\nEven if you aren't necessarily on Discord, in cases where you need to send audio but don't have a mic, text to speech can aid you in quite a few ways. The Discord Text to Speech bot is a program that will connect and work on any device including PCs, laptops, and smartphones!\n\nYou can easily get the bot to read out text-based documents or even PFDS! That makes it quite a versatile option! Bots can be used for serious applications such as for any user who has visual impairments and requires the content to be in a speech format. However, in most cases, the Discord TTS command is a great way to have some fun!\n\nThe Discord text to speech feature is accessible to all Discord users! However, the only thing you need to make sure of is that you go to your settings and enable this feature before you begin. The cool thing is that as long as it is allowed, you can simply add a slash before your message and it will be converted to TTS.\n\nIt applies to both sides; in case your TTS command is not enabled, you can't send any audio speech and if your user's TTS is disabled, they won't be able to hear your messages! So, it is vital to make sure the command is enabled.\n\nHow to enable the Discord TTS command?\n\nAs we mentioned before, this is accessible to all users regardless of their devices. That's why, for today, we will be walking you through step by step so you know how to enable TTS for Discord. However, the process is slightly different for Mac OS and Windows users, so both will be outlined below for your ease!\n\nHere is how you can utilize Discord text to speech for Windows OS:\n\n1. Your first step will be to launch your Discord app and go to the settings. Here, you will see the settings icon and you can click on it.\n\nOpen Discord Settings\n\n2. Next, once you are at the settings, search for \"Text and images\" option and click on it.\n\nGo to text and images\n\n3. Here, you will find \"Text Box\" option, just enable and it will allow you to use slash commands in the text box.\n\nGo to text and images\n\n4. Now, go to any server and type \"/tts\" and Discord will automatically detect it as a command and will ask you to enter your message.\n\nWrite TTS command\n\n5. When you send that message, the other users will simply see it like a normal message but they can hear it by clicking on it or by going to more options and clicking on \"Speak message\".\n\nSpeak Message\n\nWe would recommend this as an extra but important last step!\n\nTTS command notifications\n\nIf you do not enable notifications for TTs command, you might miss out on it if you are away. The notification is what will alert you to the message in the first place. Open the app settings and then look for the notifications button. Click on this and scroll down till you get to the TTS command notifications. After this, just turn them on and you're good to go!\n\nThe important part comes here when you have to choose between 3 different scenarios or options!\n\nFor all channels\n\nWhen you choose to enable this text to speech feature for all channels, it means that no matter the number of channels, every user will be able to hear your messages regardless of which channel they're on. So, it essentially applies to your entire server. This is a popular setting that people with visual impairments will opt for.\n\nNever\n\nAs the name suggests, this is pretty much disabling the TTS command on discord for all servers and channels. Text will never be translated into speech that can be heard aloud. It will not activate even if you type the //tts command.\n\nFor only the current channel in use:\n\nIn our opinion, this option is the perfect middle ground to opt for. You might be more interested in the happenings of one specific channel and that means you want to be aware of everything! That's why for this option, you can easily allow text to speech to go through. Only the users in that specific channel will be able to hear any messages.\n\nThis last option is also beneficial if you wish to step away from the Discord server and engage in some other activity. It will allow your users to send a voice message easily which you can hear even if you aren't reading the messages.\n\nThe option that you choose to select will depend on what your requirements are as a user so it will be different for everyone!\n\nNow that you know precisely how to access the TTS command for Windows, let's look at how to enable this for Mac users as well!\n\nWhile it is not that different, there are 2 unique ways you can use the Text to speech feature for Mac. So, let me walk you through the steps!\n\nYour first step will be to launch the Discord app on your Mac device.\n\nAfter this, you will scroll down the screen and search for the icon for settings. It will be in the shape of a gear.\n\nYou will click on the option that reads Notifications.\n\nGo down the options and search up the option for Text to Speech Notifications.\n\nHere is when you decide whether you are turning it on for all channels or just the one that is currently being used. This is a crucial aspect as it will set what channels will hear your audio messages.\n\nIn case you do not want to utilize this option, you can also set it to Never from here. This will not enable this feature to be used.\n\nThis has been the first method that you can opt for to turn on the discord TTs command for Mac. However, there is another way you can work this as well.\n\nHere are the steps to accomplish that:\n\nFirst, you will choose the option for Text & Images.\n\nThen you will go to the option that reads, Allow playback & usage of the /tts command. Make sure to turn the toggle switch on for this!\n\nOnce you turn this on, you will be able to easily but for this method, you will have to type a slash followed by tts command at the beginning of your message or text. Add a space after this command as well and then type whatever you wish.\n\nOne thing to keep in mind is that in case your user's TTS command is not enabled on their servers, then they will not hear the audio! They will see the text alone.\n\nFor example, once Discord is open, you can go to your channel to send something.\n\nThen, write: /tts at the beginning of the message, write Hello after space, and press enter.\n\nThe slash and tts will not appear, all your users will see and hear is your message! It will also address your username along with the message. And that's it!\n\nConclusion\n\nIf you've ever had your hands full and you wanted to easily access Discord functions, now you can with this handy guide on everything about the Discord TTS command! It is super simple to access and as long as you follow the steps we've listed above; it shouldn't be too hard for you to utilize fees by advertising and linking to Amazon.com", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "5c3c83c7-05b4-48f6-944f-4915b04c111d", "url": "https://www.technochops.com/discord/3078/discord-tts-command/"}

{"text": "The problem with race-based scholarships\n\nTwo private schools in the UK made headlines recently when they turned down philanthropist Sir Bryan Thwaites's £1m (US$1.32m) scholarship donation for white boys from impoverished families.\n\nDulwich College and Winchester College reportedly feared that it would break equality laws.\n\nAccording to The Times, Thwaites, 96, attended both schools on scholarships. He had wanted white British boys from disadvantaged homes to benefit because studies showed they did worse at school than almost every other ethnic group.\n\nBritish musician Stormzy is funding British black students to study at the University of Cambridge under the Stormzy Scholarship. The year 2019 marks the scholarship's second year of running.\n\nMeanwhile, last year, American tech entrepreneur Arlan Hamilton set up a scholarship to help black African or Caribbean students from disadvantaged backgrounds to study at the University of Oxford.\n\nThwaites reportedly argued: \"If Cambridge University can accept a much larger donation in support of black students, why can't I do the same for underprivileged white British? Winchester said it would harm its reputation by accepting my bequest, but in my opinion, it would gain enormously by being seen to address what is the severe national problem of the underperforming white cohort in schools.\"\n\nThe Times notes that under the Equality Act, positive discrimination, where someone is given preferential treatment because they have a specific characteristic, is generally unlawful. They note that \"positive action\" is permitted for efforts aimed at encouraging someone to overcome a disadvantage attributed to their race or other protected characteristic.\n\nA spokesman for Winchester College was quoted saying: \"Acceptance of a bequest of this nature would neither be in the interests of the school as a charity nor the interests of those it aims to support through its work. Notwithstanding legal exceptions to the relevant legislation, the school does not see how discrimination on grounds of a boy's colour could ever be compatible with its values.\"\n\nMeanwhile, a spokesman for Dulwich College reportedly said: \"The community at Dulwich is proudly diverse, both socio-economically and ethnically, reflecting our location. Bursaries are an engine of social mobility and they should be available to all who pass our entrance examinations, irrespective of their background.\"\n\nSchools condemned for their decision\n\nFor anyone who would like to read my full argument on the proposed bursaries for White British boys : Guilt makes fools of the exam-passing classes | Trevor Phillips | Standpoint \n\nTrevor Phillips, former chairman of the Equality and Human Rights Commission, slammed the decision of both schools for turning down the bursary.\n\nWriting in The Daily Mail, he said: \"Sir Bryan's wish to promote social mobility through a number of scholarships is wholly justified. Nor is there anything unorthodox about wanting to provide financial backing to pupils from certain ethnic groups which face disadvantages in the system.\n\n\"After all, the rap star Stormzy has established a number of scholarships exclusively for black students at Cambridge University. Other charities have done the same.\"\n\nHe added: \"Sir Bryan's proposal was certainly not illegal under current equality legislation. As one of the authors of the 2010 Equality Act in my then role as head of the Equality and Human Rights Commission, I can state categorically that in circumstances where a racial group suffering disadvantage is white, then there is no bar on doing for them exactly what we would do for black and ethnic minority groups.\"\n\nPhillips said the Equality Act is not the judicial preserve of people of colour, but a measure that aims to bring fairness for all.\n\nNeeds-based versus race-based scholarships\n\nRight decision, wrong reasons.\n\nIt's not unlawful to setup a fund to address systemic disadvantage on grounds of race but white working class boys are disadvantaged by class not b/c they are white. \n\nWere both schools right in turning down the bursary? Are race-based scholarships a form of affirmative action or a sign of racism?\n\nTwitter users voiced mixed reactions.\n\nOne user said: \"Right decision, wrong reasons. It's not unlawful to set up a fund to address systemic disadvantage on grounds of race but white working class boys are disadvantaged by class not b/c [because] they are white.\"\n\nAnother user opined: \"Is equality gone mad. Surly [surely] helping any fellow human being is courageous\" while another said: \"Ok for Stormzy to set up scholarships for black boys but doing same for poor white boys is racist? How come? Poor white boys most deprived group educationally\".\n\n\"Most people are completely missing the point over the #OKtobeWhite private schools donation. It is private schools that are the problem, they need to be abolished,\" said another user.", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "87defd42-1736-440c-bfc3-869a0e4982e1", "url": "https://dev.studyinternational.com/news/raced-based-scholarships/"}

{"text": "ENThis article surveys the sources of the eighteenth century Jewish censuses in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. A large manuscript collection is stored in the Lithuanian State Historical Archive. Prevailing historiography on Jewish census sources unveils that these were never studied in their complex. This article describes the preserved census sources, their nature and the way the data are presented. It also raises several important questions for interpreting the data: how many Jewish censuses were carried out in the eighteenth century Grand Duchy of Lithuania and which of these is reliable for historical demography and family research. We conclude that the dates of reported for Jewish censuses in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania which appeared in historiography do not reflect the real situation: there were only two censuses, in 1764-65 and 1784. What is known in historiography as the second census of 1775 was not implemented. The poll-tax lists from 1775 are only an edited copy of the 1764-5 census documents, prepared in accordance with the territorial and population losses after the First Partition of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth and because the poll-tax was made higher. Comparing the data of 1764-65 and 1784 shows that the latter are unreliable, not corresponding to the real situation, and demographically impossible and misleading. The 1784 census data are problematic for research on Jewish historical demography. Historiography based on research of the fragments of the 1784 census should be critically revaluated.

{"text": "Ayurveda and the City: Five Tips for Thriving in an Urban Environment\n\nLet's face it—regardless of where you live, stress will be a part of your life. But city dwellers often experience a particular brand of stress that emerges from sensory overload, a sense of compressed time, and the pressure to go, go, go! As a longtime yoga practitioner and teacher, I arrived in New York City with tools to work with, and a move from my tiny studio sublet in NoLita to Brooklyn calmed me down and gave me more space. But, after a difficult injury and recovery, the city felt like my nemesis—little things like grocery shopping became a major feat. Even when you're not dealing with a particular challenge like this, your energy and enthusiasm can wane when the body and senses are frazzled.\n\nAyurveda offers self-care routines for supporting, nourishing, and rejuvenating mind, body, and spirit. Here are five tips that are beneficial for everyone, but especially city dwellers.\n\nEat lunch. Who knew that eating a good lunch could make such a difference in your life? Like many New Yorkers I know, I used to skip lunch all the time. It seemed so much more convenient: I could power through my day at work, grab a yogurt or energy bar, keep on cruising through, and save up my calories for a good dinner. But Ayurveda teaches that we should eat our main meal in the middle of the day, when the digestive fires are at their strongest. Once I adopted this natural habit, I found that my body and brain felt more nourished, and I was able to be more effective and focused throughout the day.\n\nTake in the sky, trees, flowers, and natural light. So many urbanites spend their days traveling underground and working eight-plus hours in buildings with temperature control and fluorescent lighting. Ayurveda teaches that it's our nature to bewith nature. Getting outdoors to take a walk in a nearby park, sit in a garden, or just inhale fresh air can improve our outlook, calm the nervous system, and bring greater clarity. If I have errands to run, I often book appointments or look for establishments near a park or along the waterfront. It's not always the closest place I could go, but it gives me a reason to walk through Central Park with my dog after a vet visit, or take in the Battery Park waterfront after a meeting with my accountant. Along with setting aside larger blocks of time to connect with nature, find a few minutes throughout your day to simply gaze at a tree outside your window, or to cultivate houseplants at the office.\n\nDrink warm water. In Ayurveda, the key to good health is through the care of the digestive system. This requires a good look at the foods and liquids we consume. Water consumption has always been a hot topic, and I've worked with many clients who thought they were doing their bodies a favor by drinking glass upon glass of ice-cold water. That's easy to do on those sweltering summer days in the city, or while you're waiting for your meal at a restaurant. But the digestive system is hot by nature, and we need these acids to thrive in order to properly digest and assimilate our food. Ayurveda suggests sipping warm water during a meal to aid digestion, and not chugging a glassful of water prior to eating as it cools down the agni (digestive fire).\n\nTakea loving-kindness commute. It's rush hour, and your subway car is packed. Or someone just grabbed that cab that you were desperately hailing, and you're already late. This isthe opportunity to put meditation and deep breathing into practice. Every conscious slow breath will activate the parasympathetic nervous system, also known as the relaxation response. As you exhale and allow your body to soften rather than stiffen, you'll feel more open to those around you and begin to realize that we're all just trying to get somewhere together.\n\nPay attention to your feet. In Ayurveda, a hugely important self-care practice consists of a daily self-massage, or abhyanga, using oil. If you don't have time to massage your whole body, focus on your feet, which get a daily workout pounding the city sidewalks. As a former ballet dancer, I was familiar with self-massage (our feet don't really fit into those pointe shoes as gracefully as one might think) but the addition of warm oil was a game changer. Sesame oil is the recommended choice for cool weather, and coconut oil for warm. After a long day of hustle and bustle, a foot rub with warm oil will relieve stress and relax you before bed. Ideally, start your day this way, too, and take on the city feeling balanced and nurtured from head to toe.\n\nKristen Rae Stevens, E-RYT, trained at Kripalu as an Ayurvedic Health Coach and Ayurvedic Yoga Specialist.

{"text": "Refrigerating a turkey\n\nRefrigerating a turkey is not difficult if you follow these steps. First, remove the giblets from the cavity. Wash the turkey thoroughly under cold running water. Remove any remaining fat from the skin. Place the turkey breast side down on a cutting board. Using a sharp knife, cut along either side of the backbone until it breaks. Pull the backbone away from the meat. Turn the turkey breast side up and place the neck end toward the tail end. With the tip of the knife, press firmly against the bone where the neck meets the body. Cut around the bone to separate it from the meat. Repeat this process on the other side. Next, using poultry shears, cut off the wing tips. Then, using poultry shears again, cut between the drumstick and thigh to separate the two pieces. Finally, pull the leg bones away from the thighs. Discard the bones. Rinse the turkey well under cold running water. Pat dry with paper towels. Cover loosely with plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight. The next day, remove the turkey from the refrigerator about 1 hour before roasting. Preheat\n\nDefrost in the fridge\n\nDefrosting in the refrigerator is not recommended because the cold air tends to dry out the food. It is better to defrost frozen food in the freezer.\n\nShelf-life of thawed turkey\n\nThawing frozen turkeys is not difficult. Thawing frozen turkeys takes about 4 hours in the refrigerator. Once thawed, store the turkey in the refrigerator until ready to eat. Refrigerate cooked turkey within 2 days after cooking.\n\nFreezing a turkey\n\nTo freeze a turkey, you need to remove the giblets from the cavity and place the bird breast side down on a cutting board. Remove any remaining fat from the skin using paper towels. Place the turkey in a roasting pan and pour 2 cups of cold water into the bottom of the pan. Cover the turkey loosely with foil and refrigerate overnight. In the morning, preheat the oven to 325 degrees F. Remove the turkey from the refrigerator 30 minutes prior to baking. Rinse off the water in the roasting pan and pat dry with paper towels. Rub the surface of the turkey with 1 tablespoon of butter. Sprinkle the top of the turkey with salt and pepper. Bake until the juices run clear when pierced with a knife (about 3 hours). Let stand 15 minutes before carving.\n\nPreserving a defrosted turkey\n\nDefrosting a frozen turkey is not difficult but it does take time. It takes about 4 hours to thaw a frozen turkey. Once thawed, remove the skin from the breast meat and discard. Remove the neck and giblets from the body cavity. Rinse the bird under cold running water and pat dry. Place the bird breast side down on a cutting board. Using poultry shears, cut along each side of the backbone to remove it. Cut off the wings at the joint. Pull the wing tips back toward the body. Cut between the drumsticks and thighs to separate them. Discard the bones. Turn the bird breast side up and place it on a rack set over a rimmed baking sheet. Refrigerate uncovered until completely cool, about 2 hours. Cover loosely with plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight.\n\nIdentifying bad or rancid meat\n\nRancidity is a term used to describe the off-flavor that develops in meats during storage. It is caused by oxidation, which occurs when oxygen reacts with fats and proteins in the meat. Oxidation produces compounds called aldehydes, ketones, and acids. These chemicals give meat a rotten egg smell and taste. Rancid meat is unsafe to eat because it contains bacteria and other harmful microorganisms.\n\nStore in the meat drawer\n\nStore in the refrigerator. Meat is delicate and needs to be stored in the coldest part of the fridge. This is where the meat drawer is located. It is the perfect place to store meats because it is the coolest part of the fridge.\n\nPackaging\n\nPackaging is the process of wrapping items in plastic, paper, or other materials. It is used to protect products from damage during shipping and storage. Packaging is usually done using machines called packaging lines.\n\nUsing ice-filled coolers for storage\n\nIce-filled coolers are great for keeping beverages cold. However, if you store items such as fruits and vegetables in these coolers, they could spoil. This is because the air inside the cooler does not circulate well. It is better to put fruits and vegetables in a refrigerator instead.\n\nOther FAQs about Turkey which you may be interested in.\n\nTurkey is a bird that is native to North America. It was domesticated from wild turkeys living in the eastern United States. Today, turkey meat is widely eaten around the world. Turkey is a popular source of protein in many countries because it is low in fat and cholesterol. Turkey is also a good source of vitamin B12 and iron. Turkey is usually cooked whole, but ground turkey can be used in recipes. Turkey breast is leaner than dark meat and contains less fat and calories. Turkey is available frozen, canned, smoked, and dried. Turkey is also available in different varieties such as organic, free range, and heritage breeds.\n\nWhat happens If you eat expired turkey?\n\nExpired meat is not safe to consume. It could lead to serious health problems such as food poisoning. In case you accidentally eat expired meat, you should immediately seek medical attention.\n\nThe shelf-life\n\n1) If you buy a product from a store, you can not know how long it has been stored. It could be months, years, or even decades. 2) You can check the expiration date on the package. But if you bought it online, you can not see the expiration date.\n\nHow to store raw turkey?\n\nTurkey needs to be stored properly to ensure safe consumption. It is important to keep the meat away from any other food items such as eggs, milk, cheese, and breads. Turkey should always be stored in a refrigerator. This will help to maintain its quality and prevent spoilage. Refrigeration helps to slow down the growth of microorganisms and bacteria. It also prevents the formation of off odors and flavors. In addition, refrigerated meat retains moisture better than frozen meat.\n\nFreezing pre-stuffed turkey\n\nFreezing pre-stuffed turkeys is a great way to save money and time. It is important to freeze the stuffing separately from the bird. This allows the stuffing to stay moist while freezing. Also, if you are using a frozen stuffing, you can thaw it overnight in the refrigerator and reheat it in the oven.\n\nCheck for the best-by date\n\nChecking the best-by date is important because if the product is past its expiration date, it could become harmful to health.\n\nHow long does the turkey last?\n\nTurkey lasts about 3 days if stored properly. It is recommended to store it in the refrigerator. To extend the life of the turkey, wrap it tightly in aluminum foil and place it in the freezer. Once frozen, remove the turkey from the freezer and thaw it overnight in the fridge. This process helps preserve the flavor and texture of the meat.\n\nFreezing thawed turkey\n\nFreezing thawed turkey is not recommended because it could lead to bacteria growth. It is better to discard the meat after thawing.\n\nWhat happens If you cook bad meat?\n\nIf you cook bad meat, it will not taste good. It will smell bad and if you eat it, you will get sick.\n\nCan you get sick from bad turkey?\n\nYes, if you eat raw meat that has been sitting around for a long period of time, it could potentially become contaminated with bacteria. This is especially true if the meat was stored improperly. It is important to store cooked meats properly after they are cooked. Raw meat should never be left out at room temperature for longer than two hours. After that, it should be refrigerated.\n\nHow long does it take to get food poisoning from turkey?\n\nYes, you can get turkey poisoning if you eat undercooked meat. It is important to know how to properly cook turkey because it contains a lot of protein and fat. Turkey is very lean and easy to overcook. Undercooked turkey can lead to serious health problems such as kidney failure and liver damage. To avoid getting sick from eating undercooked turkey, always check the temperature of the meat using a meat thermometer. Make sure the turkey reaches 165 degrees Fahrenheit (74 degrees Celsius) when cooked.\n\nHow long does it take to get sick from bad turkey?\n\nYes, if you eat raw meat, poultry, eggs, or seafood that has been contaminated with Salmonella bacteria, you could become ill. It is important to remember that even though the product appears to be \"expired\", it still contains harmful bacteria. This is why it is always recommended to thoroughly wash your hands after handling any type of raw meat, poultry, fish, shellfish, or egg products.\n\nCan you get turkey poisoning?\n\nTurkey is a popular holiday dish but it can be dangerous if not prepared correctly. Turkey contains a protein called \"protease\" which helps break down proteins such as meat, fish, eggs, milk, cheese, and other animal products. Proteases are found naturally in many foods, but they are usually destroyed during cooking. However, if the cooking process is done improperly, proteases can remain active and cause illness. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), people who eat raw or undercooked poultry are at risk of developing campylobacteriosis, salmonellosis, shigellosis, and typhoid fever. These illnesses can lead to diarrhea, abdominal cramps, headache, nausea, vomiting, and fever. Symptoms typically last 4–7 days, although symptoms can persist longer.\n\nCan you get salmonella from expired turkey?\n\nYes, if you eat raw turkey meat, you could get salmonella poisoning. This illness usually happens within three days after eating the contaminated food. Symptoms include diarrhea, fever, stomach cramps, nausea, vomiting, headache, muscle aches, chills, and fatigue. It is important to note that not everyone who eats raw turkey gets ill. However, if you think you got sick from eating raw turkey, tell your doctor right away.\n\nCan you eat turkey after expiration date?\n\nYes, if the meat is still edible. It depends on how long ago the meat was packaged. Turkey meat that is packaged within 3 days of being slaughtered can be eaten safely. However, if the packaging is older than 7 days, it is not safe to consume.\n\nCan you get food poisoning from old turkey?\n\nTurkey contains a toxin called \"botulism\". It is a bacteria that grows in the gut of birds. This bacterium produces a neurotoxin that can cause paralysis if ingested. Symptoms usually occur within 24 hours after ingestion. In severe cases, death occurs within 3 days.\n\nPost navigation\n\nSimilar Posts\n\nDo you ever wonder if drinking expired coffee could hurt you? Coffee has been around since ancient times.

{"text": "Brown Rice Flour (BRF) is just like what it says: A flour (like you make bread with) made out of Brown Rice (preferably organic).\n\nAnyway, I will inject my opinion here: True, the DNA contains the codon for the production N,N-Dimethyltryptamine type compounds, like a great deal of living creatures on this planet (this gene needs mapping!!) all the way from the vegetable kingdom through the reptiles and up to mammals. AFOAF's own personal research into the pharmacodynamics of fungi as chemical synthesis engines has proven the l-tryptophan method to work, but even further down the precursor list of the raw growth factors AFOAF have found that Thiamine HCl (Vitamin B1) when combined with d-Maltose and a source for trace minerals (spring water) not only populates very rapidly but provides comparable synthesis pathways for the production of Indole Alkaloids, and exhibits a superior uptake affinity leaving only trace quantities of un-reacted Thiamine and providing a near complete conversion. When using l-tryptophan significant quantities were found un-reacted although Indole production was higher, leading AFOAF to conclude that environmental situations do affect production factors. AFOAF using lab equipment at a local university and being a chem major did all of the necessary testing to arrive at these conclusions.\n\nActually, it is true. The genetic make-up is stored in the spore. This genetic make-up is commonly known as DNA. The potential of every living creature is decided before birth.\n\nUmmm...yeah. You don't have to lecture me about genetics. I know plenty about genetics.\n\nThe fact is that the substrate -will- have some effect on the mushroom, like I said. That's all I said. I'm not talking about optimal yields, here, (and I'm not quite sure where you got the idea that I was;) I'm talking about real yields, which are always less than optimal.\n\nI mean, I might be the son of two 6'4\" Norwegians, with genes that would put me at that height, but if I don't get adequate nutrition during my growing phases, I could be dwarfed down to 5'5\". Similarly, if your mushrooms are lacking certain nutrients, they certainly could have reduced yields, in terms of mass and/or psilocin/psylocybin content.\n\nAdditionally, it is possible to override genetics -- you put too much stress on a rigidity that isn't there. In the above example, I might be destined to be 6'4\", but if I'm fed HGH, I could be a 7'+ basketball player. Similarly, if you grow your shrooms on a high-tryptamine substrate, you could get psilocin/psilocybin concentrations far in excess of normal amounts -- but these are unusual and extreme conditions.\n\n-------------------- \"Do we want the stars? We can have them. Can we borrow cups of fire from the sun? We can and must and light the world.\" --\"On the Shoulders of Giants\", Ray Bradbury\n\nWe're still agreeing the same thing here. I agree that my statement \"...has nothing to do with potency\" may be misleading and could have been better phrased as \"...little to do...\", but the result is the same.\n\nThe predetermined genetic code is just that. Predetermined. We, as cultivators, can tweak them a bit, but getting the potency of an azurenscens from a cubensis is just not possible because of the limitations of the cubensis.\n\nAgain, I don't think we are disagreeing. We're seeing the same results from different perspectives.\n\nIf the level of staining in fruits as they dry is a guide of potency (not saying it is nor do I want to involve myself in that old debate) well millet grown leaves BRF shrooms for dead. At least twice as much blue discolouration. Then there's the trip and in a test on a friend who has a BIG tolerance (he'll eat 21 grams cracker dry) he said the millet grown was better. Strain, Golden Teacher. The amount of work in PF cakes is actually more IMO than casing grain and the yield is less.\n\nVery true! Manners are not my strength - im too lazy for manners. But you did say: ''The substrate used, for cubensis, has nothing to do with potency. That was decided by genetics' and to say that it has little effect on potency is again incorrect - as Gartz and Bigwood + Beug have demonstrated. I suugest that the cubensis grown on brf have the ability to extract and convert far more precursors than are available, because when the same isolates are grown of millet or manure they are much more potent - significantly = from light blue stains, to dark/ mild to decent potency for cubensis.\n\nMillet will increase the potency of cubensis significantly. If you disagree, grow them on millet and be converted to the truth.\n\nwell I might as well though my 2 cents in ,I do agree that the genetic make-up is stored in the spore how ever there are alot of things to take into account and that can change them for example the PF tek dosn't have alot of nutrients that's why you get smaller shrooms,aborts and less flushes(for the most part) and anything can change the mushrooms out come like temp,humidty,light and nutrients ect.. these not only changes how many mushrooms grow and how strong they will grow but it dose change the level of potency and you can't over tweak the potency of an azurenscens from a cubensis is just not possible because of the limitations of the cubensis the mushroom has guide lines and you can't no go over them how ever if you give them a perect/good invroment they will go to the best of the guide lines.\n\nI'm happy with the potency I get from shrooms grown with brf but to each his own I guess.you may be able to tell the difference in potency but brf is still one of the most common teks out there so it can't be all that bad!!!\n\nCome on Anno - you've got to be saying that to stir me! I could list atleast 20 people who agreed - many of whom suggested that i try millet myself. Bigger yields, chunkier mushrooms and definately better potency than brf. When i started out i grew the same isolate of tasmanians on brf, manure bulk, millet, and rye grain and the millet babies dried blew all our heads off at half the dose of BRF tassies.\n\nTake two dry grams of cubensis grown with BRF and two grams of dry cubensis grown on millet and it is doubtful one would notice a difference in potency. The difference noted would, likely, be in yield, but let's not argue again.\n\nIt's obvious, millet grown stains/darkens more and they only darken further as they dry. Millet also grows them bigger and more meaty than BRF. Like mull, I like booty. Millet gives more food to the unit input. Millet costs less to do. Millet make less mess in the procedure. Millet has less work involved period. What more could you want?\n\nQuality of produce in Oz is excellent. That's a fact.\n\nI use BRF in asian style cooking. Human food grade but it's not as good as millet in my observations. Millet is better and that's the feed back from friends (it's not my imagination) one of which has a BIG tolerance. He chews down 21 grams of millet grown GT in a hit. He smokes only filth and lots of it. Wants the best. No candy tales.\n\nMillet in comparison is HID. I'll try manure when the warm weather comes. But I know BRF is obsolete for mushrooms.\n\nAnd, I hope that you are aware that bluing alone doesn?t give a measure about the potency of a mushroom. If you would go by bluing, then P. semilanceata would be an inactive mushroom, which couldn?t be farther from the truth.\n\nI agree on the other points you listed that speak in favor of millet, I use it myself.", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "3592c38b-be8b-4e0f-a9c9-7cc0fb18e645", "url": "https://www.shroomery.org/forums/showflat.php/Number/1694393/fpart/2"}

{"text": "The Adventure and Crisis of Marriage\n\nAugust 11, 2015\n\nGilbert Keith Chesterton wrote, \"The whole pleasure of marriage is that it is a perpetual crisis.\" Nowadays, there is a new crisis in the crisis of marriage that is hardly a source of pleasure because it is an identity crisis. The challenge is to refrain from despairing over the institution of marriage by remembering, with Chestertonian optimism, that marriage cannot be destroyed. Though marriage can be called gay, it cannot make marriage any less gay (in the true sense of the word). Marriage is perpetual, even if it is a perpetual crisis, and that is something to take pleasure in. What God has enjoined, no man can put asunder. And though days are dark, Catholics must arm themselves with that joy Chesterton called, \"the joy of giants, the joy without a cause.\"\n\n\"Marriage is a fact,\" writes G. K. Chesterton, \"an actual human relation like that of motherhood, which has certain habits and loyalties, except for a few monstrous cases where it is turned to torture by insanity or sin.\" The monstrous cases of marriage that Chesterton mentions have, unfortunately, become the modern cases of marriage. On June 26, 2013, the United States Supreme Court struck down the Defense of Marriage Act, legally allowing homosexual couples to receive the same benefits of married heterosexual couples. On June 26, 2015, two years later to the day, the Supreme Court ruled that it is unconstitutional for states to ban same-sex \"marriage,\" making the USA the 21st of the 21st century countries to legalize same-sex unions. Though acclaimed as a victory for love, the embrace of impotence in love will only render love impotent. This is one of the dangerous illusions of our time, \"the illusion of familiarity\" as Chesterton put it in The Everlasting Man, when perversion becomes convention. Making homosexual \"marriage\" legal does not make it natural, even if it is to become normal.\n\nIn a statement after the SCOTUS ruling, President Obama said, \"Our nation was founded on a bedrock principle that we all are created equal.\" Mr. Chesterton would probably find it amusing to hear the President speak of bedrock when all is a landslide of change (as he promised). If Mr. Chesterton could debate Mr. Obama over mugs of ale, it is possible that the former would mention the irony of the latter mentioning the immutability of God's creating human beings and not the immutability of God's creating human institutions. Mr. Chesterton might then find Mr. Obama's intertwining the ideas of equality and equivalency alarming, while certainly agreeing that all are created equal but certainly not the same. Equality does not mean equivalence. Distinction is important in order to retain importance. Finally, GKC might declare that, as human beings, all should love each other equally while following the natural law of our Creator who created us man and woman to be fruitful and multiply. In this are truth and happiness and freedom.\n\n\"This ruling is a victory for America,\" says Mr. Obama. \"This decision affirms what millions of Americans already believe in their hearts. When all Americans are treated as equal, we are all more free.\" To rule against truth is not a victory, Mr. Chesterton interjects. It is a failure. If truth is disposable, then what worth is there in the world? Only truth will make Americans more free—not nihilism. The President smiles politely and resumes. \"We are people who believe every child is entitled to life and liberty and the pursuit of happiness. There is so much more work to be done to extend the full promise of America to every American. But today, we can say in no uncertain terms that we've made our union a little more perfect. That's the consequence of a decision from the Supreme Court, but more importantly, it is a consequence of the countless small acts of courage of millions of people across decades who stood up… and came to believe in themselves and who they were. And slowly made an entire country realize that love is love.\"\n\nLove is love. Mr. Chesterton thumps his mug and wipes his whiskers emphatically. That much is absolute. But, to be clear, a man is not necessarily a man or a woman necessarily a woman, nor an unborn baby necessarily a child entitled to life and liberty and the pursuit of happiness. It all depends on how people feel, and how \"courageous\" they are willing to be in denying the truth. President Obama is wrong, Mr. Chesterton declares. The relativism at the helm of America is not a herald of perfection. It is jazz. It is Jezebel. It is a harbinger of disintegration. Love is love, however, and love leads to newness of life. Love advances life. Sterility, death, and court rulings over divine decrees do not. Love is love, and it is unchanging because it is a reflection of God Himself. Love has established His order. Let no man put it asunder.\n\nMr. Chesterton lights a cigar.\n\nMarriage is the sacramental union between a man and a woman that allows for procreation. With the SCOTUS ruling, this foundation of civilization has taken a further tumble, but it will never crumble. As Chesterton put it, \"This triangle of truisms, of father, mother and child, cannot be destroyed; it can only destroy those civilizations which disregard it.\" The United States Supreme Court has made a mockery of marriage and of family by paving the way for homosexual unions. But it was a general and gradual capitulation to darkness, and even death, that first paved the way to this insanity. Fornication. Divorce. Contraception. Abortion. Pornography. Homosexuality. \"The next great heresy,\" Chesterton prophesied, \"will be an attack on morality, especially sexual morality.\" That great heresy hangs over us like the sky. But marriage cannot die. Marital love is a force for fertility, one that seeks to give and grow continually, and will continue.\n\nThe crisis of marriage goes on, and Catholics must bear the truth on high as a banner, undaunted and with joy. A work that colors the collapse and call-to-arms of our times is Mr. Chesterton's \"The Ballad of the White Horse,\" in which a conquered king fearlessly wages war again against his conquers. So long as he fights for the right reason, he will fight. The words from his vision of the Mother of God should serve as the marching refrain for Catholic America as it is hurled somewhere over the rainbow:\n\nThe men of the East may spell the stars, And times and triumphs mark, But the men signed of the cross of Christ Go gaily in the dark.\n\nThough \"the sky grows darker yet and the sea rises higher,\" go gaily in the dark. Take heart. They are more tired of what Mr. Obama calls \"victory,\" than we are tired of shame, to paraphrase the Ballad. Marriage will not lose its meaning nor its fruitfulness so long as some are willing to hold true to the course. \"Marriage is a duel to the death which no man of honor should decline,\" wrote Gilbert Keith Chesterton, and the same can be said for the duel for marriage.\n\n—\n\nSean Fitzpatrick is a graduate of Thomas Aquinas College and the Headmaster of Gregory the Great Academy.

{"text": "Financial Help & Budgeting Tips for Single Parents\n\nBeing a single parent is financially challenging. If you've relied on your credit cards to make it, you may be be paying a hefty price in monthly interest. Find out how to pay off your credit cards with a non-profit debt consolidation program. You may qualify for lower rates and lower payments.[\n\nChoose Your Debt Amount\n\nDebt Help for Single Parents\n\n\"Being a single parent,\" Meg Lowrey writes, \"is not a life full of struggles, but a journey for the strong.\"\n\nLowrey's statement, which has been used by other single moms as a source of inspiration, captures the life of a single parent perfectly: He/she lives with great rewards, but faces significant challenges — emotionally, socially and especially financially.\n\nA study by the U.S. Census Bureau showed that of the 195 countries and territories in the world, the U.S. has the highest rate of children living in single-parent households. Over 25% of U.S. children live with one parent and no other adult. That number is more than three times of rate of children around the world living with one parent (6.8%).\n\nThe most recent government census statistics from 2020 put the total of children living in single-parent households at 21.6 million. Of that, 80% of the households are headed by single mothers. There are 3.3 million households guided by a single father. There are several charities and foundations geared to helping single moms. Help for single parents via government and charitable programs is not defined by gender.\n\nOf course, the COVID-19 pandemic that dominated much of 2020-2021 caused even more problems for single-parent households. In a survey of 7,400 caregivers with children younger than five, researchers from the University of Oregon found that single parents struggled greatly to manage their health and the health of their children.\n\nThose increased stress levels in single parents also had adverse effects on the health of their children. Of those surveyed in the University of Oregon study, some 30% of single parents missed well-baby and/or well-child doctor visits. Also, there was a 40% drop off from 2019 levels in vaccine shots for children being raised in single-parent households.\n\nSupport for single parents struggling to keep it all together is there to be found. Programs are available through the government, private organizations and some self-help websites. Some of it is easy to find; some takes work.\n\nBut it's there.\n\nFederal Programs and Benefits for Single Parents\n\nNothing is more concerning to a single parent – to any parent, really — than ensuring his or her child has enough food to eat, and that it's the proper food. Doing that on a single income can be extremely challenging.\n\nThe government has several programs that provide single mother help and single father help. Funding of these programs can be political footballs, but Congress generally retains its commitment to them.\n\nSome programs are based on income, while others come via the school system.\n\nOutright grants are also available based on need. The website singlemothersgrants.org provides a comprehensive list of grants available nationwide. Applications are required, but could be well worth an hour's time it takes to fill out. The Single Parents Alliance of America includes a link to check eligibility for programs that may be of help.\n\nFinancial Aid Benefits\n\nSome aid programs, which provide real buying benefits, are based on income. AFDC (Aid to Families With Dependent Children) provides cash payments for families that lack the support of a parent. Need is defined by each state. TANF (Temporary Assistance for Needy Families) assistance lasts five years, and may have work requirements, depending on the state.\n\nFood Programs\n\nTwo key food programs are among the more important benefits single parents can rely on. SNAP (Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program) helps low-income families through direct monthly benefits. Formerly known as Food Stamps, eligibility for SNAP depends on income.\n\nWIC (the supplemental program for Women, Infants and Children) helps low-income applicants who are pregnant, breastfeeding or who have children younger than five. The WIC website provides information on applying and benefits.\n\nSNAP helps those who qualify buy necessities at places like grocery stores or farmers' markets. WIC is about providing supplemental food to under-nourished women and children during their developmental years.\n\nThe Department of Agriculture (USDA) offers several nutritional programs through school lunch and breakfast programs. The USDA also has a Summer Food Service Program and TEFAP (The Emergency Food Assistance Program), which provides free-food help to low-income single parents, as well as families and individuals.\n\nHousing Assistance\n\nThe Housing Choice Vouchers Program – formerly called the Section 8 program – helps provide low-income families that can't afford rent the chance to live in a home that is clean and safe. Vouchers are issued at the local level and can be applied to homes that meet the standards of the Public Housing Authority.\n\nThe home is rented by the single parent, and the PHA pays the \"voucher\" subsidy to the owner. The single parent is only responsible for the difference between rent and voucher. The PHA determines eligibility by family size and income.\n\nLow-income single parents also can apply for low-cost rental units from the Public Housing Assistance Program. More than 3,300 local public housing agencies take part in the program, in all 50 states.\n\nLIHEAP (Low Income Home Energy Assistance Programs) provides low-income single parents help with their electric bills. Applications are accepted on a local basis.\n\nHealth Care Support for Single Parents and Children\n\nEmployed single parents who have access to health insurance through their employer will usually find that is their best option for health care. However, not everyone has that benefit. The government provides health care plans through the Affordable Care Act, but those have seen rising costs.\n\nMedicaid helps low-income families for those who lack or are without health insurance. Eligibility is determined by state, but the ACA allowed states to expand their Medicaid programs, and 24 of the states have found it beneficial to do so in recent years. Maine, Virginia, Utah, Idaho and Nebraska have expanded their Medicaid benefits in recent years.\n\nCHIP (Children's Health Insurance Program) provides low-cost health care to families who make too much to qualify for Medicaid but not enough to buy private insurance. Those in need can apply at any time. Congress has funded the program through 2023.\n\nMedicare, a health insurance, government run program for the elderly, is for those 65 and older, and there could be single parents in that group who could benefit from the low-cost program. But in certain rare circumstances, those under 65 can qualify. The Medicare site has an eligibility tool to determine what individuals meet the requirements.\n\nTitle X is administered by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, providing low-income single parents and families with comprehensive and confidential family planning services and preventive health services.\n\nLegal Assistance for Single Parents\n\nThe Legal Aid Society offers help to individuals and families who otherwise can't afford a lawyer. Legal aid is available for help with domestic abuse problems, family law problems, rental assistance, consumer and personal injury cases. The Federal Government Pro Bono Program also offers assistance from attorneys in more than 50 federal agencies.\n\nHowever, both groups have limitations on what type of cases they can be involved with based on conflict-of-interest. Be aware that lawyers volunteering with these organizations often need advance approval before they can assist with cases.\n\nNonprofit and Local Help for Single Parents\n\nEmma Johnson of Wealthy Single Mommy recently decided to give a $500 grant to one single mother each month. Qualifications are basic: You're a single mom and you need the money. Once Johnson made the program public, three donors who follow her web site (wealthysinglemommy.com) added $5,500 in matching funds. Applications are on her site.\n\nThat's a unique way to help that shows the help is available.\n\nAvailable Programs and Help\n\nSingle Mother Grants lists dozens of potential aid programs and grants via charities or churches for needs as specific as electric bills and medications. The site also has a state-by-state list of grants available to single parents.\n\nThe Single Parents Alliance of America has a list of government assistance available, with a link that checks eligibility. The website also lists (among other things) seven places to get free assistance, places to feed children on Sundays and the best careers for single parents.\n\nHelp with Budgets\n\nWith the help of the internet, more single parents are sharing their stories. Some are relating how they plowed their way to financial viability.\n\nKumiko Love, founder of The Budget Mom, paid off $77,821 in credit card debt and student loan debt in eight months. Chonce' Rhea paid off almost $50,000 in debt in 2015, two years after she was living in low-income housing and making $35,000 per year. She now tells her story on mydebtephinay.com. Yvonne Kaloki writes a blog Hudduma from London to help single mothers.\n\nAll talk of the importance of chipping away at debt so that single parents can keep the money they earn and start to build some savings. All stressed budgeting, determining where money is spent and how to keep track.\n\nThere's probably not a lot more aggravating than being preached to about budgets when you need help with the electric bill. But getting to a more secure point has to start somewhere, and often the work put into budgeting and realizing where money goes makes a difference.\n\nThough budgets are individual to each person and circumstance, a few general principles apply. Ideally, rent or housing should not cost more than 30% of monthly income. On average, though, single parents spend slightly more (35.8%).\n\nSome basic steps can make a difference. Turning the thermostat down a couple degrees in the winter and putting on a sweater or sweatshirt can help with utility bills. Being aware and frugal with other necessary expenses — water, cell phone, internet, etc. – also can help. Listing annual subscriptions in one place can be eye-opening. The web site TrueBill can help sort through these expenses.\n\nAfter figuring her necessary expenses, Love uses envelopes with remaining cash to keep track of variable spending — the item bought at the store on a whim, the rare night out for a glass of wine and dinner, a movie with the kids. By keeping what she has in cash, she knows what she has to spend.\n\nSavings also is vital. Even setting aside $20 a week over a year adds up to $1,040. The more that can be saved, the better.\n\nThe key to a budget: Being honest about where the money is going; being willing to change to make ends meet; and being disciplined enough to stick to the goals.\n\nIt takes work, willpower and a plan – and not being afraid to seek help when it's needed.\n\nChild Care Help and Deductions for Single Parents\n\nFinding affordable childcare can be a tremendous challenge, and burden, for single working parents with pre-school children. One important government program is the Child Care Assistance Program, which provides funds to states to help pay for childcare costs for low-income families. Each state runs its own program. ChildCare.gov has a link to information for each state.\n\nHead Start provides learning opportunities for children up to age 5 from low-income families. Eligibility is generally based on family income at or below the poverty level. Some states fund pre-K for children aged 3 to 5, and some churches operate a daycare center or can connect you with another religious group that might.\n\nTax Breaks for Single Parents\n\nThe main tax break for a single Mom or Dad comes in the ability to file as head of household, which lowers the tax burden and increases the standard deduction. Those who work and use childcare for children under the age of 13 can claim the Child Care Credit. Single parents with children under 17 can also claim the Child Tax Credit. Credits are of great benefit because they reduce the amount of taxes due, and in some cases could lead to a tax refund if the credits exceed what was paid.\n\nFor 2020, the IRS allowed parents to claim up to $2,000 per child under the age of 17. That credit lowered the amount owed in taxes. For 2021, the Child Tax Credit increased to $3,600 for children younger than 6 and $3,000 for children ages 6-17. Also, the credit is now fully refundable. You will qualify for the Child Tax Credit of your modified adjusted gross income is $75,000 or less for single filers.\n\nSupplementing Income\n\nIt's easy to say re-budget or re-focus to make ends meet, just like it's easy to say get a second job to add to your income. For a single parent, working one job while raising a happy, healthy child is difficult enough. In the age of COVID, it's also wise to limit your out-of-the-house exposure to minimize risk to your health and your child's. One advantage of today's economy is that online opportunities can help, and every little bit helps.\n\nProofreading or transcription sites will pay, and the work can be done on your timetable. Dog lovers could make a few extra dollars by starting a dog-walking business through Rover – and the more adventurous could also dog-sit and make more money. Several sites – Opinion Outpost, Toluna and LifePoints are three – will pay those who take online surveys. If you have the free time, restaurant and grocery store apps will pay for delivery. Selling old household items (especially toys that your child has grown out of) on eBay or Amazon Marketplace – remember: one person's junk is another's treasure – also can provide some extra cash, and give the extra benefit of reducing clutter.\n\nFinancial Aid to Help Single Parents Pay for Their Education\n\nSingle parents who decide to go to college should be able to qualify for a Pell Grant, which goes to low income applicants. A new focus for the Grants is to help low-income single moms, and the amount will increase from $5,350 to $6,900 over the next 10 years. The best part about a grant is it is not a loan; it does not need to be re-paid. The first step in applying for a Pell Grant is to fill out the FAFSA – the Free Application for Federal Student Aid. Single parents can quickly learn how much he or she qualifies for by submitting income and the number of children. The FSEOG (Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant) program is administered by colleges; not all take part, but those who do can grant up to $4,000 to those in need.\n\nSeveral other programs offer grants to single parents. The Women's Independence Scholarship Program helps victims of domestic abuse. The Raise the Nation Foundation offers assistance to single parent women to help with education costs or to repay student loans. The Capture the Dream Fund is a San Francisco Bay Area group that offers $1,000 scholarships to single parents (yes, a student can accept more than one scholarship or grant). Soroptomist is about empowering women through education; every year it distributes more than $2.5 million in education grants to approximately 1,700 women around the world.\n\nTwo other groups that could offer help for single mothers are the American Association of University Women, and the Adults Belong in College scholarship (ABC) program.\n\nFor Domestic Violence Survivors\n\nIf you have been the victim of domestic violence, as well as financial abuse, there are numerous resources that can help you transition to a new, independent life with your children.

The first and most important step is to confront the problem and create a plan.\n\nThe easiest step might be to contact a nonprofit credit counseling agency and get FREE advice on how to manage your money. The certified counselors go through your income and expenses to help you create an affordable budget.\n\nAdjust the thermostat in your home to save on heating and air-conditioning\n\nDrive a cheaper car that gets better gas mileage.\n\nEventually, you should arrive at a point where you can open a separate savings account and start building an emergency fund. Having a separate account will reduce the temptation to spend the money and you'll be surprised how quickly it grows.\n\nEmergencies are a special worry for single parents. If you child breaks an arm and you have a big insurance deductible, you'll need reserve funds. There are little expenses, too, like field trips, athletic equipment and music lessons. Not all are emergencies, but if they're unexpected, the money must come from somewhere.\n\nThe best tip is to only use credit cards for emergency situations. The interest rate on credit cards averages 16.7% in 2022 and if you have a bad credit score, it is going to be closer to 25%-29%. The interest rate on payday loans is frightening, averaging just under 400% APR.\n\nGet on a budget … and stay with it! Don't waste money paying high-interest debts that you don't have to pay. Becoming a single parent requires many adjustments and learning to live with less is a big one.\n\nThe Census Bureau reports that custodial parents receiving the full amount of child support due was just 43.5% in 2015. Another 30% received no payments at all. The average custodial parent received only $3,950 for the year.\n\nSaving for your children's college education and for your own retirement can be difficult when you're on your own. But try to make contributions to your employer-sponsored 401(k) retirement plan, especially if the employer matches your contributions. If you can put money in a college fund, consider using a state-sponsored plan with tax advantages.\n\nFinally, plan for the unexpected. Make sure you carry necessary insurance policies. Life and disability insurance are vital if you don't have a large nest egg and die or become disabled. Also, draft an estate plan that includes a will and names a guardian for your minor children. If you have savings, be clear about how you want they divided if you die", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "bd255dc5-dd6c-4ad5-b86a-9d83233e4972", "url": "https://www.incharge.org/debt-relief/financial-help-single-moms-and-dads/"}
{"text": "The Devil Has You\n\nMost people are average and they hate themselves. Even if they don't admit it and curse their lot putting blame left and right, like Job, when shit hits the fan, they secretly wish they were not born. After all, even all those religions and philosophies, the ones that should supposedly save, support that view. Even the most uplifting ones agree that it's best not to be born, but if one already happens to be here, one should go the distance. Either just because, or to eventually not be born again, or to rise and be reborn into another better world (which amounts to the same).\n\nTalk about mediocre worldviews of an average man.\n\nBut it's hardly surprising, because average people are weak. No matter if they can punch through a wall or outsmart everyone else. They get easily swayed like reed in the wind by any allure that licks their perceived insecurities which they hate so much. It does not matter if they cling to the carrot like a tick and call it principled and steadfast. They will bend over backwards to keep sucking up to the pacifier of their choice.\n\nLeft or right leaning, on top or on bottom, forward or backward looking. Atheist, theist, religious, or spiritual. Makes no difference. Average man just plods and is offended. Whether wide awake or sleeping. All. The. Time.\n\nGod benignantly smirks at the amount of might with which average men might offer their love, and I certainly don't want to be loved the way average men love themselves. So yeah JC, you got this one quite wrong. Or was it just Bible?\n\nIn any case —\n\nDear average people, fuck your philosophies, religions, spiritual and other inclinations. Fuck your vices masked as feel-good virtues. Fuck your lukewarm mediocrity that oozes out of you with idiotic zeal or goody two-shoes hypocrisy.

{"text": "Snapstreak has to be the one Snapchat feature that helps with user retention. Maintaining Snapstreaks is a significant thing for most Snapchat users. It was created as a strategic incentive for users to keep returning and utilizing the site. As a result, losing a Snapstreak due to things like server outages or software difficulties is a genuinely awful experience. If you've just lost your Snapstreak with a close friend or significant other, here's how to get it back on Snapchat.\n\nGet Your Snapstrek Back (2022)\n\nWhat is Snapstreak?\n\nSnapstreaks, or Snapchat Streaks, are a visual representation of regular interactions with a Snapchat user. When you and a friend start sending snaps to each other at least once per 24 hours for three days in a row, you've started a Snapstreak. To be clear, your Snapstreaks will not be affected by text conversations within the Snapchat app. If you don't share a photo or video with Snapchat friends or loved ones within a 24-hour window, you'll lose your Snapstreak.\n\nWhen the streak starts, you'll notice a fire emoji (🔥) next to their name in the chat list. When you start sending each other Snaps on a regular basis, a number shows next to the fire emoji. It represents your Snapstreak, or how many days you've been trading Snaps with each other. The number 58 in the graphic above, for example, indicates that the sender has been delivering Snaps to the recipient for approximately two months.\n\nIf you don't send the other person a snap within 24 hours, your Snapstreak will expire. A warning appears in the form of an hourglass emoji, reminding you to snap the other person. However, technical faults or network issues may cause you to lose your Snapchat streak. If you believe you have lost your Snapstreak by accident, Snapchat allows you to file an appeal. Learn how to request that your Snapchat streak be restored in the next section.\n\nRestore Streak in 4 Easy Steps\n\n1. Open Snapchat and tap on your Bitmoji (or profile icon) at the top-left corner. When your profile opens, press the Settings icon from the top-right corner of the screen.\n\n2. Scroll down until you find the \"Support\" section and select \"I Need Help\". You will now be taken to Snapchat's support page. Tap \"Snapstreaks\" to view Snapstreaks-related support topics.\n\n3. Look4. A form will appear, prompting you to enter information such as your login, email, phone number, device, friend's username, and more. To submit the request, fill in the required information and hit \"Send.\" It's worth noting that when making the request, you can only use the username of one friend. If you've lost numerous Snapstreaks, you'll need to make separate requests to Snapchat.\n\nSo there you have it, our approach to getting Snapstreak back in Snapchat. Even if you failed to send Snaps to keep the Snapstreak alive, you can include that information in the support ticket's \"What information should we know?\" textbox. Then you can cross your fingers and hope that your Snapstreak is restored by the company. Even in such forgetful situations, Snapstreaks have been reported to be easily regained. However, if you make this a habit, you are unlikely to regain your streak. Good luck, and do let us know whether you were able to retrieve your Snapstreak in the comments section below.", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "9bc79d89-c2a4-4662-9729-bcca65f33621", "url": "https://techtwist.tech/heres-how-to-get-snapstreak-back-in-4-easy-steps/"}

{"text": "Sunday, March 26, 2017\n\nRepeal? Replace? Re-whatever!\n\nSo they kept us on the edge of our seats for weeks. Yes, the replacement for the ACA would happen\nbefore Congress adjourned for April recess.\nAnd yes, everyone would forever after have access to health care…only\nthey wouldn't.\n\nThen the lobbying and jockeying for votes happened. One side wanted amendments to the\nreplacement which would be more beneficial to senior citizens and those with\nchronic conditions. The other side\nwanted to go even further away from any government involvement with people's\nhealth insurance and healthcare.\n\nAnd this conflict was just between Republicans and…wait for\nit…Republicans!\n\nThe Democrats in Congress were not even consulted about the\nnow defunct American Health Care Act. No\none in the ruling party even attempted to reach out to the Democrats for their\ninput. Granted, Democrats put up a\nunited front against the replacement of the ACA, but still a phone call would\nhave been nice. Or even a tweet…\n\nAnd in the end, the final vote was delayed for a day to give\nthe recalcitrant members of the Republican Party more time to negotiate the\nchanges to Ryancare or Trumpcare or Whatever-you-care-to-call-it Care. And it came to pass that the vote was\nrescheduled to the next day, a Friday of all days. By afternoon Republican leaders in the House\nrealized that they still did not have the votes to pass their precious healthcare\nlaw. And lo, they shrugged and pulled\nthe plug on the vote.\n\nFor those who have found the ACA to be a god send this was a\ngood Friday. For others who rue the day\nthe ACA passed it was, \"Good grief!\"\n\nThe President, who has vowed for years in his writings and\nhis insufferable campaign rallies, that\nevery American will have health insurance, no one will get left behind and die on\nthe streets ill and/or bankrupt. It\nappears that all this time the President has been wanting America to have a…wait\nfor it….single payer system! Too bad he hitched his political fortunes to the\nGOP elephant who shrieks and bellows it's mighty trunk at the thought of\nAmericans being entitled (oh, there's that \"E\" word again) to affordable\nhealthcare.\n\nIn the end the President must have concluded that even HE\ndid not like the plan Paul Ryan and his colleagues offered as a replacement for\nthe ACA. So what the hell! Pull the vote, tell everyone they tried\ntheir best, but in the end they could not do it. Then announce we won't even try to replace\nthe law we hated for seven years. We\nwill just move on to something else.\n\nOnly everyone did not try their best. Again, a reach across the aisle might have\nhelped, but…oh, right we already went through that.\n\nGee it seemed so easy to repeal the ACA when Obama was\nPresident. They did it sixty plus times,\nbut could never get the President to sign off on it. It's that damn replacement part that got\nthem in trouble. It's not like they\ndidn't offer half-hearted proposals over the years and it's not like they had\nany time to formulate a workable replacement to the ACA.\n\nOh wait; they had SEVEN YEARS to formulate a workable\nreplacement! So now they are surprised\nthat they built a replacement over the span of mere weeks and not enough people\ncan agree to pass it?\n\nThe last minute abandoning of the AHCA was\ndisappointing. The Republicans cheated\nthe American people out of their long-promised climax to their efforts to give\nthe country their version of affordable healthcare.\n\nNow, now fellow liberals,\nhear me out!\n\nIt was disappointing because if the vote had happened then\nwe would know who our adversaries and who are friends are in this fight. Yes, we've got statements from many\nprominent Republicans saying how they WOULD have voted, but since they never\ngot a chance to vote, we will never know for sure who to trust and who to\ndismiss. It ain't official until it's in\nthe Congressional Record.\n\nNow those legislators can honestly go back to the people in\ntheir districts and say, \"See I didn't take your healthcare away from you,\" or \"See,\nI never got a chance to replace your healthcare with something better.\" It's a win-win for everyone except the\nAmerican voter.\n\nAnd since the Republican emphasis has always been on total\ndestruction of affordable healthcare and who cares if we have anything to\nreplace it, the real conversation about improving the law has never taken\nplace. No one ever said the ACA was\nperfect. It does have flaws which need\nto be discussed, debated and then negotiated for the common good.\n\nUnfortunately that is not bound to happen in the\nhyper-partisan, toxic environment inside the Beltway for some time to\ncome. What could happen through all this\nis perhaps a wakening among the people (Congress, you do remember the people,\nright?) that the ACA is not\nperfect, the AHCA is certainly far from\nperfect, and that America should adopt a…wait for it…single payer system!\n\nI, too, am amazed that they had SEVEN YEARS to come up with something and didn't. I am NOT amazed that _____ is blaming everyone and saying he never vowed to repeal-replace ACA ever .... except for every time his lips flapped.", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "41f5c8d9-e482-476b-9278-6ff7fdeb5c90", "url": "https://arteejee.blogspot.com/2017/03/repeal-replace-re-whatever.html"}

{"text": "When it comes down to it, life is a cycle. It may sound cliche, but it is as simple as that. A child is born, helpless, without the ability to communicate or understand most of what is going on around him or her. Slowly, the world comes into focus, things start to make sense. The little girl or boy becomes a young woman or man. She or he follows the path that society has set forth, or follows his or her heart instead.\n\nLife happens, beautiful things and tragic things happen and every kind of thing in between. And then, eventually, that adult might begin to notice that things start to lose focus. Or perhaps it is loved ones around him or her that notice. Sometimes the ability to communicate and understand his or her surroundings starts to fade. And in the twilight of the cycle, there is a helplessness, much like the one that occurred at the dawn of it.\n\nTaking time to understand difficulties later on As we age, we begin to lose some of the strengths we had when we were young. Sometimes this is physical, sometimes it is mental, and sometimes it is a bit of both. There are many elderly care centers solely dedicated to helping older people navigate this time of life that could be difficult, scary, and confusing.\n\nAnd while it is important to have staff and family members who can help with the physical issues, some of the most meaningful moments you can have with someone is feeling those trying emotions of uncertainty is to simply let them know you are there. Listen, comfort, show up, and keep in mind that someday you might follow their path and will need a kind soul to look after you as well.\n\nThe logistics of caring for the elderly\nIf you are caring for an older family member or if you work in a nursing home or similar facility, you will likely need to stock up on items that you would probably not have around otherwise. This could include walking support devices, syringes for diabetes, disposable bed pads or washable bed pads for incontinence, diapers for adults, and more.\n\nAs our bodies get older, they begin to deteriorate a bit and do not always function the way that we want them to. Different types of walkers are necessary for different people, diapers for adults can become a new part of the daily routine, and there will probably be medication involved. Keeping a close eye on each of these things is important for the health and wellbeing of the elderly individual.\n\nCaring for the elderly will give you a new perspective on life. Not only will they have stories to share of lives well lived, but you will also see all that there is to be grateful for. All that you have that they have lost, or all that they have they you may not have even realized you possess yet. And you never know, some of these realizations could sneak up on you while you are stocking up on diapers for adults or medication dispensers.", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "20446c2c-c0c4-4ae4-b627-826148d58142", "url": "https://healthandfitnesstips.us/diapers-for-adults-and-other-important-aspects-of-elderly-care/"}

{"text": "SPORT BENEFITS\n\nCOLLAMIN® FOR YOU TO:\n\nCollagen peptides can increase the protein content in the body, which can build muscle and has a regenerating effect on the articular cartilage. Collagen, used as a post-exercise shake absorbs rapidly in the body and can quickly work to help repair and replenish proteins broken down during exercise\n\nMUSCLE RECOVERY AND REGENERATION\n\nDuring long periods of exercise, oxidation causes protein loss in the muscle. Providing your body with sufficient collagen can ensure optimum muscle regeneration and a faster recovery process. You won't feel quite as sore.\n\nAdditionally, Collagen can also show some benefits on sleeping patterns. According to some research, people who took collagen described better quality sleep and as you probably know, it will keep you well rested and your muscles will get the recovery they need.\n\nJOINT INJURIES IN ATHLETES\n\nStudies have shown that athletes who suffered from joint pain because of their intense physical activity reported an improvement in their pain, after taking collagen per day. Stiffness and swelling in joints also reduce, which in turn means less discomfort and more mobility to continue practicing sports.\n\nBETTER INJURY RECOVERY\n\nCollagen peptides make a big difference in athletes. Some studies have shown that athletes who suffered from joint pain because of their intense physical activity reported an improvement in their pain, after taking 10g of collagen per day for 24 weeks.\n\nMany popular sports, such as running and cycling involve repetitive, high impact movements. These can result in excessive stress on joints and even damage the cartilage, tendons and ligaments. Studies back the multiple benefits of collagen peptides in supporting connective tissues such as: • Regeneration of cartilage and reducing joint inflammation • Reducing joint discomfort • Supporting connective tissues\n\nSince athletes are more likely to suffer from joints injuries, they can take early measures to prevent any future damage by taking a collagen protein supplement. That means that collagen is not only a great supplement for people who suffer some medical conditions, but also for men and women who exercise daily and stress their joints to their limit. They will experience less pain and therefore can exercise more frequently.\n\nMUSCLE STRENGTH\n\nAccording to a scientific study collagen peptide supplementation in combination with resistance training improves body composition and increases muscle strength.\n\nMAINTAIN NITROGEN BALANCE\n\nHigh nitrogen content compared with whey (on a per g basis) because of high proportion of amino acids that have a low molecular weight or contain more than one nitrogen atom.\n\nClinical studies have demonstrated Collagen Peptide is efficient in maintaining the user's nitrogen balance and in promoting muscle mass and strength.\n\nSUPPORT ENERGY FOR MUSCLE\n\nSource of energy that is used to power the movement of contraction in working muscles is adenosine triphosphate (ATP) found in your cells.\n\nCreatine is a molecule consisting of three amino acids – Glycine, Arginine and methionine – which supports the replacement of depleted ATP levels.\n\nCOLLAMIN Collagen Peptides consist of 20 % Glycine and 8 % Arginine unique amino acid combination may support the synthesis of creatine in the body to improve physical performance during high intensity repeated bouts of exercise.\n\nCONNECTIVE TISSUES\n\nWhen you add more weight to your exercise routine, your muscles can start to grow faster than your connective tissues, potentially leading to injuries. Your connective tissues are made almost entirely out of collagen. Adding collagen to your diet can help grow your ligaments according to your muscle's development.\n\nTIPS: BEST RESULTS BY CONTINUOUS CONSUMPTION\n\nNewsletter\n\nSubscribe to get special offers, free giveaways, and once-in-a-lifetime deals.", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "926e82b3-f041-4a72-a497-8faec7418749", "url": "https://www.collamin.be/pages/sport-benefits"}

{"text": "Let's add this to the list of games that I didn't expect to have me so hooked. Over the past week, I have been playing Eiyuden Chronicle Rising, and boy, it's an absolute gem of a title. Eiyuden Chronicle: Rising is an action role-playing game made by developer Natsume Atari and published by 505 Games based in the same universe as Eiyuden Chronicle: Hundred Heroes that has fast-paced fighting and town-upgrading mechanics. This title is also the spiritual successor to Suikoden. This alone will have fans extremely excited to play. Additionally, Rising was the final and stretch goal for the Eiyuden Chronicle: Hundred Heroes Kickstarter. Needless to say, thank you to everyone who pushed the title on the platform as we are able to play the prologue to the Eiyuden Chronicle: Hundred Heroes universe which is set to release in 2023.\n\nThe pre-war stories of many characters who would eventually become your companions in Eiyuden Chronicle are woven together in this game. This title presents a portion of the Eiyuden Chronicle cast of characters. Players that link the game to the Eiyuden Chronicle will receive certain benefits in The Heroes of the Hundred.\n\nPersonally, Eiyuden Chronicle Rising had not originally piqued my interest. It seemed like a much watered-down version of the upcoming Hundred Heroes. Safe to say, I was wrong. This game quickly became something of its own to appreciate. Even if the town building is not your cup of tea, the atmosphere and character-building cause you to care about what is happening with the people of New Nevaeh. Mix in some great action and fantastic artwork Eiyuden Chronicle Rising holds its own as a viable title, not just a game to kill time until Hundred Heroes.\n\nEiyuden Chronicle: Rising is out now on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Nintendo Switch, and PC.

{"text": "Daylight Harvesting & A Carbon-Free Boston\n\nIn our previous blog posts, we explored several daylighting systems and window treatment options that can help the City of Boston in its goal of becoming 100 percent carbon-free by the year 2050. These daylighting (or daylight harvesting) systems work by using daylight to offset the amount of electric lighting needed to light a space, reducing energy consumption through lighting control systems that adjust electric lighting in response to daylight levels.\n\nActive daylighting systems track sunlight using mechanical methods, with math formulas based on sun path charts used in combination with sensors or lenses that detect light level and maximize the natural daylight present in the space. Electric lighting is adjusted simultaneously, improving energy efficiency and reducing overall energy consumption.\n\nLutron Hyperion can reduce lighting energy use by 65% or more and is scalable from a single area or individual building to a campus with multiple buildings. The system can work with wireless radio window sensors, adding further functionality by accounting for varied conditions such as weather or shadows from adjacent buildings.\n\nSolarTrac's proprietary algorithms precisely predict the sun's position based on time, date, building location, and orientation of glass facades, in combination with rooftop radiometers that detect live conditions. The system can save up to 70% in lighting costs and alerts users of potential maintenance needs, with software supporting smartphone access and allowing up to 100 users simultaneously.\n\nSomfy's Animeo is made up of intelligent, scalable building controls, motor controls, local controls, and a full selection of sensors and additional accessories. Referring to a range of scalable daylighting systems, Animeo software automates management of natural light according to the position of the sun and glass façade orientation, with a variety of available Somfy weather sensors.\n\nHalcyon shades reduce 99.9% of harmful UV rays, reflect 80% of solar heat gain, and reduce glare by 97%, providing a return on investment in as little as two years in energy savings, with a 10 – 25% savings on a building's energy spend. Combined with Somfy Animeo, energy efficiency is improved by decreasing solar glare & HVAC demand and reducing electricity needed for lighting.\n\nThe single largest operating cost in U.S. commercial buildings is lighting, with lighting systems constituting one-third or more of total electrical energy costs. Additionally, 30% to 50% of U.S. office buildings' total electrical energy consumption is by lighting systems.\n\nDaylighting systems, if properly applied to new and existing buildings, can drastically reduce the energy consumption of Boston's buildings, while at the same time improving occupant comfort and productivity. A reduction in energy consumption would allow for improved energy efficiency, helping the City of Boston to attain its ambitious goal: using 100% carbon-free energy by 2050.\n\nIf you're interested in learning more or implementing any of the aforementioned daylighting systems, contact us today.", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "1b51cd43-083e-4977-9784-695544946b50", "url": "https://www.ver-tex.com/daylight-harvesting-a-carbon-free-boston/"}
{"text": "Jack Russell Terrier – Top 10 Facts (The Hollywood Dog)\n\nDeveloped in England some 300 years ago to hunt foxes, the Jack Russell Terrier, also known as the Parson Russell Terrier, is a lively, independent, and clever little dog. He's charming and affectionate, but he's also a handful to train and manage.\n\nThe energetic and spirited Jack packs a lot of personality into his small body. Loving, devoted, and endlessly amusing, he enjoys life, and all it has to offer. Given half a chance, he'll pursue his delights over fences and through the streets. He's incredibly intelligent, but his willful nature can make him difficult to train. Friendly toward people, he can be aggressive toward other dogs and any animal that resembles prey, including cats. His fearless nature puts him at risk when he decides to take on a bigger dog.\n\nThe Jack Russell Terrier, like many terriers, enjoys digging and can make quite a large hole in a short time. It' easier to train a dog to dig in a specific area than it is to break him of a digging habit.\n\nOne thing that you should absolutely know about Jack Russell terriers before you become a proud owner of one yourself is that they shed a lot, and by lot we mean A LOT. Don't worry that is normal – they need to shed in order to maintain a healthy coat.\n\nBe prepared to groom and brush them regularly – although how often and what manner of tools would be best for the job depends on the type of fur your Jack Russell has. Now, we know keeping your JRT happy and healthy could be a big darn challenge at times, so if you wanna learn more about grooming your Jack Russell, here's a fun and friendly book that works as perfect as a guide and gives you expert advice on the Jack Russell temperament, whether this energetic breed fits your lifestyle, how to train your dog to be a well-mannered companion, and much more.\n\nThey are so smart charming and definitely affectionate! They are super energetic they will do so many silly funny things to lift your spirits when you're down! They are so loyal and protective! My little one saved me from someone breaking into my apartment! He was so tough for such a small guy! I wish more ppl knew what a lovely breed they are; I miss mine so much! ❤️❤️🙏🙏\n\nWhere on earth did you get those specimens. I have had plenty and all looked better than those. Their ears should be tipped , tails cropped, smaller chests so they can go under ground. They are able to read their owners minds and most lovable of the terriers..so so smart.only the short coated shed. But not the broken coated which I currently have…no shedding. Best dogs ever.\n\nI had 2 jrts, bear was a rescue from a farm I rode at and tripod was rescued from a puppy mill as puppy. (May they both RIP) but the odd thing I found with both of them is that if someone was around them 24/7 or they had at least each other to be with they where happy to just loaf around the house and do nothing all day. It was odd because where we got bear from he was quite active all day and night. But when I took him home he was content to lay on my bed for 3 days straight only getting up to go outside. They can be very calm dogs if you know how to accommodate that type of lifestyle for them\n\nI've own jack Russells for the last 20 years. Harley lived to be 16 coco lived to be 19 and Brady lived to be 20 . All these facts are true. I love Jack Russells. We just acquired 2 puppies at thanksgiving. I love the energy they have. What I've learned is if you get a Jack Russell get 2 or more.\n\nLived with a Parson's JR – She was, out of the many canines I've lived with – the most intelligent / so quick to learn . . . and 'loved, learning! She 'got along' with other dogs in 'my pack' – and felines as well ~ as long as she was considered the leader of the pack! 🙂\n\nFirst there was Buck…because some kids came around with a box and I bought her for a dollar. 16+ years. Next, was Gypsy, because she was abandoned in a Bird Sanctuary and we rescued from the JRT rescue here, she lived 16 years.. Now, we have Dempsey…a Jack/Hound mix. We thought he was a regular size Jack from the pics…no his legs are about 22 inches long and he's all Jack attitude and runs like a racing hound. He was chained to a fence in Baltimore in the winter, severely underweight and dehydrated and finally removed. Took 6 months to make him our dog…now he is awesome, funny, brave, smart and cuddly.

{"text": "RC Rock Crawling Course Idea: 4 Easy DIY Ideas!\n\nIntroduction\n\nBuilding your own rock crawling course might seem tough. But with some handy supplies and great ideas, you can get a great result. It's up to you if you want the course to be complex or easy.\n\nSo that's why we have come up with RC rock crawling ideas.\n\nYou can simply put together leftover amazon boxes and some trash to create an indoor course idea. For outdoor course ideas, use dirt, wood, and small and big rocks to make it adventurous. Use spray paints and some fake objects to make the course interesting. You can create an obstacle course in your backyard.\n\nDon't worry! We will not leave you empty-handed. Let's discuss the ideas more descriptively!\n\n4 Amazing RC Rock Crawling Course Ideas,\n\nFirst of all, you need to set up a budget. We will provide you with both budget-friendly and costly crawler course ideas. The choice is yours!\n\nThe best fact about the rock crawling course is that you can even build it from the garbage.\n\nIt depends on you if you like the course indoors or outdoors. Outdoor courses can be easily changed or upgraded.\n\nWhenever you are ready for the idea, keep the supplies you need in hand.\n\nLet's jump into the ideas!\n\nIdea 1 of 4: Indoor Course From Garbage\n\nThis is an interesting crawling course idea. The stuff you need for this crawler course is mostly garbage.\n\nSo gather up things you don't need around the house right now!\n\nYou can use materials like spray paint, fake grass, 3D printed rocks, Amazon boxes, and foam from flat-packed furniture.\n\nYou also need some hot glue, duct tape, etc. You can use the same glue you use for RC car tires on this.\n\nFirst things first, use the cardboard boxes to create the structure. You can just hot glue them down.\n\nAfter creating a structure you need some plastic strips to lay over this. It will make the terrain smoother.\n\nJust dip those into the water and lay them over the boxes. Now, wait for them to dry.\n\nDid it dry off? Now use a glue solution all over the terrain. Now put on some sand all over the terrain.\n\nIt's time to lay down some paint over this. You can use different colors of spray paint. Put on different fake plastic objects to make the track more interesting.\n\nWe have some amazing products you can put on your track. Check them out!\n\nProduct 1\n\nProduct 2\n\nLet the paint dry and then put it on the fake grass. You can use 3D rocks to build different obstacles all over the terrain.\n\nWallah! You have made your first ever crawler course!\n\nIdea 2 of 4: Outdoor Wooden Course\n\nIf it's sunny out and you need a crawler adventure this course will give it to you!\n\nTo create this course you don't need anything fancy. Just some wood will do the job\n\nFor the starting you can make a small wooden gate for your RC truck. Keep the gate real simple. Pin up 3 pieces of wood to make it.\n\nFor the first landing pad, create a small field with some dirt, small logs, and branches.\n\nScatter these around so that the truck articulates over its first obstacle.\n\nAfter the first pad, we are going for a pit. You can make the pit 1.5 to 2 feet deep.\n\nWe will fill half of the pit with rock and another half with dirt. You can put down some pretty big rocks for this.\n\nMake sure the truck should have to maneuver over.\n\nNow, we will create a small mountain after the truck crosses the pit. Make a steep mountain structure with woods.\n\nNow you can fill the mountain with dirt and small logs. Use a long branch to create a bring which will connect the mountain to the ground.\n\nNow all you gotta do is create a finishing line.\n\nIdea 3 of 4: Muddy Outdoor Course\n\nYour RC truck will look better with some mud on it. So let's create a muddy crawler course.\n\nYou need the same supplies as before to make this course.\n\nTo start off, use two wooden sticks and create a ladder with small branches. Lay down the ladder on a pile of mud.\n\nAfter the ladder, you can create two ramps. One ramp will take you on top of a big log, another will get you down to a pit.\n\nThe pit should be filled with mud and dirt. Make sure the pit has enough rocks or branches so that the truck doesn't drown in the mud. Sometimes RC trucks wont move because of the mud.\n\nCreate a muddy way so that the truck can cross over the pit.\n\nYou can go for this course after the summer. In the rainy season, this course will look best.\n\nIdea 4 of 4: Backyard Rocky Course\n\nLet's make a rocky course for your RC truck right in your backyard. You just need to spend a little more time on this one!\n\nStarting off you need actual rocks with both small and big shapes. You can also use artificial grass or real grass for this course.\n\nTo start, make a wooden bridge. Put on a big rock so that the wooden bridge can be fixed. Test the angle out with your truck.\n\nAfter that put on some more big rocks and create a past. Use a blowdryer to remove all the leaves around.\n\nCreated a path? Now put on some small stones and sands on top of those rocks.\n\nIn the middle of the path create a little sandpit area. Make sure that area is under a shade so that it doesn't get muddy.\n\nAfter the end of the path, create the same wooden bridge to finish off!\n\nHere you go with your cheap and easy backyard crawling course!\n\nBut wait, you need to take some precautions before starting to build one of these courses!\n\nPrecautions You Need to Take Before Making a Course\n\nKeep in mind that you are going to work with big rocks and glue here.\n\nSo before everything, wear proper gloves. If you are creating a muddy course wear waterproof shoes.\n\nMake sure to keep a safe path for the drivers. The course should be safe to walk on. Avoid building a rocky course without a driver's path. Because drivers will not look at their feet most of the time.\n\nWhenever you are using big rocks make sure you have a helping hand.\n\nThat's all we had for you to offer today.\n\nFAQs\n\nWhat is the best crawler for my track?\n\nIt depends on what your track looks like. If you have a rocky track we will suggest you go for the Axial Jeep Wrangler RC crawler. The DEE RC Rock crawler is better for the muddy course. However, you can upgrade your truck by keeping track in mind.\n\nAre RC rock crawlers waterproof?\n\nYes, RC rock crawlers are fully water-resistant. You can go through mud, water, and watery dirt with your truck. But make sure not to go too deep inside the water.\n\nWhat crawler can go through the toughest track?\n\nHistory says it's the Traxxas TRX-4. This has a strong chassis to start with. It comes with one of the finest designed trucks. The only drawback of this truck is it costs comparatively more.\n\nFinal Words\n\nNow you know all about RC rock crawling ideas.\n\nOne last tip! You should create tracks with a theme, it will make driving more fun!", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "32c8a24f-2180-4584-94b8-7008e7623ca0", "url": "https://rcraces.com/rc-rock-crawling-course-ideas/"}
{"text": "How To Install Bathtub Ceramic Tile\n\nSimilarly,can you put tile directly on a bathtub?\n\nTiling the entirety of a plastic tub is a do-it-yourself-only project. A plastic tub is not a solid enough surface to adhere tile to, as there is too much flexibility, which means it is not rated for adhesion with the mastics and thinset mortars available with tile, with the exception of epoxy.\n\nAlso,what should i put down before installing ceramic tile? UnderIn this regard,should there be a gap between tub and tile?\n\nLeaving a 1/16″ gap between the tub and tile will prevent the tile from cracking when the tub expands. Plus, a 1/16″ gap allows the caulk to properly fill the space and waterproof the transition between the tile and tub or shower.\n\nWhat goes first tub or tile?\n\nIn your installation process, you should put the backer board down and tile the floor and the backsplash around the tub first, but leave off the row of tiles that directly surround the tub. Next, you'll install the tub, make it level, and connect all of the plumbing.\n\nThings to consider\n\nBelow are some things to consider when trying to figure out how to install bathtub ceramic tile.\n\nHow to Tile a Shower | Tile Prep and Installation\n\nHow do you prepare a tub surround for tile?\n\nTub or shower wall tile preparation:\n\nApply a layer of 1/2″ thick cement backer board to the wall studs.\n\nTape any seams and corners with fiberglass tape.\n\nApply thin-set adhesive over the fiberglass tape, and allow it to dry.\n\nRoll a waterproofing sealer over the walls, and allow the sealer to dry.\n\nHow do you fill gap between tub and floor? IfDo you need underlayment for tile floor? SomeCan you use thinsetHow to Set Tile Around a Tub – Bathroom Remodel\n\nHow far should shower tile go? Shower tiles should generally be approximately six feet and two inches high in the shower. This height covers the minimum of three-fourths of the shower to keep water flowing into the drain and not seeping into the walls.\n\nDo you install flooring before tub?\n\nProtect against floor scratches, cracks, stains and damage If the flooring is placed before the bathtub, it can lead to scratching or damaging the floor with trying to position a heavy object like a bathtub, so you can simply place it first and add the flooring and walling to make it more convenient.\n\nDo you tile first before installing shower? We always advise fitting the shower tray before tiling the walls or installing wall panels as this ensures a more watertight seal around the sides of the tray. Initially, it may be easier to get the tray level by adjusting the key corner legs first.\n\nWhat order should I tile my bathroom?\n\nWhy You Should Tile the Wall First On the flip side, tiling the walls first will help you dodge the mishaps and messes associated with tile and mortar. In order to have a better outcome with the walls first, you will need to consider how your tiled wall will hang over the floor.\n\nCan you tile over fiberglass tub surround? ExpertDoes mortar adhere to plastic?\n\nUnfortunately, none of the adhesives and mortars that are manufactured for use with tile projects are meant to be used with a plastic-based surface. As a result, the normal method of applying these materials will never work because they won't stick to plastic.\n\nWhat do you put on shower walls before tile?\n\nWhenever installing tile in any area of your house, you need a special substrate, or base layer. In showers, the standard substrate is tile backer, also called cement board or cement backer board.\n\nHow to Tile a Shower Wall | The Home Depot\n\nCan I use expanding foam under bathtub? Yes, expanding spray foam can be used under a bathtub. It can reduce coldness and flex in an existing install, but an improper application can result in additional problems. It's important to understand that the tried-and-true best practice for preventing flex in a newly installed bathtub is with a mortar slab.\n\nHow big of a gap can you fill with caulk?\n\nMeasure the size of the gap that needs to be filled. A transition from tile to drywall? The easiest way to transition from tile to drywall will be using what's called a Schluter Profile — it is a material often used by professional builders and usually adds a metal accent to your finish. These are premade metal bars that are designed to fit over the tiles' edges", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "dd2f1624-d0b7-4c24-b8d4-98021ae5ea9b", "url": "https://www.whyienjoy.com/how-to-install-bathtub-ceramic-tile/"}

{"text": "Hello. Welcome to the first \"in the community\" posts spotlighting members of the C++ and/or developer community. Today we meet Kenny Kerr and a Microsoft MVP who graciously agreed to \"go first\" 🙂\nKenny is a computer programmer with a bias toward Windows and C++.\n\nHello. Welcome to the first \"in the community\" posts spotlighting members of the C++ and/or developer community. Today we meet Kenny Kerr and a Microsoft MVP who graciously agreed to \"go first\"\n\nKenny is a computer programmer with a bias toward Windows and C++. He enjoys writing and teaching developers how to get the most out of Windows with C++. Kenny has published numerous articles about the Windows operating system, network security, and C++ for MSDN Magazine as well as other publications. He currently writes the monthly Windows with C++ column for the magazine. Microsoft has recognized Kenny's expertise in network and operating system security with the Microsoft MVP Award for security. He has also held the Microsoft MVP Award since 2007 for his contributions to the C++ development community. He recently published Direct2D Fundamentals on Pluralsight and is currently working on a second installment that will add coverage of Direct3D and XAML, animation, app and game performance optimizations, and much more.\n\nC++ is about power. It's the raw performance of C with the productivity of a modern language, making it easier to write large-scale apps.\n\nWhy C++?\n\nI love power tools. Drills, routers, and circular saws. I also like hand tools. Chisels, planes, and screwdrivers. That's a bit like C++. It has power tools like regular expressions and hash-based maps and there are hand tools like stack semantics, algorithms, and smart pointers. The C++ language allows you to pick the right tool for the job, whether it's a vector of shared_ptr types on Windows or a hand-rolled heap allocator for a tiny embedded system. The language doesn't prohibit you from switching paradigms or breaking out of abstractions, and it lets you use or create abstractions quite naturally.\n\nWhat do you like most about C++?\n\nHonestly, I love the reality that I can use or create abstractions that don't cost anything at run time. I can write clear and robust code without compromising performance. Classes, templates, and more recently things like perfect forwarding, move semantics, and many more all work together to allow increasingly complex systems to be written efficiently and far more simply.\n\nLeast?\n\nI don't really have a problem with any particular part of C++. I realize there are less desirable aspects of C++ but they have their footnotes in history and it is what it is.\n\nWhat advice would you give new C++ developers?\n\nDon't use features you don't understand. The beauty of C++ is that you can use as much or as little of the language as you desire. As your understanding of C++ grows, you will naturally begin to adopt new techniques and language features but don't rush it. Master the fundamentals. C and C++ are such valuable languages for the new developer because they sit so very close to the machine that you get a good sense for how everything really works. Once you wrap your head around the fundamentals of the machine and the OS, if any, you will be in a good position to improve your capabilities as a programmer by further and continued study of the C++ language.\n\nDo you have any favorite C++ authors or books?\n\nI tend to enjoy Stroustrup's books. I know his style is not for everyone and his books tend to be quite theoretical and exhaustive but that's what I look for in a textbook. If you are serious about learning C++ but really don't know anything about it then I would suggest you pick up a copy of Programming: Principles and Practice Using C++. Once you're off the ground pick up Scott Meyers' Effective C++ and More Effective C++ to stretch your understanding of the fundamental concepts of C++. Finally, as your use of C++ matures I would suggest skimming through C++ Coding Standards written by Herb Sutter and Andrei Alexandrescu. The latter wrote a fun book entitled Modern C++ Design that, while not so modern anymore, is still well worth reading.\n\nWhat do you think of the Visual C++ compiler in particular?\n\nI know that Microsoft can sometimes appears to be slow to implement the very latest standards but I would just remind folks that there is a lot more that goes into a compiler than parsing the latest and greatest revision of rvalue references. All of the optimizations and microprocessor-specific code generation that goes into the backend is so often overlooked by critics. I have spent a lot of time working with ARM microcontrollers on tiny embedded systems where I don't have the luxury of using Windows let alone Visual C++. I code everything on the metal (no OS) with ARM's own compiler. Their focus is on the backend to produce the best possible machine code, but as far as I can tell ARM hasn't even heard of C++11 yet. Sure, I could use GCC to get all the fancy C++11 features but my code generation would suffer and when you're coding on the metal you really can't afford to fool around with poor code generation. How does this relate to Visual C++? Microsoft provides a good balance of modern C++ language and library features with excellent backend code generators. I am always happy when I come back to Windows and get to use Visual C++ again.\n\nIf you want to be featured or want to recommend someone we should feature, drop us a hint on Facebook! Thanks! it was an unparalleled opportunity to be able to meet and learn from many C++ experts and to chat with other C++ enthusiasts and learn how others use the C++ language.\n\nYou can find information about the 2013 conference, including registration information, in the official announcement.

{"text": "Sonic Generations\n\nDescription :\n\nSega's Sonic The Hedgehog is a character just like Nintendo's Mario; both are iconic characters of that game maker. Sonic The Hedgehog is the character used by Sega as a character to be able to confront Mario. While Sega and Nintendo were competitors in the competitive market and made games, there were no permanent enemies, only endless benefits. So, the two of them shook hands with each other and ended up giving a gift that on the Nintendo 3DS platform, Sonic had the image for players to experience. That game was Sonic Generations – a game Sega produced to release on Nintendo's platform. This game is a game launched to celebrate the twenty years of the birth of Sonic The Hedgehog. This combination has released a game that is liked by players and experts. This game has sold 1.85 million copies, and until now, it is still a name that many people choose to play.\n\nThe first difference of this game compared to the previous games is from the graphics of the game; it has been improved to bring a better experience. Instead of being in a 2D graphics format like its seniors, this time, the player will experience an extremely realistic 3D graphic format. Players can easily interact more with the objects as well as many other things in the game. This game is designed in the style of 3D graphics is to match the functions of the Nintendo 3DS device. This game, with a different graphics style compared to the old games, should quickly attract a lot of players to try to experience the game.\n\nWhen players come to the game, players will experience the feeling of both the past and the present. A monster is attacking the world of Sonic and has opened the portal between the past and the future. So Sonic of the past went into that gate and came to the present world, to protect the timeline. The following distinction between the characters is made clear by the appearance of the characters, Sonic of the present is tall and thin, and Sonic of the past is smaller.", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "4aafdf42-fbe1-498a-b51d-e7306a6d888c", "url": "https://galaxyroms.net/console/nintendo-3ds/sonic-generations/"}

{"text": "Why I FINALLY Threw Away My Scale\n\nWe obsess over numbers. How much money do I make? How many square feet is my house? How many pounds do I weigh? We need a SERIOUS shift. We need to shift towards how things make us FEEL. Am I living a lifestyle that I love? Is my home a place of comfort and love? Do I wake up in the morning and feel great about my body? THESE are the questions we should be asking, and in turn, making shifts in our conscious behavior as needed.\n\nI tell my friends and family all the time 'It doesn't matter what the scale says it matters about how you feel'. But there I am, day after day obsessively weighing in. I can honestly wake up and look at myself in the mirror and say 'I look amazing today' and then quicker than a shake of a lamb's tale say 'I wonder how much I weigh today?'. And if that number doesn't coincide with where I thought I should be, it turns things around just as quickly.\n\nWHO CARES?!?! Does it really matter if I have gone up a pound or two or down a pound or two if when I look in the mirror I am happy with what I see? Does it really matter that I should 'take 2 pounds off for clothes and one pound off for the coffee and water I had already' to really get my \"true weight\" if I love the way I look? Does it really matter what that number is if my body is capable of doing 200 pound squats and 50 pushups and 25 pound bicep curls?\n\nThe answer is so obvious right?! Then why do I (and maybe you too) care so much about what that number is? We shouldn't. It is unhealthy for my physical and mental well being to obsess over that number. It makes you want to eat less, eat different, take pills, binge sweat – whatever the reaction it has on you, it needs to stop.\n\nSo I have stopped. I have ridded my home of a scale. Instead, I am going to wake up each morning and ask myself how I physically feel. And then I will look at myself in the mirror while I'm getting ready for my day and ask myself how do I physically look in MY eyes. And when in doubt, I'm going to remind myself of five things I did this week in the gym to prove that the scale doesn't run me, I do. So the fact that I can throw a mean right cross or killer roundhouse kick, or that I can do upside down pushups until the cows come home, or that I can throw my nieces in the air a hundred times to make them giggle. My body is more physically fit at 37 than I ever have been and I need to celebrate that. Every day. Screw the numbers. F the scale.

{"text": "It has been called the new 'Humans of New York' after the photo blog series that documents stories of everyday New Yorkers. But the 'Women of Silicon Valley' blog is so much more than just an interesting and diverse story-telling platform, it is a vital resource for women who are grossly underrepresented in the tech industry.\n\nThe series was started by Lea Coligado, a Computer Science student at Stanford University who shares in an introduction video on the website that states women represent only 12% of the software industry today. Yikes!\n\n\"I'm starting Women of Silicon Valley because I want to celebrate these living—and thriving—examples of female success, these rebels against the numbers and the gender norms. I want women who are sitting on the fence about Computer Science to get as inspired as I was by these role models, and hopefully, to see that at its heart tech is exciting, immensely powerful and so, so worth it,\" she says.\n\n\"These women are unique. [They are the] amazing few who've persevered through creepy, belittling, and outright sexist adversity to carve out their own niche, to affect billions of consumers through their engineering and entrepreneurship. In the same way Humans provides snapshots into the lives of New Yorkers, Women of Silicon Valley is meant to showcase the lives of females working in the heart of the tech industry.\"\n\nThe series is still in its infancy, but has already attracted a considerable following, emphasizing the need for such a community of women. While the female to male ratio in tech is abysmally low, as evidenced by the number of diversity reports released from some of the major tech companies in 2014, it seems women want to be represented in all areas and the best way to do that is to encourage each other, and show the younger generation that women in tech DO exist!\n\nThe WOSV Facebook page is a great place to see all the new interviews that are being posted in the series and get a glimpse of how women are contributing to this industry.\n\nIt's not hard to see how women are going to continue making an impact in tech, all you have to do is take a step back and look at how the younger generation of girls are learning about coding. The movement to empower tweens and teens about computer science is growing every day, and there is evidence everywhere you look that this is not going to be just a male-dominated arena for very long.\n\nIn February, more than 70 girls from 5 cities around the world came together for an international hack-a-thon event called 'Ignite: Women Fueling Science & Technology' created by Silicon Valley company Global Fund For Women where the theme of the event was to use coding to find solutions to long-standing social problems. The winners of the event were a group of girls from Brazil aged 18-22 who created an app called 'Não Me Calo' which in Portuguese means 'I Will Not Shut Up'.\n\nIt is best described as the Yelp for ranking public spaces based on their safety for women and girls. They use mapping technology to identify and rank venues that allow gender-based abuse and harassment to persist and hope this innovative app will create useful data for governments, authorities and business owners to better serve the half of the population that is disproportionately affected by street harassment and violence.\n\nThis hack-a-thon is certainly not the only event or organization tapping into a generation that was largely left behind in the tech boom of yesteryear. In fact today is it estimated there over 100 million unfilled STEM jobs in the United States alone, showing employers and businesses that this industry is growing so fast, they cannot afford to exclude girls from the tech world any longer.\n\nIt is these examples that will eventually change the ratio, but for now the number remains pitiful. These girls are also examples of how they are allowing tech spaces to cater to specific women's issues and even solve them in ways other industries cannot.\n\nWhen you look throughout history, the women have always been part of tech (think Ada Lovelace – the woman regarded as the world's first computer programmer), but largely ignored by society because of its male dominance today. When you think of tech geniuses, billionaires and whizz-kids, names like Gates, Zuckerberg, Dorsey etc come to mind. But the conversation is slowly starting to change with names like Sandberg and Miller being added to the mix in a powerful way.\n\nA new documentary called 'Code: Debugging the Gender Gap' directed, produced and edited by three women, Robin Hauser Reynolds, Staci Hartman and Christie Herring, seeks to explore reasons for the gender gap and the digital divide.\n\nOne of the women featured in the film who is also part of the WOSV blog series is Tracey Chou, software engineer and tech lead at Pinterest.\n\n\"I've started to understand that there are structural problems within the field and that these external indignities have nothing to do with my personal shortcomings, I am less hard on myself. I've come to better appreciate and celebrate my own successes,\" she shared with WOSV.\n\n\"Tech jobs are growing three times faster than our colleges are producing computer science graduates. By 2020 there will be one million unfilled software engineer jobs in the USA. 'Code' aims to inspire change in mindsets, in the educational system, in startup culture, and the way women see themselves in the field of coding,\" says a press release about the documentary.\n\n\"It takes about a generation to change a stereotype. As director of 'Code' I hope to inspire our audience to begin that change. Change in the way our school system values computer science education, the way we think of a programmer, and change in the way women and people of color view themselves in the tech field. I hope the documentary will encourage more people in tech to join the movement to make the industry more inclusive and thus more efficient for all,\" said director Robin Hauser Reynolds.\n\nIt is about the movement for inclusivity. The merits speak for themselves, instead we need to emphasize how gender should not be part of the equation when it comes to filling jobs. The awesome Women of Silicon Valley blog series, and the 'Code' documentary are a vital voice in the movement to make tech accessible for all.\n\nWhile the numbers remain low, our hopes are high simply because there are people actively working to change the ratio. Take a look at the trailer for 'Code: Debugging The Gender Gap' below and see how the women in tech today are changing the world they", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "512c2901-97eb-4384-9f81-36b64948e338", "url": "https://www.girltalkhq.com/women-of-silicon-valley-is-the-movement-we-have-needed-in-tech-for-a-long-time/"}

{"text": "Analysis based on the most recent inflation forecasts by the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) shows that the poorest students will be more than £1000 worse off this year than in the academic year of 2020-2021.\n\nThe analysis found that the government's maintenance loan has not kept pace with rising inflation.\n\nThis has caused a cut in loan purchasing power of around £250 per year for students in England compared to previous predictions.\n\nThe maintenance support has been adjusted based on forecasted inflation rather than actual inflation, which has risen higher.\n\nThere is currently no government fiscal mechanism to adjust the amount of maintenance support based on actual inflation as opposed to forecasted inflation.\n\nKate Ogden, a senior research economist at the IFS, said: \"While others are benefiting from extra government support, students have been left in the cold. Merely because of errors in inflation forecasts, the poorest students will be more than £1000 worse off this academic year than in 2020/21. This could lead to significant hardship for many this winter.\"\n\nStudent maintenance loans are adjusted with forecast RPIX inflation. RPIX is a measure of inflation in the UK, equivalent to the all-items Retail Price Index and excluding mortgage interest payments.\n\nIf forecast RPIX inflation is less than actual inflation, the real value of maintenance loan entitlements will instead fall.\n\nBen Waltmann, a senior research economist at the IFS, said: 'Using forecast inflation to uprate maintenance loan entitlements makes sense, but having no mechanism to correct errors makes no sense at all. The government should ensure maintenance loans are uprated consistently rather than allowing a large and essentially random reduction in the value of loans to become baked in.'\n\nFor university students domiciled in England, government support for living costs is given out in the form of maintenance loans, and students can take out these maintenance loans in addition to loans for tuition fees.\n\nThe amount to which a student can borrow is measured against their parents' income and in this academic year, students from the poorest families studying outside London and not living with their parents are entitled to a maximum maintenance loan of £9,706.\n\nAfter a student graduates, they must then make loan repayments from any earnings above a threshold, which is currently £27,295.\n\nLoan repayments stop either when they have paid off their loans, or once 30 years have elapsed", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "ee5851f5-9be1-46e5-8cbe-1457486dfd04", "url": "https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/news/poorest-students-1000-worse-off-this-year-093800059.html"}
{"text": "Painting Maintenance: Effective Ways to Keep Your Walls Looking Great\n\nAug 8\n\nIf you're like most people, you probably don't consider painting maintenance until something goes wrong. And by then, it's often too late. In this blog post, we'll discuss how to keep your walls looking great for years to come!\n\nSimple Ways to Maintain the Condition of Your Exterior Wall Paint\n\nClean the Walls\n\nOne of the most important things you can do to keep your exterior painting in good condition is to clean the walls on a regular basis. This will aid in the removal of any dirt, dust, or grime that has become embedded in the paintwork. Scrub the surface gently, especially in high-traffic areas, with a soft cloth or brush and mild detergent. When finished, rinse the area with clean water and allow the wall to dry completely.\n\nTrees and Shrubs Need to be Pruned\n\nAnother way to keep your exterior wall paints looking great is to trim trees and shrubs. This will aid in keeping your paint job neat and clean. It will also help to keep your painting equipment in good condition. If you have any questions about how to properly trim trees and shrubs, contact a professional painting contractor.\n\nLook at the Walls\n\nIt is critical to inspect the exterior surfaces of your home's walls on a regular basis. This enables you to detect issues early and prevent them from worsening. Keep the following in mind when inspecting the walls:\n\nCracks: Minor cracks are rarely a cause for concern. However, if you notice any cracks on the surface of the walls that are wider than a quarter of an inch, you should have them examined by a professional, especially if you notice them throughout your entire home.\n\nPeeling Paints: Peeling paint usually indicates that the paint is old and should be replaced with a new coat. Touch-up paint can help revitalize your walls.\n\nWater Damage: Water damage can cause a wide range of problems, so it's critical to detect it as soon as possible.\n\nStains or Discolorations: Check the walls for stains or discoloration. If you notice any, it is best to seek professional advice.\n\nPaint Retouching\n\nThe exterior paint on your home will inevitably fade, chip, and peel over time. But don't despair! One of the simplest ways to do so is to use a paintbrush or a roller to touch up the paint on your walls. This will assist in concealing any small areas that have been damaged or show signs of wear and tear.\n\nFinally, if you want to ensure that your home's exterior paint is in good condition, you can hire a professional painter to come out and touch up the paint for you. This is usually a low-cost option that can save you a lot of time and effort in the long run. You can be confident that the painting services they offer will do an excellent job of updating the look and style of your exterior walls.\n\nLook for Mold and Mildew Signs\n\nMold and mildew can cause significant damage to your home if left unchecked. There are, thankfully, a few things you can do to keep them at bay.\n\nYou must act quickly if you notice any discoloration on your walls or spots that appear to be growing. You can use a store-bought cleaner or mix equal parts water and vinegar to make your own. It's critical to keep your walls clean and dry after you've removed the mold and mildew.\n\nIf you live in a humid climate, you should consider purchasing a dehumidifier. This will help to keep the air in your home dry, reducing the likelihood of mold and mildew growth.", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "33bef3c4-d0a4-4e65-9e7e-6c5dec767ad4", "url": "https://paintingdaily.digital/2022/08/08/painting-maintenance-effective-ways-to-keep-your-walls-looking-great"}
{"text": "The iPhone spy on users. Named four ways to spy on users of Apple smartphones\n\nApple smartphones have features that violate the user's privacy by transferring his data to third parties.\n\nThe iPhone Spy On Users\n\nActivity Tracking\n\nApple does not hide the fact that its gadgets have a function with which absolutely all installed services track user actions. iPhone apps collect data from other apps and browsers for advertising purposes—and sell that information to third parties.\n\nAd snooping starts at the initial launch of any application. When opened, the user will encounter a pop-up window asking for permission to track activities – the system will offer two options: \"Ask the application not to track\" and \"Allow\".\n\nIt is recommended that you disable tracking user actions – this will not affect the operation of the application in any way. The user will be able to use all the features of the service without restrictions and at the same time keep his data to himself.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn order to prevent tracking on iPhone, iPad, or iPod Touch, you need to open \"Settings\", go to the \"Privacy\" section, and open \"Tracking\", disable the feature for each application separately. At the same time, it is not recommended to disable \"Tracking requests by applications\" – this way the user will stop receiving requests, and this does not guarantee that the application does not consider it necessary to \"allow itself\" to monitor the user's actions on its own.\n\nThe iPhone Spy On Users\n\nWeird Permissions\n\nThe Privacy section also provides a list of system apps and services that third-party apps can access. At the same time, permissions for some applications may be redundant, for example, if the meditation service asks the user to access contacts or a microphone.\n\nTo prevent third-party services from accessing, for example, the camera, you need to open the \"Camera\" item in the \"Privacy\" section and check which applications are allowed to use this function. You must disable this feature for all services that are not related to taking photos or videos. Similar manipulations must be done with each item in the menu to minimize the risks of surveillance.\n\nThe iPhone Spy On Users\n\nPrivacy Statement\n\nWith iOS and iPadOS 15.2, Apple smartphones and tablets now have an App Privacy Report section in their privacy settings that shows the user what personal data each installed service collects.\n\nYou can find the \"Privacy Report\" at the very bottom of the \"Privacy\" section. The \"Data and sensor access\" section will show which applications and how often they request access to the location, contacts, files, microphone, or camera of the gadget. This will help detect the \"strange behavior\" of an application that receives more data than it needs to fully work.\n\nIf the user does not like excessively frequent requests from the application, he can deny access to a particular section according to the instructions in the previous section.\n\n\"Network activity of applications\" shows the network activity of the programs installed on the device, namely the number of connections to the network, as well as the domains accessed by the service. This report will help the user understand where the third-party application is uploading data.\n\nThe iPhone Spy On Users\n\nTracking from Google on iPhone\n\nDespite the fact that the iPhone runs on Apple services, this does not prevent Google from conducting exactly the same surveillance as on Android smartphones. Apple smartphone users with an active Google account on at least one app, such as YouTube, are advised to check their location history on Google Maps and prevent the company from tracking them.\n\nIn order for Google to stop tracking the geolocation of the smartphone and its owner, you need to go to the service website, log in and go to the \"Chronology\" section in the side menu. Next, you should click on the \"Location History\" button at the bottom of the screen and disable this feature.\n\nIt is also recommended to enable the automatic deletion of data after three months.\n\nThis is our website where we will provide you the best content about mobile laptop electric vehicle and electric bike.Our goal is to provide information on new technologies coming to the international market.", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "085085f4-2e79-494c-896e-74541921c00f", "url": "https://thetechburner.com/the-iphone-spy-on-users-dangerous-silent-feature/"}
{"text": "of Concordia Lutheran Mission\n\nLike this:\n\nLike this:\n\nThere is a series of delightful mystery stories and novels about a 12th-century Benedictine monk, Caedfael. Brother Caedfael is the herbalist for his monastery in Shrewsbury…and he also is a detective. There is PBS series based upon several of this series, starring Derek Jacobi. There are eighteen books in this fictional series written by Ellis Peters. In one scene Brother Caedfael and a young brother, Mark, come upon someone who has been murdered:\n\n\"Mark stood quiet and still, staring down in undismayed compassion. \"I wonder had he wife and children,\" he said at last. Caedfael marked the first focus of one fledgling priest's concern, and approved it. Christ's first instinct might have been much the same. Not: \"Unshriven, and in peril!\" not even: \"When did he last confess and find absolution?\" but: \"Who will care for his little ones?\"\n\nThe speculation about the victim's soul is interesting, sounding like care but not needed as only God knows. I think it does show forth a hypocritical piety. True piety is in the fledgling priest's question, \"Who will care for his little ones?\" Caedfael and Mark carry through with this concern in the story…Lent is about the Lord's free gift of forgiveness for us sinners. Fasting and praying are good… and this scene from this story shows us again the importance of almsgiving, caring for those in sorrow and pain in \"undismayed compassion\". The Lord calls us to be resolute in His compassion.\n\nLike this:\n\nAnd they have conquered (Satan) by the blood of the Lamb and by the word of their testimony, for they loved not their lives even unto death. Revelation 12:11\n\nAbout Perpetua and Felicitas and their Companions\n\nAt the beginning of the third century, the Roman emperor Septimus Severus forbade conversions to Christianity. Among those disobeying that edict were Perpetua, a young noblewoman, and her maidservant Felicitas. Both were jailed at Carthage in North Africa along with three fellow Christians. During their imprisonment, Perpetua and Felicitas witnessed to their faith with such conviction that the officer in charge became a follower of Jesus. After making arrangements for the well-being of their children, Perpetua and Felicitas were executed on March 7, 203. Tradition holds that Perpetua showed mercy to her captors by falling on a sword because they could not bear to put her to death. The story of this martyrdom has been told ever since as an encouragement to persecuted Christians.\n\nWriting for Perpetua and Felicitas, Martyrs\n\nThe crowd jumped to its feet so they could watch Perpetua and Felicitas move to where they had been told and see the sword pierce their bodies, thus making their eyes partner in the murder. But first they kissed one another, that they might consummate their martyrdom with the kiss of peace, then all the martyrs, immoveable and silently, received the sword-thrust, especially Saturus, who also had first climbed the ladder. He was waiting for Perpetua and was the first to give up his spirit. So that she might taste some pain, being pierced between the ribs, she cried out loudly, and she herself placed the wavering right hand of the youthful gladiator to her throat. Such a woman could not have been killed unless she herself had willed it, because she was feared by the impure spirit.\n\nO most brave and blessed martyrs! O truly called and chosen for the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ, who exalts and honors whomever He chooses! We ought to read these recent accounts for the edification of the Church, no less than the older ones, so that new virtues also may testify that one and the same Holy Spirit is always operating even until now, with God the Father Omnipotent, and His Son, Jesus Christ, our Lord, to whom belongs the glory and infinite power, forever and ever. Amen.\n\nAn early Christian writer, Tertullian (c. 160 – c. 220) famously penned \"the blood of the martyrs is the seed of the Church.\" The first church buildings were erected over the sites of martyrdom, as was the case of Perpetua and Felicitas after Christianity became a legal religion after AD312.\n\nWe erect church buildings in our day after a church building committee has taken in consideration all sorts of factors but this one is major: visibility with good parking. Now parking is important and convenient. But it is a sobering reminder that the first basilicas, etc. were not built according to convenience, but to honor the witness of the martyrs. Martyrdom is not convenient, only expedient for the persecutor, or so such a person, government etc. thinks.\n\nFor a long time now we have marketed convenience in our churches. This convenience Christianity was to make it easier for a person to join. I remember an eastern European Lutheran pastor, who served under the atheistic, Communist East Germany, saying he was rather shocked by padded pews here in our country. Now we are shocked that 'all of a sudden', Christians are no longer welcome to the world's table. We issued convenient entreaties for our churches and our services, and 'ministries', only to discover no one cared.\n\nWhy? As we made church life a bowl full of cherries, so we made convenient the Lord's precious truths. The invitation on many church street signs has, \"Everyone Welcome\". It's is true, but it became \"everyone welcome\" without repentance and catechesis (education). The Lord's Supper became a happy meal, not the giving of His Body and Blood for forgiveness and strengthening of faith and sanctification. Would anyone risk martyrdom for our inalienable right to pot-lucks, picnics and positive experiences? We wanted to fit in and found out we were not faithfully fit. We put the light of the Lord under a bushel basket. Biblical illiteracy is at an all-time low.\n\nPerpetua and her companions were bright with Christ's own light, that is the joy of the grace of forgiveness in the God who died and rose for us all: this is the heart of Lent. I heard a janitor in a Lutheran church in East Berlin, under the thumb of Communism, state that at that time Church does not leave the four walls of the church building. We still do not have those constraints. Maybe Perpetua and her companions were bringing the light of the Gospel outside of their Services where it was lit. Lord, bring forth in our lives a witness to your Gospel, your salvation , to You, O Savior of mankind.\n\nLet us pray:\n\nO God the King of saints, who strengthened your servants Perpetua and Felicitas and their companions to make a good confession, staunchly resisting, for the cause of Christ, the claims of human affection, and encouraging one another in their time of trial: Grant that we who cherish their blessed memory may share their pure and steadfast faith, and win with them the palm of victory; through Jesus Christ our Lord, who lives and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit, one God, for ever and ever.\n\nLike this:\n\nSermon Texts: The Gospel reading, (Matt. 6:3–4, 6, 17–18). and 1 Corinthians 9:Years ago, Natalie's Father died during Lent. We were up in New Jersey and family and friends were standing around somewhere, maybe church, and they were lightly chatting about what they gave up for Lent, as if they were talking about the latest football or basketball game. What is the purpose of fasting, praying and almsgiving? Jesus knows there is great temptation to show off about our spirituality to be seen by others: as it was then, is now. This is not the purpose of fasting, praying and almsgiving says Jesus, for then we have our reward: the adulation and praise of the world, by which the Church must not be led and is not fed. The world rewards itself yearly with award shows even with rewards for good deeds.\n\nThe world thinks itself quite 'spiritual', even using denial, but self-denial is a lot harder than denial. The purpose of self-denial teaches Jesus is to be seen by the Lord, our heavenly Father, for then He is our reward. He is our shield and great reward. He is our mighty fortress. The purpose of the Lenten discipline, for 40 days and nights…and other times as well…is to keep our eyes and hearts on the upward call of God in Christ Jesus, looking to Jesus the pioneer and perfector of our faith, who bore the cross for our justification, our Captain in the well fought fight.\n\nSt. Paul wrote this encouragement and challenge to the Church in Corinth, 1 Corinthians 10: 24 Do you not know that in a race all the runners run, but only one receives the prize? So run that you may obtain it. 25 Every athlete exercises self-control in all things, As a resident of Corinth in A.D. 50-52, he had probably witnessed the Isthmian Games in the spring of A.D. 51. This prestigious event, second only to the Olympic Games, was celebrated every two years about ten miles from Corinth. The basic athletic events included racing, wrestling, jumping, boxing, hurling the javelin, and throwing the discus. Paul begins with an illustration from the footraces in the stadium. A number of runners competed in each event, but only one could win the prize. The analogy to the Christian life is, of course, imperfect, for in the race all believers are prize winners. But Paul uses the analogy only to the exertion and self-discipline required of the successful runner. He challenges the Corinthians: \"Run that you may win\" (9:24).\n\nThe other purpose of the Lenten discipline is keeping our fighting trim. When my Father was in the FBI, he didn't particularly care for his physical because he had to be a certain weight as a special agent in the Bureau. Our souls can become overweight with the love of the world and the world is ever too much with us.\n\nThe world seeks to be praised And honored by the mighty, Yet never once reflects That they are frail and flighty. But what I truly prize Above all things is He, My Jesus, He alone— What is the world to me?\n\nFasting, prayer and almsgiving is the discipline of getting in shape as His Church, the Church militant. 1 Corinthians 9:24Do By so disciplining himself, Paul's faith was active and alive in Christ in loving service to all. If he were to live a life of self-indulgence, he would endanger not only the salvation of others, but also his own. Spirituality is not about our spiritual jollies, that's just narcissism, and worse: hypocrisy, play acting… The root word of discipline is disciple, so we are prepared for our everyday lives living as the Body of Christ, His Church. \"…if the bugle gives an indistinct sound, who will get ready for battle?Jesus is as clear as Uncle Sam: I want you every man woman and child…but He does not point at us but points to His Wounds for us and our salvation.\n\nThe purpose of self-denial and discipline is also for battling for the souls of others in the clear sound of the Lord's grace, mercy and peace for sinners. Giving up on satiation of food, we then want ever more the Bread of Life and Lord, open thou my lips. Giving up our words which does not create, redeem, and sanctify the world, we are focused on His Word, incarnate, written and heard Who alone created, redeemed and sanctified you and I. Yet our speech and prayers can guide the hungry man to His Feast. Giving up money, we can help our neighbor in all manner of services.\n\nIs discipline difficult? Of course!For the moment all discipline seems painful rather than pleasant, but later it yields the peaceful fruit of righteousness to those who have been trained by it.Given the military associations with discipleship in the Bible, St. Paul's advice is sound to Timothy: \"No soldier gets entangled in civilian pursuits, since his aim is to please the one who enlisted him.\"This was written to a pastor…and for us as well. We can easily be entangled in civilian pursuits in the world to our detriment. I think of fasting, almsgiving and prayer, the greatest of these are prayer. For prayer, like love, has no end. And the discipline is prayer, as Augustine wrote, fasting and almsgiving are wings of prayer: taking it to the Lord in prayer. Run the race. Remember:\n\nWe are called to please Him who was pleased to enlist us in Holy Baptism into His Church, the church militant, and out of the armies of the devil and the antichrist and to fight for the lost. As in Colossians, For in Him all the fulness of God was PLEASED to dwell. He is pleased to save us into His forces. As we sing at Christmas, \"Pleased as man with man to dwell/Jesus our Emmanuel\" (Hark! The Herald Angels Sing). Yet, we can become AWOL, absent without leave, run away from the Lord we love. Doing so in military and one is faced with punishments. We are too. But when we return to the Lord, repent, saying what I did was wrong, He is slow to anger and abounding in steadfast love and mercy to restore us.\n\nLent has been practiced for a thousand years or more, a training period on earth a learning, discipling, praying for the joy of Easter and Baptism…for living in the world but not for the world, looking to our Captain of the well fought fight.\n\nA noble army, men and boys, the matron and the maid, around the Savior's throne rejoice, in robes of light arrayed. They climbed the steep ascent of heaven, through peril, toil and pain; O God, to us may grace be given, to follow in their train.\n\nLike this:\n\nLike this:\n\nAfter school murders, this time at a college, the Governor's point person said that, Our schools are a sanctuary and they should be safe. I agree. The Governor's solution is gun control, but government can not speak to the real problem, such as, self-control, since so much of current culture is out of control.\n\nWhen we contemplate the idea that all schools should be a \"sanctuary\" and safe, I don't think that many schools are safe in any class. I will not write here about leftist ideologies in the curricula, but the old-fashioned problem of peer pressure. Sanctuary's root word is the Latin, \"sanctus\", At one time a major problem in a school was chewing gum, now it's birth control. Another problem was not getting in line, now it's getting high. There were always bullies in a school, but now it's a twitter mob and social network bullies…by the thousands. One time a concern was piercing one's ears, now it's cutting off body parts…I could go on. There is little that is holy at all in our schools. Peers' are educated by their peers is the bitter fruit of the '60s' revolutions: the blind leading the blind\". Lutheran pastor and professor, Dr. Kurt Marquardt, in the context of the Church pointedly about lack of self-control in children teaching their elders in 1978:\n\nWho, after all, could respect an institution (church) which is, after two thousand years' experience, so confused about its functions as to say, in effect: \"Dear children, help us! We are no longer sure about what we ought to be doing. Perhaps you might have some good ideas?\" Who could possibly take seriously the play-worship prefixed with that horrid word, \"experimental\"? The fact is that no healthy, viable society lets its children arbitrate its values. It is for the elders of the tribe to guard its cultural heritage and to transmit it solemnly to the younger generation-never vice versa. Also in our society the problem is not with the youth but with their elders.\n\nOur children should be taught by adults…faithful and grown-up. The Lord wants us feed the sheep, not experiment with rats. And if there is nothing of \"sanctus\" in a school, then it is not safe. Parents are removing their children from the public schools for an education with teachers who teach the truth in love. We need schools where the Lord is confessed…not the culture. This is good.\n\nLike this:\n\nI think the best Valentine's Day card is Luther's Rose which he created as his seal. which features a red heart in the middle with the Cross in the middle of the heart. As Luther explained, The cross symbolizes the death of sin and the redness of the heart made alive in Christ. Red also reminds us of God's agape, love for us all in His only-begotten Son who shed His blood that we be made pure in His mercy, with the gold ring of heaven. This reminds me of marriage and the wedding feast of the Lamb. A blessed St. Valentine's Day!\n\nThe full explanation by Fr. Luther of his seal:\n\nFirst, there is a black cross in a heart that remains its natural color. This is to remind me that it is faith in the Crucified One that saves us. Anyone who believes from the heart will be justified (Romans 10:10). It is a black cross, which mortifies and causes pain, but it leaves the heart its natural color. It doesn't destroy nature, that is to say, it does not kill us but keeps us alive, for the just shall live by faith in the Crucified One (Romans 1:17). The heart should stand in the middle of a white rose. This is to show that faith gives joy, comfort, and peace—it puts the believer into a white, joyous rose. Faith does not give peace and joy like the world gives (John 14:27). This is why the rose must be white, not red. White is the color of the spirits and angels (cf. Matthew 28:3; John 20:12). This rose should stand in a sky-blue field, symbolizing that a joyful spirit and faith is a beginning of heavenly, future joy, which begins now, but is grasped in hope, not yet fully revealed. Around the field of blue is a golden ring to symbolize that blessedness in heaven lasts forever and has no end. Heavenly blessedness is exquisite, beyond all joy and better than any possessions, just as gold is the most valuable and precious metal.", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "be45fa33-5d47-4003-bff3-cac72fa59a0d", "url": "https://concordiaandkoinonia.wordpress.com/"}

{"text": "What do you do at Christmas?\n\nChristmas is a family occasion where we gather around Christmas trees after a Christmas dinner of roast turkey and stuffing to open up presents after listening to the Queen's Speech. True or False?\n\nChristmas is a time spent with friends, partying and clubbing in silly party hats and wishing each other Merry Christmas at the stroke of midnight. True or False?\n\nEven if certain cultures don't celebrate Christmas in the same way, they must surely know about the family Christmas of the west, thanks to the omnipresent Hollywood films. True or False?\n\nPerhaps it is much harder for Hollywood to influence our family routines and traditions, but its impact is often much more clearly seen in our perceptions of romance and how we conduct our social lives and relationships. In Japan and Korea, Christmas Eve shares more in common with the Valentine's Day we celebrate in Europe, where couples meet for a romantic candlelight dinner over which they exchange presents and whispers of Merry Christmas.\n\nSo if Christmas is like Valentine's Day, what then do Koreans and Japanese do on Valentine's Day? Well, here's where local interpretations of European festivals take a slightly interesting turn. Valentine's Day in Korea and Japan is now set aside as a day when women buy men chocolates as a declaration of their feelings. While Japanese women of all ages buy beautifully packaged gourmet chocolates for their partners, it was the teenagers that gave Valentine's Day its real significance. As it is not common for women in Korea and Japan to make the first move in expressing their interest in the opposite sex, this special day meant that women could take control and let the men they fancy know about it. This saw tonnes of chocolates delivered in truckloads to male celebrities making the tabloid news every year.\n\nIn order to avoid the threat to face that men might face when confronted with chocolates from a woman he's not quite interested in, the Japanese created White Day a month after Valentine's Day (14th March) for men to reciprocate with white gifts such as white chocolates, marshmallows or cookies, and jewellery after having a month to think about the advances on Valentine's Day. An absence of gifts from the men they have showered with chocolates on Valentine's Day can be taken as a form of polite rejection. In Korea, the 14th April has been named Black Day – a day when those who did not receive any presents on Valentine's Day or White Day get together to celebrate being single.\n\nBut I digress. Christmas in Japan and Korea may not be a bank holiday, but it certainly is a chance to celebrate, a chance for shops to get out their fairy lights and fight to attract customers with the best decorations. In Singapore, Orchard Road, the main shopping street, is decorated with the most lavish lights, and every shopping centre competes to win the title for the best decorated. Unlike many countries in Asia, Christmas day in Singapore is indeed a bank holiday, but it isn't quite the family occasion it is in the United Kingdom. So friends get together and party the night away.\n\nThe Spanish, on the other hand, certainly know how to make a holiday last. Presents aren't exchanged until the 5th and 6th of January, during the festival of the Three Kings, when floats grace the streets of villages and sweets are thrown into the crowds as they reenact the coming of the three kings.\n\nHow do you celebrate Christmas?\n\nHow do your students celebrate Christmas?\n\nWho do they celebrate it with?\nWhat traditions do they have? What typical foods do they eat?\n\nIf you teach a multilingual, multicultural class, this could be a great chance for a discussion and some lovely sharing to take place.\n\nIf you teach a monolingual class, how about a task? Have different groups of students conduct research online about the different Christmas traditions of different countries and report back in the form of a presentation.3 thoughts on \"What do you do at Christmas?\"\n\nI am Finish and working in Ukraine.

{"text": "Following the revelation of government data gathering program PRISM in June, Apple released a statement on customer privacy that suggested the company was unable to access or decrypt iMessage and FaceTime conversations.\n\nAccording to researchers who presented at the Hack the Box conference in Kuala Lumpur (via Macworld), it is actually possible for someone inside Apple to intercept messages because the company has access to public iMessage keys.\n\nThe company's claim that iMessage is protected by unbreakable encryption is \"just basically lies,\" said Cyril Cattiaux, who has developed iOS jailbreak software and works for Quarkslab, a penetration testing and reverse engineering company in Paris.\n\nThe researchers emphasized they have no indication that Apple or the government is reading iMessages, only that it would be possible to do so.\n\nTo encrypt iMessages, Apple utilizes public key cryptography, which means that every Apple device is assigned both a private key and a public key. When an iMessage is sent, it requests the public key of the recipient's device to encrypt the message, which is then decrypted by a private key upon receipt.\n\nBecause Apple manages public keys and does not divulge them to users, it is not possible to verify that a sent iMessage is going to the intended recipient. Apple could, for example, substitute or add a public key to intercept an outgoing message without the sender being aware of the change, as end users do not have access to public keys.\n\nWith a public server, such as MIT's PGP Public Key Server, the sender can at least see more information, such as whether a key has changed. At that point, the sender can decide whether they want to trust it or not if they suspect a man in the middle attack. Apple's key server is not public, the researchers say.\n\n\"The biggest problem here is you just cannot control that the public key you are using when you are ciphering the message is really the key of your recipient and not, for example, the public key of some guy in Apple,\" Cattiaux said.\n\nAccording to the researchers, there would be no way for an end user to detect an intercepted or rerouted message from their iOS device, as it is impossible to see whether or not a key has been switched or where a message has been routed. The solution to the issue, to introduce true end-to-end encryption, would require Apple to store public keys on each iOS device to allow users to compare keys to verify that messages are going to the intended recipient.\n\nEarlier this year, a Drug Enforcement Agency document noted that it was impossible for law enforcement agencies to eavesdrop directly on iMessage conversations due to Apple's encryption, but it appears that Apple itself could potentially intercept those messages using public keys.\n\nUpdate: Apple spokeswoman Trudy Muller said in a statement to AllThingsD that \"iMessage is not architected to allow Apple to read messages,\" adding that \"The research discussed theoretical vulnerabilities that would require Apple to re-engineer the iMessage system to exploit it, and Apple has no plans or intentions to do so.\"\n\nTop Rated Comments\n\nI've learned these days that anything and everything that has to do with information or data can be accessed by the authorities, illegal or not. We live in a surveillance state (in America). Notice how Yahoo and other service providers are pushing user \"profiles\" like Facebook, so they can make profiles on all of us. Next up is obviously fingerprint scanning. The conspiracy theorists weren't crazy after all.\n\nHow iMessage may work (at a high level, various optimizations exist to avoid overhead after initial key exchange, etc)... informs Sue of an message request and is handed Bob's public key.\n\nSue generates a private key and stores it securely on her device. Sue derives a public key from her private key. Sue gives her public key to Apple.\n\nApple informs Bob of Sue's public key.\n\nBob encrypts his message to Sue using Sue's public key. Bob gives his encrypted message to Apple asking for it to be delivered to Sue.\n\nApple informs Sue of Bob's message.\n\nSue decrypts the message from Bob using her private key.\n\nUnder this model only Bob and Sue have their private keys and hence only they can decrypt messages originating from their devices\n\n...HOWEVER, since Apple is the mediator of the public keys between Bob and Sue Apple could give Bob a public key of their own claiming it was from Sue. This would then allow Apple to decrypt messages from Bob heading to Sue. Apple can do the same thing with Sue. Then Apple would be able to get messages from Bob, decrypt them, look at the message, then re-encrypt it before passing it along to Sue. The man in the middle model... generates a private key and a FakeBob public key of their own. Apple informs Sue of an message request and is handed FakeBob's public key.\n\nSue generates a private key and stores it securely on her device. Sue derives a public key from her private key. Sue gives her public key to Apple.\n\nApple generates a private key and a FakeSue public key of their own. Apple informs Bob of FakeSue's public key.\n\nBob encrypts his message to Sue using FakeSue's public key. Bob gives his encrypted message to Apple asking for it to be delivered to Sue.\n\nApple decrypts message, looks at it, and then re-encrypts message using Sue's public key. Apple informs Sue of Bob's message.\n\nSue decrypts the message from Bob using her private key.\n\nPersonally I trust Apple to NOT do this and favor the simplicity of their method despite a man in the middle weakness internally in their system. They could prevent this but at the cost of trust being established between Bob and Sue in a more complex and cumbersome way... not ideal for typical users of iMessage.\n\n...personally not sure how this is news or a surprise, with the intentional simplicity and ease of use of the iMessage solution you have to assume Apple will be a good actor on your behalf...\n\nSo when iMessage texts go missing from time to time, or are delayed for no apparent reason, could this be a possible reason for it? (No, I don't think every time there's a missing or late message that this is the reason, but is it a possibility that when a message is delayed, it could be because it is being intercepted?)", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "d619114b-b7f6-447d-8273-d002ed9f47f4", "url": "https://www.macrumors.com/2013/10/17/researchers-claim-apple-can-potentially-access-encrypted-imessages/"}

{"text": "What is a Gold IRA and How Does it Work?\n\nBy\n/\n\nWhat is a gold IRA and how does it work?\n\nDisclaimer: We are supported by our readers. We may receive compensation from links on this page if you use products or services because of our expert recommendations. Please read our Advertising Disclosure.\n\nEvery investor wants to manage their risk and maximize their returns. To realize these goals, many people choose to invest their money in alternative assets, which include everything from gold to real estate. These investments can be made with a self-directed IRA.\n\nOver the past two decades, gold has become a popular retirement asset because of how it allows for better portfolio diversification. This guide goes into extensive detail about gold IRAs and the best companies to work with when creating one Is a Gold IRA?\n\nUnlike a traditional IRA, a gold IRA provides investors with the means of placing physical gold and other precious metals into their retirement accounts. The types of physical gold that an investor can add to their IRA include coins, bullion, and bars.\n\nIt's possible to invest in ETFs that track gold indexes, mutual funds of gold companies, and stocks of gold companies with a traditional IRA.\n\nThe other kinds of precious metals that can be placed in a gold IRA include platinum, silver, and palladium. According to the IRS, investors are only allowed to invest in one, one-tenth, one-quarter, and one-half-ounce versions of a U.S. gold coin. As for silver, the coins must be weighted at one ounce.\n\nGold IRA Account Types to Consider\n\nThere are numerous types of IRA accounts that an investor can choose to open, each of which offers unique benefits. The most common type of gold IRA is a traditional gold IRA.\n\nWhen an investor contributes funds to a traditional gold IRA, they can deduct the amount they invested from their income when filing taxes. When money is taken out of this account, taxes must be paid on the full amount.\n\nAnother type of gold IRA is a Roth gold IRA, which requires investors to pay taxes on the money before it's placed in the account. Once a contribution has been made, its value will increase on a tax-free basis.\n\nWhen a withdrawal occurs, investors don't pay any taxes on the money. There are also no restrictions on the amount of money that can be taken out of the account.\n\nInvestors may also choose to open a SEP gold IRA. These accounts are available for small businesses and self-employed individuals. They work just like traditional gold IRAs but provide people with the ability to make contributions to themselves and their employees.\n\nHow to Start a Gold IRA\n\nInvestors who wish to start a gold IRA must do so in a five-step process that begins by getting a custodian.\n\nGet a Custodian\n\nCustodians that can open a traditional IRA may be unable to open and manage a self-directed gold IRA, which is why it's important to find a custodian that can. Three of the most popular gold IRA custodians include Augusta Precious Metals, Goldco, and American Hartford Gold.\n\nThese companies guide investors through the process of opening a gold IRA account. However, numerous factors must be taken into account before choosing a gold IRA company to partner with, which include:\n\nTrack record and reputation\n\nFees\n\nTransparency\n\nCustomer support\n\nBuyback option\n\nPlace Funds in Gold IRA\n\nWhile gold and other precious metals can be placed in a gold IRA, the amount of contributions that are made to the account must adhere to IRS regulations. In 2023, the contribution limit is $6,500 for anyone younger than 50 and $7,500 for investors who are 50 or older.\n\nIt's also possible for investors to roll their traditional IRA or 401(k) into a gold IRA. Keep in mind that some guidelines apply when rolling funds into a gold IRA. If, for instance, pre-tax funds are distributed to a Roth IRA, they will be taxed before the rollover is completed.\n\nAfter-tax funds won't be taxed. If pre-tax funds are placed into a standard IRA, they aren't taxed immediately but will be when they are taken out of the account.\n\nPurchase Gold\n\nStringent rules are in place when it comes to buying physical gold for a gold IRA account. As an example, gold bars need to come with a 99.5% purity to be eligible for an IRA. The same purity is required when buying palladium and platinum. However, silver bars must have a 99.9% purity.\n\nAny proof coins that are added to a gold IRA need to be in fantastic condition. They're also required to come in original mint packaging. When investing in bullion coins, they need to be free of damage and in excellent condition.\n\nEven though the IRS allows Canadian Maple Leaf coins and American Gold Eagle coins, they don't allow British Sovereign coins or South African Krugerrand. Investors are also forbidden from placing gold collectibles in a gold IRA.\n\nIf an investor receives approval for their purchase, they're able to complete the transaction with the help of a broker.\n\nUse the Right Depository\n\nThe fourth step in this process involves the investor selecting the right depository to store their gold or other precious metals in. The IRS will need to approve a depository for this purpose. For gold to be placed in an IRA, it can't be shipped to the investor's home.\n\nThe IRS approves depositories like HSBC, the Delaware Depository Service Company, and JPMorgan Chase.\n\nEventually Withdraw Funds\n\nThe rules regarding fund withdrawals are also strict. If an investor doesn't follow these rules, they may need to pay withdrawal penalties. Keep in mind that a withdrawal involves selling gold for cash.\n\nThe purpose of an IRA is to save for retirement, which is why withdrawals are penalized if they are made before an investor reaches 59.5 years old. When investing in a traditional IRA, withdrawals that are made before retirement age come with a 10% penalty. After reaching retirement age, every withdrawal is taxed as income.\n\nA traditional gold IRA also has rules for required minimum distributions that apply to anyone older than 70.5. The minimum amount that must be withdrawn each year depends on how much savings are available. If money isn't taken out of the account every year, penalties could be assessed.\n\nFor people who use a Roth IRA account, assets that are placed in the IRA can be withdrawn at any time without incurring a penalty. If the assets grow in value over time, these earnings can only be withdrawn without penalties once the investor turns 59.5 years old.\n\nThere are a few exceptions to these rules, one of which is that penalty-free withdrawals can be taken early for:\n\nQualified educational expenses\n\nQualified medical expenses\n\nFirst-time home purchase\n\nAdvantages and Disadvantages of Gold IRA\n\nBefore opening a gold IRA, it's important to understand the pros and cons of this retirement account. The main benefit of a gold IRA is that it can be used as a hedge against current or future inflation. The value of gold can increase even when the economy is doing poorly.\n\nIt's also impossible for the value of gold to drop to zero, which isn't true with company stocks. While central banks can increase the supply of a currency to lower its value, making new gold is much more challenging.\n\nAnother benefit of opening a gold IRA is that gold isn't correlated with stocks and bonds. If the stock market performs poorly in a given month, the value of gold can increase during the same time.\n\nSince these assets aren't correlated, adding gold investments with stocks and bonds means that the level of risk in an investment portfolio should drop.\n\nKeep in mind, however, that there are a few drawbacks to opening a gold IRA. For one, the fees can be high when compared to a traditional IRA. Along with an initial account setup fee that's paid to a custodian, investors must also pay:\n\nAnnual account maintenance fees\n\nBrokerage fees\n\nSeller's fee\n\nStorage fees to the depository\n\nInsurance fees\n\nCash-out expenses\n\nA gold IRA is also illiquid in comparison to other types of investments. Selling physical silver or gold can be challenging unless the custodian company has a buyback program. Investors may need to sell at a price that's lower than the current market price.\n\nGold is somewhat volatile as well. If the value of gold or other precious metals drops significantly for a specific time, investors may experience substantial losses. Since gold is a physical asset, it can also be lost or stolen.\n\nWhile it's possible to insure against these losses, an insurance policy costs money.\n\nTop 3 Companies to Open a Gold IRA With\n\nEven though there aren't a large number of companies that offer gold IRAs, there are several fantastic options that every investor should consider. The top three companies to consider opening a gold IRA with include Augusta Precious Metals, Goldco, and American Hartford Gold.\n\nAugusta Precious Metals\n\nAugusta Precious Metals is an esteemed gold IRA company that has been in business since 2012. They offer reasonable pricing and a comprehensive catalog of silver, gold, and other precious metals that are available for purchase.\n\nAugusta Precious Metals has gained an A+ rating with the Better Business Bureau as well as an AAA rating with the Business Consumer Alliance, which shows how strong its reputation is.\n\nWhen an investor wants to open a gold IRA, they'll guide them through the process and provide them with extensive educational resources. Customers also receive a lifetime service guarantee.\n\nAugusta Precious Metals provides consistently great customer service. Whenever a customer has a question, they can call them on the phone, submit a question through their website, or select the live chat option to speak with a representative.\n\nThey continue helping customers even after the transaction has been completed. The main benefits of opening a gold IRA with Augusta Precious Metals include:\n\nPROS\n\nIt's easy to use their 401(k) rollover feature\n\nThere are no hidden costs\n\nThey offer a wide selection of precious metals\n\nTheir return policy is exceptional\n\nBullion, coins, and bars are available to buy and add to an investment portfolio\n\nAll customers receive lifetime support and service\n\nEvery silver and gold product is insured\n\nA few issues that should be kept in mind include:\n\nCONS\n\nA minimum investment of $50,000 is required\n\nPalladium and platinum metals aren't available for purchase\n\nTheir products can't be purchased online but must be bought at one of their physical branches\n\nGoldco is currently the most popular gold IRA company and has been in business since 2006. They specialize in gold and silver IRAs and aim to provide customers with knowledgeable support at all times. Once an IRA has been opened, it must be funded to finalize a purchase with Goldco. They accommodate 401(k) rollovers.\n\nWhen a customer has an issue with their purchase or needs to ask a question, they can reach a customer representative by clicking the online chat option that's found on the Goldco website.\n\nTheir live chat is available seven days per week. Informative videos and articles are available to investors who want to be certain that they're making a sound financial decision. The benefits of using Goldco include:\n\nPROS\n\nPricing is clear and easy to see\n\nLow fees and account protection charges\n\nA vast catalog of silver and gold products\n\nThe drawbacks to investing with Goldco include:\n\nCONS\n\nAmerican Hartford Gold is another well-known gold dealer that was founded in 2012 and is headquartered out of Los Angeles, CA. Investors who want to open a gold IRA have the option of buying gold and placing it in the IRA or performing a 401(k) rollover.\n\nThey provide customers with storage at third-party vaults from Delaware Depository Service and similar depositories.\n\nOver the years, American Hartford Gold has built customer trust by giving them the latest information on precious metals like gold and silver. They also offer 24/7 customer service that can be accessed by existing customers and potential customers alike.\n\nOne of the more notable features they offer is a buyback program that allows people to sell their precious metals back to American Hartford Gold. These purchases are made at current market prices.

{"text": "Life and career\n\nBorn in St. Paul, Minnesota, where his father was on the faculty (and later president) of Macalester College, he attended Mount Hermon School as a youth (now Northfield Mount Hermon School). Wallace attended college at Macalester from 1907 to 1909 and transferred to the University of California, Berkeley for two years. He returned to St. Paul in 1912 and was hired by a publishing firm specializing in farming literature.\n\nRoom 108 of the New York Public Library, now known as the DeWitt Wallace Periodical Room, services current unbound issues of 68 popular periodical titles and 22 domestic and foreign newspapers. In the 1920s DeWitt Wallace spent countless hours in this room, reading and condensing articles from the Library's collection. In 1983, the room's restoration was made possible by a gift from the Wallace Fund, established by DeWitt Wallace.\n\nDuring World War I, Wallace enlisted in the U.S. Army and was wounded. He spent four months in a French hospital recovering from his injuries, passing the time by reading American magazines.\n\nReturning to the U.S., Wallace spent every day of the next six months at the Minneapolis Public Library researching and condensing magazine articles. He wanted to create a magazine with articles on a wide variety of subjects, abridged so that each could be easily read. Wallace showed his sample magazine to Lila Bell Acheson, sister of an old college friend, who responded enthusiastically. He proposed to her and on October 15, 1921, they were married.\n\nThe Wallaces decided to publish the magazine themselves and market it by direct mail. The first issue appeared on February 5, 1922. Reader's Digest soon became one of the most widely circulated periodicals in the world. Wallace was a supporter of the Republican Party with strong anti-communist views, and the magazine reflected these beliefs. Wallace and his wife were strong supporters of Richard Nixon's presidential bid in 1968, giving Nixon cash donations and allowing Nixon to write articles for the Digest.\n\nWallace was a noted philanthropist, donating much of his massive fortune to his alma mater Macalester College. The Wallaces also established a number of foundations that are now consolidated as The Wallace Foundation, which supports education, youth development and the arts. There is a dormitory with his name on the Northfield Mount Hermon campus. He funded the DeWitt Wallace Decorative Arts Museum, opened in 1985 at Colonial Williamsburg, Virginia.\n\nContent is available under CC BY-SA 3.0 unless otherwise noted.\nKiddle encyclopedia articles are based on selected content and facts from Wikipedia, edited or rewritten for children.\nPowered by MediaWiki.", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "12240884-b2c4-4931-ba29-d8438691fcc3", "url": "https://kids.kiddle.co/DeWitt_Wallace"}

{"text": "Fibonacci Day: How To Use Math To Trade Bitcoin And Altcoins\n\nBitcoin price broke above its 2019 high, and after that, took off another $5,000. The reason why the level was so critical to confirming a reversal back into a bull market, was due to the resistance residing at the golden ratio – based on the Fibonacci sequence.\n\nToday, to celebrate both Fibonacci Day and Bitcoin's breakout beyond the key zone, we're taking a deep look at the importance of Fibonacci retracement levels in financial markets like cryptocurrencies.\n\nWhat Is Fibonacci Sequence And Why How Does It Apply To BTCUSD Technical Analysis?\n\nAlthough Bitcoin is an asset unlike any other before it, it still tends to follow the same laws and dynamics that govern financial markets. The cryptocurrency goes through market cycles where sentiment shifts from bullish to bearish and back, and responds the same to support and resistance as forex, stocks, commodities, and more.\n\nThe entire Bitcoin code is built on mathematical code, and everything down to the number of BTC and the block reward halving mechanism relies heavily on math.\n\nIt is only fitting then, that Bitcoin and other crypto assets built on math, respond so well to mathematical levels of support and resistance.\n\nThese mathematical levels tend to reside at ratios based on the Fibonacci sequence, in which the sum of the previous two numbers makes up the current number and so forth indefinitely.\n\nOn November 23rd the world celebrates the famous Italian mathematician that first made sense out of the numbers found everywhere in nature.\n\nLeonardo Bonacci of Pisa was the author of Liber Abaci, also known as The Book of Calculation. Using the sequence, he could with a degree of accuracy predict the future population of rabbits. The numbers have since been used to predict all sorts of outcomes, and its ratios – specifically the golden ratio or divine proportion is of specific importance.\n\nBitcoin's 2019 rally stopped at the 0.618 level, breaking through it caused the current rally | Source: BTCUSD on TradingView.com\n\nHow Bitcoin And Altcoins React To Fibonacci Retracement Levels\n\nIn the chart above, Bitcoin's 2019 high was the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement level – the golden ratio. Getting back above it, signaled to the market that a reversal was taking place.\n\nHolding there last year, kept the cryptocurrency in the troughs of bear territory. The chart above also demonstrates on the way down from Bitcoin's all-time high, each corresponding bear market peak, almost perfectly stopped at each subsequently lower Fibonacci retracement level.\n\nEach level also runs directly through some of the asset's most critical support and resistance zones, but why? It isn't clear why markets behave in such a way, but 0.618 often acts as the most important resistance or support level in any asset – not just Bitcoin.\n\nFibonacci extensions, such as the 1.618, could act as resistance after a new all-time high is set. And with the golden ratio acting as an ideal place to buy support or sell resistance, 0.618 could be a logical place for any correction to fall to.\n\nIf Bitcoin has put in a short term top and corrects from the current prices, the 0.618 level could be the primary target. The cryptocurrency could find support at any of the Fib levels above there, but in past bull markets, it was right on the money", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "b583d6f4-cb3d-4a34-9dac-e9457fad5b86", "url": "https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/btc/fibonacci-day-how-to-use-math-to-trade-bitcoin-and-altcoins/"}

Dilated attention's ability to increase the model's awareness of distant tokens sets it apart from conventional models and makes billion-token Transformers a reality.\n\nKey Advantages of LongNet\n\nLongNet brings a host of benefits to the table. For starters, it demonstrates a linear computational complexity, a remarkable feat considering the scale it operates at. The model also showcases a logarithmic dependency between tokens, significantly reducing the computational burden.\n\nLongNet can be employed as a distributed trainer for extremely long sequences, opening up new avenues in the realm of deep learning. What's more, the model's dilated attention serves as a drop-in replacement for standard attention and can be seamlessly integrated with existing Transformer-based optimizations.\n\nPerformance Metrics and Potential Applications\n\nLongNet's experimental results reveal its exceptional capability, yielding strong performance in both long-sequence modeling and general language tasks. The model's versatility coupled with its robust scalability makes it a promising tool for handling extensive sequences.\n\nWith LongNet, it's possible to consider a whole corpus or even the entire Internet as a sequence. Imagine the potential: from profound text analytics on entire libraries of books to comprehensive web analysis for understanding global trends. The possibilities are truly endless.\n\nConclusion\n\nLongNet signals a paradigm shift in the world of large language models. By scaling Transformers to 1 billion tokens, it offers unparalleled potential in processing and understanding extensive sequences. As we move forward, the introduction of LongNet will not just open up new possibilities, but could very well set a new standard in the field. The world stands on the brink of a revolutionary change in sequence modeling - and LongNet is leading the charge.", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "fc6463de-ba07-4fcd-b31c-6aad7dc94c6a", "url": "https://www.explainx.ai/post/longnet-pioneering-the-future-of-ai-with-a-leap-to-1-billion-token-transformers"}

See how your hearts beats when you think about something you are afraid of doing yet want to do with your whole heart? While we cannot totally rid ourselves of the emotion of fear, we can interrogate the root cause of our fear. What triggers the emotion of fear within us ? How do we react and act to the emotion of fear?\n\nIf there is one thing you have to take note of in your life about yourself is that there is positive and negative side to yourself. There is a receptive and deceptive side to yourself. Thinking negative thoughts is as good as thinking negative thoughts. The emotion of fear is normal and you cannot do away with it. You can release and let go the fear and not allow it to hold you back. You can engage with the emotion and see what it has to offer. There is always something to learn. Even with the fear that you hold within, you can learn about yourself through interrogating the triggers. If your fear is based on what is external to you ask yourself why that has so much control of your internality.\n\nJournal Journey Exercise: take a closer look at the lovers card. Both the male and the female represents you. It represents your feminine and masculine energy, you Ying and Yang, your Positive and Negative. Your low and high vibration. Locate your fear in the card, name your fear, note down what triggers your fear, note that how you will work with your fear for optimum results in your", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "2ce3e733-498f-494d-a528-a39b5e648416", "url": "https://deepstash.com/article/66352/this-life-is-yours"}
{"text": "Posts\n\nAmazing things happened on Sunday mornings at Serenity Village and Rehabilitation Center.1 Nearly everyone on the memory care unit had some form of dementia, including Alzheimer's disease. As chaplain intern, I was responsible for assisting with the weekly worship services. It didn't take me long to realize that the outward listlessness of some of the residents did not necessarily match what they were thinking and feeling inside.\n\nI became acutely aware of this one Sunday morning during worship. The liturgical team had just read the scripture and prayed. Then we began to sing a hymn. One of the residents, who I initially thought was sleeping, began to smile. I knew then that he had been able to make a connection with what was being said and done during the service. Although this resident was not able to vocalize lyrics, he derived some pleasure from the music.\n\nThe deeper I delved into the matter, the more I became aware that spirituality, faith, and religious rituals seemed to be necessary for the overall well being of the Alzheimer's patients at Serenity. Based on some research I had read, I believed that music tended to calm them down, alleviate their depression, and stimulate recollection of past events. I was also convinced that music therapy could reduce wandering and restlessness and increase chemicals in the brain that promoted sleep and eased anxiety.\n\nNot only that; I noticed that music tended to awaken long dormant, but deeply embedded, memories. On another day when I was in the break room sitting with several residents who were listening to old hymns on the intercom, many of them appeared to be relishing the songs they heard. As I saw their faces light up, I asked, \"Do you know this song?\" In response, residents who hadn't said a word in weeks responded haltingly with their recollections. They called up their stories in detail replete with descriptions of people, places, and circumstances, depending on their ability to express themselves verbally.\n\nTo my surprise, Mr. Crenshaw's feet began to keep time with the rhythm. The heads of the other three residents who shared the table with us also began to bounce to the beat. Smiles brightened faces, and mouths flashed yellowing teeth as the mood changed in the common area. Different musical selections were played throughout the morning while CNAs went about the task of caring for those who had only these familiar songs to awaken memories that had been dormant for too long.", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "d5080c96-f0e8-41f7-9122-5d714e81303f", "url": "https://rivertreechristianchapel.org/page/13/"}

{"text": "Abstract:GRB satellites are relatively inefficient detectors of dim hard bursts because they trigger on photon counts, which are number-biased against hard photons. Therefore, for example, given two bursts of identical peak luminosity near the detection threshold, a dim soft burst will be preferentially detected over a dim hard burst. This detector bias can create or skew an apparent correlation where increasingly hard GRBs appear increasingly bright. Although such correlations may be obfuscated by a middle step where GRBs need to be bright enough to have their actual redshifts determined, it is found that the bias is generally pervasive. This result is derived here through simulations convolving a wide variety of possible GRB brightnesses and spectra with the BATSE Large Area Detectors (LAD) detection thresholds. The presented analyses indicate that the rest-frame $\\nu F_{\\nu}$ spectrum peak energy of long-duration GRBs, $\\epi$, is not a good cosmological standard candle without significant corrections for selection effects. Therefore, the appearance of $\\epi$ in seeming correlations such as the Amati ($E_{iso}-\\epi$), Ghirlanda ($E_{\\gamma}-\\epi$), and $L_{iso}-\\epi$ relations is statistically real but strongly influenced by so far uncalibrated GRB detector thresholds.\n\nComments:\n\nNov-03-2011: Minor correction to the horizontal axis in the plot of Figure 3.

{"text": "In the shifting landscape that is the workplace, 'non-productive time' poses a challenge for many.\n\nThe term has been coined as such to highlight existing restrictions imposed upon employees in how to use their time at work. We must adapt and embrace a broader, more qualitative approach to work, emphasizing the value of seemingly non-productive output alongside productive ones.\n\nWe need to expand our methods of productivity measurement to include non-traditional activities and translate these into measurable results.\n\nRecently, Gensler conducted workplace surveys that have provided valuable insights into the shifting work dynamics. Individuals are proactively investing in their professional growth, compensating for the lack of face-to-face input and support from superiors.\n\nThe offices of the future are set to prioritize collaboration, emphasizing social spaces, outdoor accessibility, and various amenities that promote employee interactions. These elements are intangible when it comes to measuring productivity.\n\nThe emphasis must lie not merely on increased learning or socializing demands, but rather on employees being purposeful in allocating time for personal development and social interactions. However, when employers prioritize every moment for productivity, these essential yet intangible needs can suffer, ultimately resulting in decreased measurable results.\n\nProductivity vs non-productivity\n\nMcKinsey's 2023 report, 'Rekindling US Productivity for a New Era', offers a clear definition of productivity: \"Productivity is the quantifiable measure of goods and services produced in relation to the labor, capital, and resources invested in their creation\".\n\nIt encompasses all measurable work directly linked to business outcomes, be it the precision of a delivery driver's timing or a CEO's proficiency in generating profits. However, often overlooked are the qualitative factors that contribute to well-being, social connections, culture, and emotional safety.\n\nProductivity is no longer a simple on-off binary code. To adapt to our new reality, we must design workplaces that recognize productivity and non-productivity aspects, acknowledging the significance of a balanced approach.\n\nDesigning for non-productivity\n\nThe future workplace must transcend traditional designs like open-work plans, activity-based layouts, and productivity-focused tools. Instead, it should actively support non-productivity opportunities.\n\nThis evolution goes beyond mere entertainment gimmicks; it involves creating meaningful programs and spaces that foster growth and experiences among colleagues. A workspace that acknowledges the importance of non-productive elements is primed to become a true catalyst for success in the changing world of work.\n\nInnovation and evolution\n\nThe creative process flourishes when given the freedom to explore without measurement constraints. While productivity may be the ultimate goal, the birth of fresh ideas occurs beyond the realm of measurement.\n\nDesignated spaces that encourage experimentation with unquantifiable outcomes - such as maker spaces and creative writing rooms - hold immense potential in nurturing innovation. By embracing non-productivity, we pave the way for groundbreaking ideas that push boundaries and drive progress.\n\nPrioritizing well-being\n\nEssential activities that contribute to our overall well-being - self-reflection, mental and physical health, and building resilience to tackle challenges - are often labeled as non-productive. Regrettably, under the weight of work demands, taking time for our well-being is relegated to after-hours pursuits.\n\nWorkplaces can integrate dedicated spaces like yoga rooms and parks, providing opportunities for individuals to find solace and rejuvenation throughout the workday. By redefining productivity to encompass well-being, we pave the way for a healthier and more sustainable approach to work.\n\nPower of relationships\n\nIn pursuing personal growth, learning and fostering strong relationships with colleagues play a pivotal role. Through this enriching process, we gain fresh perspectives and cultivate innovative ways of thinking.\n\nEqually significant is the network of supportive peers and advocates we build, offering constructive feedback and informal recognition that keep us engaged and connected.\n\nUltimately, the company culture will need to adapt to fully embrace all elements outside of quantifiable productivity and allow employees to feel safe in their non-productive nature. Only then will employees be able to experience the full alignment of a company's mission, vision, and purpose through spaces that allow them to contribute more fully and to be their whole selves", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "bb556369-f31b-45ac-8953-cff8577dbf35", "url": "https://gulfnews.com/business/analysis/even-non-productive-work-elements-need-space-in-offices-of-tomorrow-1.1691999326033"}

The late Mr. Odin Rohidin started this artistic activity in the 1970s. Aside from paintings, Jelekong Village is also active in such activities as Pencak Silat, Wayang Golek, and the Jaipong dance. Unfortunately, this village has a hard time developing in terms of facilities and infrastructures, which is caused by lack of attention from the local government. This results in the fact that not many people, even those in Bandung know the whereabouts of the artisans in Jelekong Village, who in fact play an important role in preserving the traditional Sundanese arts and culture. That is why, there is a need to design a media that is able to document and narrate the things that these artisans do in Jelekong Village and their daily struggles in creating art without being acknowledged and appreciated by their own people. By designing a documentary photography book, it is expected that the people of Bandung will be more informed about these artisans and will support the making of better facilities and infrastructures to rise up their spirit in creating more arts.", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "718d7df1-2f4c-49bf-8fd1-a83e7cd8455a", "url": "https://journal.maranatha.edu/index.php/srjd/article/view/811"}
{"text": "When the angel of the Lord appeared to Gideon, he said, \"The Lord is with you, mighty warrior.\" Judges 6:12\n\nEighteen-year-old Emma faithfully talks about Jesus on social media, even though bullies have criticized her joy and enthusiastic love for Christ. Some have attacked her with remarks about her physical appearance. Others have suggested a lack of intelligence because of her devotion to God. Though the unkind words cut deep into Emma's heart, she continues to spread the gospel with bold faith and love for Jesus and others. Sometimes, though, she's tempted to believe her identity and worth are determined by the criticism of others. When that happens, she asks God for help, prays for her persecutors, meditates on the words of Scripture, and perseveres with Spirit-empowered courage and confidence.\n\nGideon faced fierce tormentors—the Midianites (Judges 6:1–10). Though God called him a \"mighty warrior,\" Gideon struggled to let go of his doubt, self-imposed limitations, and insecurities (vv. 11–15). On more than one occasion, he questioned the Lord's presence and his own qualifications, but eventually surrendered in faith.\n\nWhen we trust God, we can live like we believe what He says about us is true.

{"text": "Pages\n\nFriday, June 21, 2019\n\nWhat are the 'Works of God' in John 9?\n\nIn the story of the man born blind in John 9, the disciples asked Jesus whether he had sinned or his parents to cause him to be born blind. If you ask the average evangelical Christian to read the first few verses of John 9 and then ask them the question, \"Why was the man born blind?,\" in many, if not most, cases they will respond, \"For God's glory.\" Indeed, if you had asked, \"According to this passage of Scripture, why was this man born blind?\" they would have the same answer.\n\nNow I have no doubt God's glory is involved in the lives of those afflicted with various things, and in the life of this man born blind. However, the words \"God's glory\" (or any directly relevant variant) just isn't in the text. In fact, John 9:3 states in part, \"that the works of God should be made manifest in him,\" (KJV) \"that the works of God might be displayed in him\" (NIV, ESV, NASB).\n\nSo a relevant question for understanding what's going on in this text is \"what are the works of God in the book of John?\" I will suggest the works of God, for John, can be found in the theme of John and in a passage (really, more than one) of John. The theme of the Gospel of John is \"believe.\" John basically tells us this near the very end of his work, when he says he has written these things so that his audience might believe on the name of Jesus (a theme he repeats in his epistles, specifically 1 John). With this in mind, check out John 6:28-29: \"… 'What shall we do, so that we may work the works of God?' Jesus answered and said to them, 'This is the work of God, that you believe in Him whom He has sent.'\"\n\nThese are obviously non-meritorious works (that is, it's not a belief that earns you salvation), but rather the belief (faith and trust) in the Son of God for eternal life. Following Christ is what John is all about. So what are the works of God in John 9 that this blind man was meant to display? Faith in Jesus Christ, the Lord, the Savior, the Son of God and God the Son (see John 9:38 for the resolution).\n\nWhat difference does it make? The main difference is one's theology of suffering. While belief in Jesus obviously redounds to God's glory, if you think God has people endure pain and suffering merely for his glory, God simply uses people to attain ends. This devalues God's creation and, ironically, God himself. Instead, we ought to recognize God does things for his glory, and for our good—and not just instrumentally. Jesus' purpose in this story is to show his mission—to seek and save that which was lost.", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "2d80becc-8703-45c1-b5bc-fc1d28dbc132", "url": "https://www.randyeverist.com/2019/06/what-are-works-of-god-in-john-9.html"}
{"text": "Proven Strategies To Get More Social Media Clients for Your Agency\n\nUnless you've been living under a giant rock while wearing noise-canceling headphones, you know that social media marketing is essentially table stakes for any business. And capitalizing on that need is a great way for agencies to land high-quality clients for their social media services.\n\nStep 1: Clearly Define Your Ideal Client Profile (ICP)\n\nWhat type of client does your agency serve? Do you have an established industry niche? Do you typically work with small local businesses or global enterprises? Are there certain social media platforms that your agency has specific expertise in?\n\nDefining your ideal client helps you clarify the desired end result (landing a specific type of client) and work backward to determine your strategy for connecting with them. Keep the process simple and organized by using a template like the one below.\n\nNo consistent presence on the top social media channels (i.e. Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn)\n\nHaven't posted on their social media channels in months\n\nCross-posting the exact same content on multiple channels\n\nLow engagement on social media posts, especially if they have a large number of followers\n\nGeneric social media graphics you recognize as stock photography or basic templates\n\nInconsistent brand colors or graphic styles\n\nLess active than competitors on social media\n\nA social presence that seems very off-brand\n\nDownload our free client profile template\n\nUse this template to build your ideal client profile\n\nStep 2: Research Where Your Target Audience Is Most Active on Social Media\n\nIt's easy to waste a lot of time and resources targeting clients using the wrong channels. Different industries favor certain platforms. If your ICP is local home service providers, chances are you'll have better luck connecting with them on Facebook than TikTok. If your ICP is luxury hotel brands, you might determine that Instagram is where they spend most of their time. And B2B clients will likely gravitate towards LinkedIn.\n\nKnowing where your ICP is most active on social media will inform your agency's social media strategy to catch their attention and tell you which services to pitch once you've got it. If you know your ICP is most active on a certain platform, your agency should consider paid ads and brand awareness campaigns on that platform to increase your chances of gaining inbound leads.\n\nAccording to our 2023 Agency Benchmarks Report, the majority of agencies currently identify Facebook (28%) and Instagram (23%) as the most promising social media platforms, with TikTok (18%) and YouTube (15%) coming in third and fourth.\n\nStep 3: Get Clear on Your Agency's Goals and Client Acquisition KPIs\n\nWhenever you're preparing to spend time and effort on lead generation for your agency, it's crucial that you define exactly what your goals are and what KPIs you'll use to measure success.\n\nHere are some questions to ask:\n\nHow many new customers are you trying to attract?\n\nHow many leads does your agency need to close enough deals?\n\nWithin what timeframe do you want to attract them?\n\nWhat defines a high-quality lead or quality client for your agency? How will you assess this?\n\nWhat kind of conversion funnel will you use (if any)?\n\nAre there channel-specific metrics you need to measure?\n\nHow will you measure your return on investment (ROI)?\n\nHow will you measure your lead generation efforts on an ongoing basis?\n\nThis will help you not only maximize your chances of success but also keep you accountable for what strategies and tactics are not working so you know when to pivot.\n\nStep 4: Polish Your Agency's Social Media Presence\n\nLet's face it, if your agency has a lackluster social media presence, it doesn't do anyone any favors (especially not your potential clients.)\n\nOne of the most effective strategies when it comes to finding clients for your social media marketing agency is to use your social media presence to clearly showcase the specific expertise you provide for your clients. Your social media channels are likely one of the first things potential clients will check before deciding to work with you.\n\nThink of this as a \"drink your own champagne\" moment.\n\nIf your agency's social media game looks like it's stuck in the MySpace era, it's like a baker offering free samples of burnt cookies. So, while you're churning out award-worthy campaigns for clients, don't forget to create social profiles your agency is proud of so that they become part of your agency's online portfolio.\n\nPro Tip: Use your agency's client testimonials and success stories as content. Did you just increase a client's reach by 30%? Talk about it on your platforms. Manage to trend a hashtag? Flaunt it. These instances not only create excellent content but also serve as testimonials of your prowess.\n\nWhen you're trying to acquire social media clients, your agency's social media shouldn't just exist; it should thrive. To ensure your social media presence is robust enough to attract new business, start with the following strategies:\n\nCompany Page: Start with a well-crafted company page on platforms like LinkedIn and Facebook. Ensure your branding is consistent and your services are clearly outlined. This sets the stage for anyone looking to find clients or understand your offerings.\n\nProof of Expertise: Provide tangible proof that goes beyond mere claims of expertise, making you a more attractive choice for potential clients.\n\nCommunity Engagement: Regularly interact with your audience by responding to comments and sharing relevant industry content. Active engagement expands your network and opens up new opportunities to find clients.\n\nEvents: Share highlights and key learnings from leading industry events on your social media platforms, tagging other attendees or businesses to increase visibility.\n\nWe have a private Facebook group where we offer a specific monthly Webinar to help train our auto repair shop clients. We keep track of who attends, if anyone has questions, and it's a good way to gauge our client's happiness.\n\nStrategies To Get Social Media Clients\n\nNow that your agency has prepared to welcome more social media clients to your roster, you can begin to examine the strategies that will work best to generate qualified leads. Let's take a look at some of the most powerful strategies.\n\nWork Your Immediate Network\n\nBefore you invest time in finding shiny new clients on social media, leverage your existing network. This could be word-of-mouth recommendations or putting together a formal referral program for your most satisfied clients.\n\nAnother reliable option to find potential clients for your social media marketing services is to connect with your local community through networking events. You may be able to find complementary businesses that can refer you to new clients for your social media agency.\n\nIt's about putting in the work and planting seeds. I was never thinking about building a referral network or making connections for the sake of leverage. Instead, I genuinely just cared about my clients, my coworkers, and the work I was doing. Excellence mattered to me. Respect mattered to me. 90% of our book of business has come through friends, family, and referrals. And I owe much of my success today to this fact.\n\nHigh-Quality Content Marketing\n\nYour expertise in social media can also be a content goldmine. Develop original, data-driven content that addresses common pain points in your target industry. Instead of merely stating that a good social media strategy is essential, offer actionable insights or case studies on how a proper strategy can impact a business. Distribute this content through your own social channels, industry forums, and email newsletters.\n\nIf you can solve a potential client's basic problems with free content, they are more likely to turn to you to help them solve the more complex problems.\n\nWe've always been really big on giving as much information as people have an appetite for. And we're not worried about giving away trade secrets because knowing something and executing it is a totally different story.\n\nIt may be tempting to cast a wide net in hopes of landing more social media clients, but this often brings in wrong-fit clients and dilutes your agency's brand. When you go after a specific segment of the market, it's much easier toposition your agency as the obvious choice for that group.\n\nConsider these questions:\n\nWhat are the specific outcomes we've achieved for our existing clients? Focus on your best clients because, ultimately, those are the types of clients you want more of.\n\nWhat specific expertise do we have? Does your team make awesome video content? Focusing on platforms like TikTok and Instagram might be a great way to niche down.\n\nWhat industries do you know inside and out? If there are unique characteristics or challenges that your agency has expertise and experience in, capitalize on that.\n\nInitially focusing on a narrow target market doesn't limit your agency forever. It's a starting point that lets you build expertise and reputation. Done right, this specific focus becomes a magnet for clients, reducing the need for aggressive outreach. You can always pivot or expand into other areas once you've established a strong foundation.\n\nThe choice to become a specialist really came about over a few years where we'd seen success working in the niche, and then grown into more authority in the space after landing some big brands and authority partners as clients. We felt the universe was telling us something, so we leaned into our niche from that point!\n\nEngage With Your Audience On Social Media\n\nTo truly grow a magnetic social media presence for your agency, you can't just have a one-way conversation with your audience. You need to engage them in a friendly and personable way to build relationships and show you're not just there to make sales for your agency.\n\nA motto we use on social media is, 'You either want to work with us or for us.' So, everything we put out on social media should make people think, 'Oh, that's a company I want to work at,' and it equally should attract prospective clients.\n\nTag and Engage With Other Accounts To Increase Visibility: As you post content on social media to attract clients, tag relevant accounts in your posts to extend your reach and engage with larger audiences.\n\nRun Contests: Contests are an excellent way to increase your agency's visibility and grow your social media following.\n\nPosition Your Social Media Agency as an Authority\n\nBeing featured on well-known platforms that aren't your own serves as social proof of your agency's expertise. When your audience sees that you're contributing to respected websites, white papers, or platforms, it reinforces their perception of your agency as a trusted source.\n\nGuest posting also often leads to noteworthy media mentions, which can further cement you as an authority in your space and improve your agency's website's search engine optimization via backlinks.\n\nForm Strategic Partnerships\n\nForming partnerships with non-competing agencies offers a win-win situation. For instance, a web design and development firm could refer clients to you for social media services, and you do the same for them when your clients need new landing pages.\n\nWith strategic partnerships, you can focus on your core specialties while still giving clients a holistic approach to their marketing efforts - which makes your job easier and the client happier.\n\nLinkedIn Prospecting\n\nLinkedIn isn't just for job seekers. The platform is a hotbed for B2B networking. The trick here isn't to spam inboxes with cold pitches but to build genuine relationships. Start conversations by commenting meaningfully on your prospects' posts or articles. Once a rapport is established, present tailored solutions based on the knowledge you've gained about the client during those early communications.\n\nTell a story. Everyone loves a good story. Center your client as the hero by understanding how they can overcome the issues in their business with your service.\n\nRemember, people don't like being sold to; they like solving their problems.\n\nPaid Advertising for Precision Targeting\n\nPaid search and social media ads offer granular targeting options that can be tailored to suit your ideal client profile. The key is in fine-tuning targeting options based on the audiences and keywords that perform best, crafting an offer that's too good to pass up, and then directing those who click to a landing page that converts.\n\nMake sure to A/B test different elements of your campaigns to hone in on what resonates most with your audience.\n\nEnhance this strategy by implementing retargeting ads aimed at potential clients who have visited specific pages on your agency's website, making your marketing efforts more cohesive and effective.\n\nOffer Free Workshops or Webinars\n\nGive away a slice to sell the pie. Offering free workshops or webinars on a topic where you have authority and expertise serves as a powerful lead magnet. The critical factor here is value; attendees should walk away feeling they've gained something worthwhile, not just an elongated sales pitch.\n\nWe share knowledge freely and often with blogs, courses, resources, podcast appearances, guest lecturing, public speaking, etc., so people can see a glimpse of the real expertise we have.\n\nThat creates goodwill and positions you as a go-to expert, making the transition to a sales discussion more natural.\n\nThe Fine Art of Follow-Up\n\nAfter initial contact or a sales pitch, the ball is often left hanging. Don't underestimate the power of a well-timed follow-up. It not only shows your keen interest but also offers an opportunity for feedback, which is vital for growth and improvement.\n\nKeep the communication channel open and make sure you stay on the prospect's radar. It's easy for your proposal to get buried under the day-to-day clutter; your follow-up acts as a nudge, reminding them of the opportunity at hand.\n\nIt's also important to demonstrate your genuine interest in their business needs, not just in making a sale. This cultivates a sense of trust and partnership, factors that many clients weigh heavily when choosing an agency.\n\nUse your follow-up as a platform for gathering invaluable feedback. Whether or not the prospect chooses to go ahead with your services, understanding their sales objections and documenting the questions they ask are critical data points that can refine future sales strategies and service offerings.\n\nSo, think of the follow-up as a strategic activity, not a pesky chore–one that keeps the conversation going, fosters trust, and provides a loop for continuous improvement.\n\nLeverage Analytics To Maximize ROI\n\nIn order to find out what activities and campaigns are driving the highest ROI for your agency, you'll need to track your own agency's campaign performance.\n\nFor example, when tracking your social media marketing campaigns, make sure to be clear on the specific goal you're trying to reach. Here are various goals you might consider when using social media to attract potential clients:\n\nIncrease brand awareness\n\nManage brand reputation\n\nIncrease traffic to your website\n\nGenerate leads\n\nBoost conversions or sales\n\nGain insights using social listening\n\nMost social media platforms have their own internal analytics you can look at, but it can be time-consuming to analyze data from multiple sources. What you really need is a way to pull data from your multiple social media channels into one place.AgencyAnalytics helps you do just that, creating custom dashboards in minutes flat with our drag-and-drop report builder.\n\nLanding New Clients Is Just the Beginning\n\nFinding clients isn't just about knocking on doors and shaking hands anymore. It's not just about the killer Facebook ads that your team is already cooking up for your clients. Once those clients sign on the dotted line, it's all about proving that they made the right choice. This is when transparency and data claim their place at the table, and it's your turn to serve them right.\n\nEvery business owner, freelance social media manager, or prospective client wants proof of success. Words and charming PowerPoint slides might get you in the door, but data kicks it wide open.\n\nAgencyAnalytics empowers your agency to create customized dashboards that not only display metrics like engagement, reach, and ROI, but also look so clean and professional they practically tie a bow around your skills and capabilities.\n\nWant to seal the deal? Offer potential clients a sneak peek of these dashboards. Imagine being able to present numbers in a visual format that doesn't induce eye-rolls or yawns.\n\nShow a new client an example report when you onboard them. This will ensure they know exactly what they will be receiving when it comes to reporting.\n\nSharing metrics and performance with our clients is one of the key things that helps us gain their trust. We use AgencyAnalytics early on when pitching our services to a client to show them this handy reporting tool they'll get when they work with us.\n\nBy providing a snapshot of the type of reporting they can expect, you're essentially handing them a magnifying glass to inspect your agency's craftsmanship up close. Data, meet deal. Deal, meet handshake.\n\nIn a world obsessed with results, AgencyAnalytics puts your agency on the map. And hey, isn't that where you've always wanted to be?\n\nWritten by\n\nLena Sesardic", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "4bd335af-271a-4c60-a504-d85ce7fd1979", "url": "https://agencyanalytics.com/blog/get-social-media-clients"}

{"text": "How cloud native workloads affect cardinality over time\n\nHow cloud native workloads affect cardinality over time\n\nWhen it comes to metrics, cardinality is an important topic. For those who are not familiar, cardinality in metrics refers to the number of possible time-series there can be, based on the dimensions the metrics have, and dimensions are the different properties of your data. Chronopsphere has written several articles on our blog related to high cardinality, understanding the cardinality in your workload, managing cardinality spikes, and more.\n\nOne thing that has not been covered well when it comes to cardinality is how important it is to understand cardinality over time. It's quite common to see workloads that have perfectly manageable cardinality when looking at a point in time, but if you try to query metrics over a longer window, the performance is unacceptable, to the point where the underlying system may not even be able to handle requests for data. In this post, we'll discuss how to think about cardinality over time, introduce the concept of \"churn\" in a workload and consider how the ephemerality of cloud native workloads can affect long-term cardinality.\n\nHow to think about cardinality over time\n\nFirst things first: How is cardinality over time different from cardinality at a given moment? It turns out that this is fairly straightforward. As we've noted before, cardinality is the number of possible groupings there are for the metrics we have. So, if we want to understand the cardinality at a given time, we just need to count how many time series there are. If you're using Prometheus, we can calculate the cardinality of our workload at a given point in time using the expression `sum(scrape_samples_scraped{})`, which will tell us how many unique time series are being ingested across all of our scrape jobs.\n\nAn example of summarizing cardinality broken down by job via the `scrape_samples_scraped` metric. This shows us the number of series being scraped by Prometheus for each job, at a given point in time.\n\nHow do things change when we're looking at a window of time though? Well, we need to understand how many unique time series there are throughout the entire window. For example, let's say we are measuring CPU usage across all of the containers for a particular service over the past hour. If you deployed a new version halfway through the hour, then to get a complete view of the hour, we'd need to fetch the series for the CPU running the old version of the service, as well as the series measuring CPU for the new version. Another way to say this: If we are looking at a window of time and a time series stops reporting within that window, the cardinality in that window of time does not change, because we still saw the time series within the time window. What this means is that as our window of time gets larger, the cardinality of our data will only ever increase. The consequence is that the longer window of time we want to query and visualize metrics across, the more expensive it can potentially become. Suppose you are using Prometheus and want to understand the cardinality of your workload over a window of time. In that case, you can monitor the `prometheus_tsdb_head_series` metric, which will track the number of unique series in the head block for the time-series database (a two-hour window by default.\n\nUnderstanding 'churn' in workloads\n\nBecause cardinality increases over longer windows of time, it's important to keep track of both the point-in-time cardinality of our workloads as well as the rate that it is increasing as we look back over the history of our metrics. We commonly refer to the rate of change in cardinality over time as the \"churn\" of our workload — that is, how quickly new series are introduced into our workload. A workload with low point-in-time cardinality but high churn will tend to suffer from poor query performance the farther back in time users try to query, even more so than a workload that has high point-in-time cardinality, but low churn.\n\nSome real-world examples of churn\n\nSo what kinds of workloads can have high churn? In truth, a number of things can produce churn, so most workloads will have some degree of churn. For example, every time you deploy a new version of a service, you will probably introduce new time series — and thus churn — into your workload. Dimensions such as the instance of an application, its version and so on, can cause a newly deployed application to generate a spike of new time series, just as the old ones become no longer active. Other behaviors will cause slow leaks of churn in the workload that introduce new series continuously over time. For example, if you have an application deployed in Kubernetes with horizontal pod autoscaling configured, then pods scaling up and down will create small amounts of churn with each new pod that is introduced. The most destructive examples come from metric anti-patterns, such as having dimensions that will have a unique value for (nearly) every request that an application handles. In such cases, workloads will have the maximum amount of churn and will cause stability issues in systems that are not designed to handle high cardinality.\n\nChurn in cloud native workloads\n\nNow that we understand the need to measure cardinality over time and how churn can affect it, let's discuss how cloud native architectures affect cardinality and churn. Because cloud native workloads tend to have many short-lived, or ephemeral containers, they will naturally generate a higher degree of churn in our metric workload. Everything from more frequent deployments across microservices, smaller-sized containers that scale up or down more frequently and intermittent jobs that run in the background will all naturally contribute to the churn that we can expect in our metrics and increase the amount of cardinality that we have to deal with over time.\n\nThe higher churn and resulting cardinality from cloud native workloads can easily overwhelm older time-series databases, which were designed with fewer, longer-lived time series than we see today in mind. Even when using newer TSDBs, it's important to keep an eye on the cardinality of your workload over time, particularly if you want to be able to effectively look at long-term trends in your data. Unfortunately, most TSDBs do not provide good visibility into this as part of their design. We noted how to understand the cardinality of your workload when using Prometheus earlier, but if you want to understand the cardinality for a subset of your data such as individual metrics, there are limited options to do so.\n\nFor Prometheus users, the only real option available here is via built-in functions like `count()` or `count_over_time()`. While these work to a degree, they are quite resource-intensive when it comes to higher cardinality series, exactly when we most care about having visibility into the behavior of our workload. The only other option available to us is to keep a close eye on workload-level metrics like `prometheus_tsdb_head_series` to try and catch increases in churn when they are introduced. This again becomes impractical for organizations at scale, when there are multiple teams and many different services being monitored that need to be accounted for whenever there is a change in behavior.", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "7aa17836-8091-4cf9-95ff-d42bbe8ab2fb", "url": "https://chronosphere.io/learn/how-cloud-native-workloads-affect-cardinality-over-time/"}
{"text": "Review Detail\n\n2012's The Amazing Spider-Man is actually one of the better Spidey films overall, but despite that one has to admit that it's all over the place. Too much going on at the same time, too many subplots that ultimately amount to nothing, too doubtful a tone. With so much executive meddling that it suffered, it's kind of a miracle it's even this watchable.\n\nSo what it needed was some streamlining and some focus, and that is exactly what this edit provides. Doesn't waste any time in filler subplots, instead getting to the core, a very comic-booky story about a relatable hero vs. a pitiable villain. It even fixes the one thing I found off in Andrew Garfield's Spidey portrayal: I found his quips more mean-spirited than playful, and the trims they receive in this cut render it close to how I always pictured our favorite arachnid. And the new ending does indeed pack quite the emotional punch.\n\nIf you like the theatrical release, you'll love this cut. If you don't, you will likely find a new appreciation for it in this form. Excelsior!\n\nNow, eagerly awaiting Part 2. And knowing how I feel about the theatrical TASM 2, that is quite a feat!\n\n(Incidentally: if you're a comic book fan there's something that may make you chuckle: the lyrics of the song used for a deleted scene happen to title-drop a certain infamous arc in the comics...)", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "d1939efa-415d-4f08-a7b8-9822a5764d48", "url": "https://ifdb.fanedit.org/amazing-spider-man-part-1-the/discussions/14336/"}
{"text": "Preparing Your Child for the Separation While You Birth the New Baby\n\nIf you're expecting a baby, and you already have one (or more) children, then your birth plans have an extra layer of complication. Many women\nworry about leaving their older child while they're giving birth to their new baby. It doesn't help that labor is unpredictable in both\ntiming and length, making it even harder to prepare a child who is often little more than a baby himself.\n\nIt\nis, of course, often possible for the child to stay with his or her other parent, rather than being left with a friend or relative. But we\nalso know that labor advances faster when women have support from a loved one, so most of the time a woman's partner stays with her during\nlabor and the older child is left in someone else's care.\n\nHow can you prepare your older baby, toddler or preschooler for this separation from mom, and maybe even from home?\n\n1. Strengthen and sweeten your relationship now.\n\nYour little one might well have a hard time during your absence from her. But a close relationship with you will give her a strong foundation,\nand provide the buffer she needs to recover quickly.\n\n2. Select the person who will take care of your little one while you are having the baby now, and start working with that person to prepare your child.\n\nLeave your child with this person as often as possible, for short and longer periods of time. Try to arrange, after months of this, for your child\nto nap there in order to get comfortable falling asleep. If your child does well napping, consider a sleepover – but don't push it. If your\nchild isn't ready, it isn't worth the potential trauma. If the birth requires a sleepover, so be it because it's unavoidable, but that one\nnight should be the only night unless the child is completely comfortable with this person.\n\n3. Don't try to get your child used to separation in general by leaving her with other people frequently.\n\nThat will just traumatize her and make her clingy. The goal is not to help her get used to separation and being with random people, because that\nis not how attachment works. The goal is to help her build a relationship with your designated person, whoever it will be, so that person can\ncalm her during your absence. The only thing that will help her cope with your absence is the presence of someone she trusts.\n\nIt's ok if your little one cries. What matters is that he has someone to comfort him while he cries, who won't just leave him to cry himself to\nsleep. Kids can make it through anything if they have someone to give them love and empathy.\n\n5. Start preparing your little one by talking\n\nStart preparing your little one by talking about how you will go to the hospital to have the baby and she will go to (the neighbor? grandma?) but\nyou will come to pick her up and take her home soon. You should stress that you ALWAYS come back to her. Make it a little mantra: \"And then Mommy will come and scoop you up because Mommy ALWAYS comes back!\"\n\n6. Make a book for your child.\n\nSince the separation from you when the baby is born can set the tone for the sibling's arrival, you might want to create a book that focuses just\non the pregnancy and separation. To make it easier for you to create your own personalized book, here is a template for you to use to get started.\nJust click the link below to download this template as a Word document. Then, personalize the the story, words and the picture choices as much\nas you would like to fit your own needs. Click here for the Downloadable Ebook.\n\nYour little one may not have a lot of words yet, but probably understands a lot. Reading a book like this that you make for him will help him understand\nmuch more.\n\n7. Help your little one develop some feeling of being comforted by a stuffed animal or lovey or a clothing item of yours...\n\npreferably smelling like you. No object will ever substitute for a person, but children can find comfort in a familiar object that they associate\nwith safety and with parents. Let the person who will care for your child during your labor use this comfort object to help your child when\nshe misses you.\n\n8. Stay positive and have confidence in your child.\n\nYour little one will weather this -- even if, heaven forbid, he cries himself to sleep in the arms of his caregiver. Your love and attention before\nand after will make all the difference in the world to his being able to handle the challenge.\n\nIf you're planning to have your child at the birth\n\nMany parents who had an uneventful first delivery are excited about the idea of including their older child in the magical moment of birth. Given\nthe unpredictability of the birth process, this is only desirable if you've arranged for a relative—someone your child is close to --\nto be with you during labor and to whisk your child away if the birth gets complicated or he gets bored.\n\nMy own 4 year old son came to the birth center with us and built a new lego while I labored, and was present for his sister's birth (up near my\nhead, holding my hand.) He loved being present when his baby sister was \"created,\" and has always been very protective of her.\n\nIf you decide to go this route, be sure you prepare your child.\n\nRead lots of birth books together.\n\nWatch birth videos that are appropriate for children; see if you can rent \"Gentle Birth Choices\" or \"Birth Day\" from your local library to\nwatch with your child. Her reaction can be a useful indicator as to whether she's ready to attend the actual birth.\n\nLet him help you push a large piece of furniture across the room. Point out that making loud noises, straining and sweating helps you work\nharder, and that labor is even more work.\n\nExplain in detail what will happen. It's important that your child know what to expect, including that the cord bleeds when it's cut, and that\nit doesn't hurt baby.\n\nPrepare your child for the way the baby will look.

{"text": "Types of Striking Tools\n\nAll TUFX hammers are ergonomically designed with the operator in thinking and examined by means of actual customers doing actual work, to make sure that they are convenient on the lower back and hands, to make sure each and every swing is best.\n\nWhy Choose Tufx Striking Tools?\n\nThe ergonomic design ensures every swing is a good hit and reduces stress on the back and hands. The design of the head provides a good balance between the head and shaft for safe, comfortable, and efficient use.\n\n3\n\nThe double injected handle with a solid fiberglass core delivers a powerful, sure strike in comfort and safety for your various projects. The non-slip rubber end grip ensures maximum control, strength, and durability.\n\nStriking Tools FAQ\n\nHow to Choose the Right Striking Tools?\n\nStriking tools are designed to perform specific hitting or striking tasks, it's important to select the right tools to get your job efficiently.\n\nHandle Length: If you work in a large space and do heavy-duty jobs, the long handle would be the first choice. If your work requires more precise chopping such as in a workshop, a shorter tool will perform better than a longer one.\n\nHandle Materials: The wood handle is environmentally friendly, however, it's subject to weather and climate. While fiberglass handles are more resistant to bugs, heat, and weathering. If you use the striking tool for outside work, a fiberglass handle may be a better option.\n\nSafety: The connection of head and handle is a very important factor for safety. You should study the design of the connection part, to ensure the head could not fall off under the heavy-duty job operating.\n\nWhat are the Features of Different Axes Styles?\n\nFelling axe is designed for felling trees. The long handle gives the users the leverage to generate the force needed to cut down trees. A sharp, thin blade helps to cut across the grain of the wood.\n\nSplitting maul is built to split logs. It is similar to a felling axe, but much heavier, giving you added strength when splitting a piece of wood, one end of the axe looks like a sledgehammer.\n\nMichigan axe has a curved head and is ideal for felling large trees and dense wood types. The back of the axe is small and has no practical effect. A heavier axe helps bring more weight to the entire axe, allowing it to bite deeper into the wood.\n\nAn hatchet is a small axe that can be used for several different purposes. They are great for quickly chopping down some firewood for a fire in camping. It can also be a handy tool when you need to cut through anything.\n\nHow to Take Care of Your Axe?\n\nWith proper care, an axe can last for generations.\n\nDon't leave your axe outside and exposed to the elements. When you're done with your axe, keep your axe sheathed and store it in a dry place like your garage or shed.\n\nKeep your axe sharp. As old sayings said, \"Give me six hours to chop down a tree and I will spend the first four sharpening the axe.\" It shows how essential it is to study how to sharpen an axe blade.\n\nNever use an axe as a hammer. Even though the butt end of an axe head makes for a convenient and tempting hammer. An axe is not a hammer, use it for driving in nails or stakes is not safe.\n\nAxes should be checked regularly. If they show signs of dents, cracks, chips, deformation, or excessive wear, they should be discarded rather than reworked.", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "99724ad9-dbea-4f43-b220-74fa7df40025", "url": "https://www.tufx.com/products/striking-tools/"}

{"text": "On this episode of Biohack-HERS, HigherDOSE Founders Lauren Berlingeri and Katie Kaps head to Vessel Floats in Brooklyn, New York to meet with the spa's founder Christian Redding and experience the hype around sensory deprivation therapy, a biohacking treatment consisting of a float tank and a total loss of connection to sight, sound, and touch.\n\nLauren and Katie climb into a pitch-black and soundproof saltwater tank to discover for themselves what happens to the mind without the senses. The one hour experience can be so profound that some people can encounter hallucinations while fully sober, as it is a natural way to have a mind-altering experience.\n\nThe tanks themselves are filled with one foot of water enriched by 1,000 pounds of epsom salt (aka, magnesium) to promote buoyancy in the body. To create full sensory deprivation, the saltwater is maintained at skin temperature to diminish feelings of touch, ear plugs are worn for total silence, and the tanks get so dark that you can't tell the difference between when eyes are opened and closed.\n\nSensory deprivation therapy is a somewhat terrifying experience at first, as many of us are not used to being alone with our thoughts while experiencing nothing. But, after some time in the tank, you begin to feel like you're floating in space and experiencing a ton of biohacking benefits, too. Sensory deprivation works to slow down brain waves until it reaches the theta state — that space between sleep and being awake and lucid. And, although it sounds counterintuitive, the experience can help alleviate feelings of anxiety, as well as reduce pain in the joints and muscles by breaking down lactic acid.

{"text": "Licensing Contacts\n\nAlzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the most prevalent and feared neurodegenerative diseases associated with aging, characterized by progressive neuronal loss and cognitive dysfunction. AD affects nearly 5 million Americans, and unfortunately, there is no cure as of yet. Numerous studies have implicated oligomeric amyloid beta (Aß) aggregates as toxic species in AD, and increasing evidence also implicates oligomeric forms of tau in the disease pathogenesis of AD and other taupathies. Well characterized reagents that can specifically recognize and distinguish between different aggregated states of tau are critically needed to identify biomarkers of AD and other taupathies and to study toxic mechanisms.\n\nResearchers at Arizona State University in collaboration with researchers at Oligomerix have successfully synthesized recombinant antibodies (nanobodies) for the treatment and early diagnosis of AD and other tauopathies such as Frontotemporal Dementia (FTD) and traumatic brain injury (TBI)-mediated neurodegeneration. These nanobodies specifically target toxic oligomeric tau but do not bind monomeric, fibrillar or non-disease associated form of tau.\n\nThese highly specific and selective nanobodies have great utility in diagnosing, treating and imaging tau related neurodegeneration.

{"text": "WHAT IF KIDS DON'T LEARN WHAT THEY ARE SUPPOSED TO?\n\nImagine if every thought you ever had, and every connection you made in your head, that made perfect sense to you, was evaluated by someone else and found to be wrong, or at the very least unimportant? This is effectively what children experience all the time at school. Someone else has decided what learning should look like, and discounts everything else that is going on for that child as irrelevant, or at the very least unimportant.\n\nImagine how it must feel to be experiencing life in glorious multicolour, combined with magnificent surround sound and incredible smells, exotic tastes, sensitive touch, and an acute awareness of all the feelings and connections that these sensations subjectively evoke in you, and then to have to switch off and ignore all of these stimuli to produce the one-dimensional answer that is expected of you in order to pass this test? This is the soul-destroying reality for most children, most of the time.\n\nWe think school is where children go to learn, but the reality in most cases is that school is where curiosity goes to die at the hands of one-dimensional, boring, hopelessly unnuanced curricula and learning materials that leave no space for true wisdom to emerge. Its like forcing our children to watch one version of life portrayed on a very small, very fuzzy black and white television set with poor sound quality, when their natural learning state is beyond even the most cutting-edge virtual-reality. It sounds pretty pathetic when you think of it that way, doesn't it?\n\nSo, this essay is about the importance of staying out of judgement about what, and how, is being learned by each child in each moment. At best we can only hazard a very hazy guess at the meaning that a child is constructing from the stimuli that he or she is exposed to in any moment. How limiting to decide that we KNOW what this child needs to know, and how best to deliver that knowing to him or her, and the exact timeframe in which it must be accomplished.\n\nI have heard teachers pronounce with great authority that \"this child is behind where they should be\", \"they are not at grade level in their reading/maths/you name it…\". Imagine if we flipped this dialogue on its head and started to try to understand what each child is actually learning right now? Imagine if schools could let go of the tiny little white envelope they have been living in forever and figure out how to support the emergence of an ever richer and more diverse technicolour of learning? Imagine if we could let go of the educational monoculture that we have been imprisoned in for so long and explore what educational biodiversity looks like?\n\nStrangely enough, the concept of educational freedom actually terrifies people. So many parents tell me they would never choose a learning environment like Misty Meadows for their children. \"What if my kids don't learn what they are supposed to?\" \"What if they are left behind their peers?\" \"What if there is a whole lot of stuff my children need to know, and if they aren't forced to learn it, they will fail to have a good life/earn a living/succeed?\" It is amazing how many parents really think these things. They don't trust their children to learn what they need to know to succeed in their own lives. They suspect their children might be \"less-than\" their peers in the brains department, and that if the child is left to figure things out for him or herself, he might \"FAIL\". Many parents also believe that the time spent in formal lessons is directly proportional to what their child will learn, and that therefore more time spent at school (or doing homework) equals more learning in a perfectly balanced equation. Pity humans are not as predictable as that… There is absolutely no guarantee that your child will actually learn what they are \"supposed to\" at school, or that if they don't, they will be left behind their peers, or fail in life. There is actually ample proof to the contrary. There is also ample proof that more lesson time very seldom equates directly to more (or better) learning.\n\nSo, what if we could let go of those frightened voices in our heads for a moment and explore what else might be possible for our children?\n\nFrom my own experience I would say the biggest enabler of learning for all children in every instance is joy, and the biggest disabler of learning is stress. When children are stressed, anxious or traumatised they do not learn well, regardless of the learning catalysts offered to them, and when children are enjoying themselves it is impossible for them not to learn, not just from the learning catalysts offered to them, but from all that they experience. Surely then the most important thing a parent can do to support their child learn most effectively is to choose a learning environment that minimises stress and maximises joy? It's worth considering, isn't it? Funny how many of us humans are wary of ideas that seem to be too good to be true, isn't it?\n\nAt Misty Meadows I am committed to us staying out of judgement about what learning should look like. I am committed to healing the traumas, stresses and anxieties that prevent children from learning, and to supporting and enabling joy in all of its forms. When you have experienced a group of children in a state of joy with each other, you will understand why this is learning dynamite. All their senses are fully engaged and the construction of rich and multifaceted meaning is truly inevitable when they are like this. Yes, you can offer learning catalysts, but that is all teaching ever is, a catalyst. You cannot force the child to learn from the catalyst – you just offer it and move on. If I had a dollar for every time I have been blown away by a child's unanticipated construction of meaning (learning) over the last 10 years, I would be rich. We cannot actually know what these children are actually capable of. All we can do is love them, trust them and watch what happens next. I'm truly enjoying the ride.\n\nThere is so much more I can say about this topic. For now, I just want to encourage parents and teachers to stay out of judgement about what learning looks like, and whether it is being accomplished effectively if the child does not look like they are learning (read: sitting quietly at a desk with book and pen in hand and a teacher in front of them), or a school doesn't look like it is teaching. Don't presume that you know what your child needs, or how it should be given to them. Your child is not you. This child may not process information the same way that you do. This child might think and experience life completely differently from you. In all likelihood that is the case. And that is a good thing!\n\nBeing able to spew facts is not proof that a child has learned something valuable to him or herself. Sometimes the journey towards constructing meaning is long and circuitous. I know – I am nearly 50 and I am still putting together building blocks and constructing more and better meaning for myself every day. What if there is no \"right answer\" as defined by anyone else. What if each child is on his or her own journey to find the right answer for him or herself? How sad if we force them down a straight and narrow path which might actually be a dead end for them, taking them nowhere? The most interesting children are often the ones who don't seem to be following a recognisable learning path at all. We call them failures, or at best disruptive, but maybe they are the true innovators who will eventually combine all of the many building blocks they have subjectively accumulated into something that nobody else could even have even dreamed of?\n\nMy purpose in these blog posts is not to dishearten people, but rather to lower the veil enough that people can start to question whether there might not be another way to support and enable children to thrive as the most capable versions of their own unique selves, well prepared for life after school? I think it is important to acknowledge that what I am suggesting about learning here is not the binary opposite of everything that currently exists under the banner of education, but rather it is a different lens through which to explore what is there and see whether it stands up to what this new perspective has revealed. Is the mainstream approach really a good way to teach children? Is it effectively achieving its objective? Or could there be another way that is more effective? Just think about it….", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "c53c4b33-47f1-49d5-83a7-e0607c0231d3", "url": "https://www.mistymeadowsschool.co.za/post/what-if-kids-don-t-learn-what-they-are-supposed-to"}

The cohiba ceremony was enacted by those who would know the\nwill of the gods.\n\nThe rolling mists were really a\npart of the cloudscape that blanketed the summits of the Northern Range. The\nbrilliance of the full moon appearing in an intermittent manner gave an\natmosphere to the scene that suggested phantoms. There may have been indeed\nsome.\n\nAs far as he knew, there was no\ndifference between himself and the elements about him: the earth, the moon, the\nsky from which the mist fell, soft rain to rise like mists again... The huge\nblack stone glistened in the damp. Its engraved pictures told a story that he\ncould read only with his heart. A tale so old that it no longer possessed\nbeginning or end, and like the mists it existed in a perpetual state of\nbecoming.\n\nThey say his name was Hy Arima,\nand that he had come to the top of Aripo to be at one with the navel of the\nworld. No one knows who put the pictureglyphs, rock carvings, on this huge\nbolder embedded in the flank of Cierro Aripo. There are some similar ones on\nthe main in Venezuela and in Colombia. There is no deciphering of these marks,\nand it is probably impossible to know how long ago they were made.\n\nThe story of the tribal people of\nthese islands can barely be gleaned through the mists of time - even though\ntheir history came to a violent end only some 300 years ago. So thorough was\nthe genocide committed by the Europeans of that time. It has been suggested\nthat the earliest Amerindians crossed over from Asia to the northern hemisphere\nsome 40,000 years ago of what became known as the New World. Much of the\nocean's water was then locked in the glaciers of the polar caps, and the level\nof the sea was extremely low.\n\nThese paleo-Indians, as they are\ncalled by archeologists, slowly traveled the length and breadth of north and\nsouth America. Hunters and collectors, they used simple tools of stone and\nwood. Some 15,000 to 20,000 years were to pass before the stone projectiles\nwere hefted on to wooden spears to hunt the large land mammals which populated\nthe savannahs of the Americas before the end of the ice age more effectively -\nthe spear was born. At kill sites in north west Venezuela, animal bones have\nbeen found which show traces of being cut through, and there were projectile\npoints and other stone implements. The West Indies were not inhabited during\npaleo-Indian times, probably because the earliest Amerindians lacked the skill\nof boat buildings.\n\nTrinidad, however, was still\nattached to the mainland during the final millennium of the ice age more than\n8,000 years ago. The Dragon's Mouth sealed the land bridge that connected the\nisland to the continent. Complete skeletons of ice age animals have been found\nin Trinidad, but no kill sites have yet been discovered. Archeologists like Dr.\nAri Boomert, formerly attached to U.W.I., feel convinced that deep in the\nsouthern forest of the island those kill sites are still awaiting discovery.\n\nAs the climate of the world\nchanged, the ice melted and the seas rose. Trinidad was cut off from the\nmainland, and possibly Tobago from Trinidad. A different life now emerged for\nthose who lived on this newly made island. The enormous sloth, together with\nother huge mammals, was now extinct, and the natives, now describes as\nmeso-Indians, altered their life styles. Arrows replaced spears, as animals\nwere now smaller. Shellfish and crustaceans became the main source of food..\nThis forced a knowledge of the sea and seafood, evidenced by fish bones and\nshells which can be found in huge middens. Those middens could have been in use\nfor hundreds of years.\n\nBoat building enabled the\nmeso-Indians to explore and settle in the islands of the Caribbean chain. The\noldest evidence of a settlement suggest a date of some 7,000 years ago and are\nlocated in the south east of Trinidad. It has been suggested, however, that the\nBanwari midden, a shell heap at Oropouche, may well be older. These refuse\nheaps contain bones of deer, agoutis, wild cats and monkeys, and also caimans,\niguanas and birds. Specialised tools and weapons were now developed for hunting\nand food processing. Ground stone tools such as mortars and pestles for\ngrinding nuts, well polished bone points for fish spears, and finely ground\nstone axes for felling trees were used by the meso-Indians.\n\nLife remained unaltered for\nthousands of years. It was not until approximately 300 B.C. that the Guianas\nand Trinidad were invaded by Indians with a far more advanced type of culture -\nIndians who possessed the knowledge of land cultivation, of crops such as\nbitter manioc and sweet potatoes, of making pottery and polishing stone\nimplements, of spinning cotton into thread and weaving it into cloth. Those\nIndians were a people with a way of living and a society fundamentally\ndifferent from that of the hunters, fishers and food gatherers of the previous\nepoch.\n\nThese people came out of the\nOrinoco river system, from what would later be called Venezuela and the\nGuianas, and they are known today as neo-Indians. Archeologists also call them\nSaladoid people, after a site of that name in eastern Venezuela. The Saladoid\npeople were the first to organise agriculture, villages and long distance\ntravel. They made cassava bread from the manioc root, once the prussic acid had\nbeen squeezed out. Baked into large disks, the cassava loaves could be kept for\nweeks.\n\nIt may be guessed that the\nSaladoid people may have been the first Arawakan-speaking people in the West\nIndies. After 300 A.D., another wave of adventurers, the Barrancos, crossed the\nnarrow sea to Trinidad. These were absorbed by the earlier settlers. The\ndifference between them may only be observed by the respective styles of their\npottery decoration. These new people migrated to Tobago, and, according to\nBoomert, influenced the Saladoid peoples of the Lesser Antilles.\n\nBoomert points out that the\nmajority of objects made by the neo-Indians were manufactured of perishable\nmaterials, featherwork, basket work and textiles, and as such little idea may\nbe gleaned of their artistic skills. What has survived, however, is pottery or\nobjects made from stone or shell with the notable exception of a number of\nfinds from the Pitch Lake, wooden paddles, war clubs, a bench, a mortar and a\nbowl.\n\nSome burial sites have been\ndiscovered as well, which contain stone axes and pots with remains of food -\nall this to sustain the deceased on his or her journey to the hereafter.\n\nThe legend of Hy Arima is but a\nwhisper in the vast testimony of a now vanished people. The place names around\nthe country echo the words from a distant time and serve to maintain a memory\nof when this land was theirs. We, who have come after, should hold all this in\ntrust, and be awed by the ghostly presence of Trinidad and Tobago's ancient\ntribal people.", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "4048bd96-b173-45ee-b2c3-2e920e544e22", "url": "http://caribbeanhistoryarchives.blogspot.com/2011/11/hy-arima.html"}

{"text": "Six years earlier, news had been bad: the winter herring had failed for the first time in 50 years. How would the small scale farmers supplement their earnings without the herring fishing?\n\nThere were several attempts to establish alternative industry. In the meantime unemployment and discontent spread. The fishing fleet was disbanded, and many of the shipyards were now too small for the increasing tonnage of the merchant fleet. Rationalization in agriculture and fisheries led to further job losses. The oil industry had not yet been conceived.\n\nHowever, at the end of the 1950s the Oslo newspapers announced that Hydro intended to set up an operation in Rogaland county on the west coast. Two people in particular followed this up: Styrk Fjærtoft, the local policeman in Sveio and the mayor of Tysvær, Ånen Susort. Fjærtoft found out how many people were unemployed in the district and Susort asked Ottar Odland in the Norwegian state broadcasting system to cast the limelight onto Hydro and push for some answers.\n\nPower transmission\n\nBut Hydro was not to be hurried. The power supply had to be ensured before any such major decision could be taken. And the amount of power for an industrial site large enough to make a real impact was enormous.\n\nHowever this could be provided by electricity lines running across the country from east to west. The possibility of transmitting electricity over considerable distances without significant loss meant that industry no longer had to be restricted to narrow waterways. Local politicians supported the use of power from Røldal-Suldal that Hydro had rights to.\n\nThe other type of power needed – manpower – was plentiful. Over 1,000 people were looking for working on Karmøy.\n\nIn the end local campaigners managed to persuade Hydro's technical director Rolf Heggenhougen and head of technical building Arne Giæver to choose Håvik on Karmøy as the site of the new plant.\n\nOver to aluminium\n\nBut what was Hydro to produce on Karmøy – mineral fertilizer, PVC or aluminium? The question required careful consideration, but the rights to electricity from Røldal-Suldal meant the company had access to power that could be used for more than fertilizer production.\n\nManaging director Rolf Østbye felt aluminium was the obvious choice. But there was opposition from key persons in the Norwegian parliament and administration. One of the strongest opponents was Erik Brofoss, former Minister of Trade and Finance and now head of the Bank of Norway. Bro-foss thought it was nonsense for Hydro to get involved in aluminium when \"everyone\" knew that the future was in polythene and PVC.\n\nBut aluminium it was to be. For the fishermen and farmers on Karmøy, this was the start of a new future: no more setting out to sea in the biting cold of February looking for herring. Work would now follow shifts, which meant keeping different hours. But unlike fishing, the new lifestyle would be predictable.\n\nThe Harvey brothers join the scene\n\nThis was more or less a new product for Hydro, and a partner had to be found. First they contacted the French company Pechiney, later Canadian Alcan and American Alcoa became candidates. Both were interested in working with Hydro.\n\nNegotiations drew out, and it was finally former UN general secretary Trygve Lie who contacted Harvey Aluminium in California. The company was owned and run by the Harvey brothers, who had built up a significant semi-manufacturing operation in the US.\n\nHydro could see the advantage of working with a company that was independent, but not too large. The main thing was that Harvey was able to supply sound technology for building up an integrated aluminium operation such as Hydro had in mind.\n\nThe agreement with the American brothers resulted in the formation of the company Alnor Aluminium Norway A/S, where Hydro held 51 and Harvey 49 per cent of the shares. The company was registered in the Karmsund Register of Companies on 11 June 1963.\n\nHydro buy-back\n\nAfter a ten year partnership with Harvey Aluminum, Alnor became a wholly-owned Hydro subsidiary on 3 May 1973. The purchase price was USD 20 million.\n\nHydro had wanted to take sole ownership of the Karmøy operation for some time. But it was not unit the Harvey company was purchased by the industry magnate Martin Marietta that this could be realized. Marietta hesitated for a while, but, as mentioned, let Alnor go for USD 20 million. This was hardly a business success for the seller – Hydro earned back the 20 million in just two years!\n\nMetal plates and profiles\n\nThe original plan for the Karmøy development was first to build an extrusion plant to produce profiles from purchased metal, and then to follow this with potroom, casthouse and rolling mill. Harvey had good experience from its extrusion plants in the US.\n\nHowever the extrusion unit was the last to be built, and trial operation started on 14 January 1969. The potroom and rolling mill had begun production on 17 June the previous year. The rolling mill was small compared to its European counterparts, but was the first of its kind in that it used molten metal from the adjoining potroom.\n\nThe rolling mill was also based on Harvey technology and the strip cast method. The results were good for the first years, but business cycles caused problems. There were periods during which management would have preferred to produce ingots than raw band and thin plates.\n\nAluminium to Europe\n\nThe first shipment of aluminium from Karmøy set course for China, but it was in the European market that it gained the greatest foothold. The European aluminium industry in the sixties was mainly based on the national tariff barriers within the EEC and EFTA.\n\nHydro chose to focus on setting up sales offices in EFTA, and these sprouted up one after the other in London, Manchester, Bad Dürkheim and Helsinki. These office were set up to sell profiles, rolled products and wire rod, and were under the absolute control of Karmøy. They also helped Al-nor Aluminium Norway A/S to become an international aluminium company.\n\nHowever setting up a sales organization was not a simple matter. These were technical products that the sellers needed to know and understand. So Alnor encouraged engineers and metallurgists to take up sales work in a serious way.\n\nCompetitors in Europe were by no means delighted to have a newcomer in the market. They tried to obstruct Alnor's progress, and the EEC applied anti-dumping measures to make the Karmøy plant cut production during periods of over-production. But to no avail. While other companies cut back 10-20 per cent, Alnor ran at full capacity. And sold its metal.\n\nVolume increases to European top\n\nFrom a humble beginning as a problematic plant with limited production volume, Alnor, later renamed Karmøy Fabrikker, entered a new category of electrolysis plant due to two extensions. The first was the KIII extension. Hydro applied for a power concession for the extension in 1974, but had to wait until 1978 for the go-ahead.\n\nHydro's corporate assembly approved the KII development in September 1980. This meant an increase in capacity of around 50,000 tonnes from 110,000 tonnes to 162,000 tonnes.\n\nOne of the reasons behind the development was forecasts indicating that there would be a shortage of metal in the 1980s. Hydro also wanted to take part in the development of Norwegian industry. But perhaps equally important was the fact that the company needed more metal in its own semi-manufacturing facilities in Europe.\n\nNow was the time to choose what technology to invest in. The recommendation was for the French Pechiney system with closed electrolysis cells equipped with baked anodes, which had strong environmental advantages.

All those include staying home, masking, social isolating, or limited travel.\n\nThey're likewise influencing contamination rates and the circumstance of occasional floods of other normal respiratory system sicknesses, as for each an article dispersed July 23 in Morbidity and Fatality Weekly Report.\n\nUsually, respiratory pathogens such as common chilly coronaviruses, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parainfluenza viruses, and respiratory system adenoviruses increase in the fall and remain high all through winter.

Although the historically low rates of influenza continued to be low into springtime 2021, that is not the situation for a lot of other common breathing viruses.\n\nPhysicians ought to know about raises in some respiratory system computer virus activity and stay vigilant for winter raises, wrote Sonja J.

{"text": "Beyond ingenuity\n\nIn January 2024, NASA's Ingenuity Mars Helicopter completed its final flight in the Martian skies after a hard landing damaged its rotor blades. But that ending shouldn't overshadow the fact of the helicopter's remarkable durability.\n\nOriginally designed to perform five planned demonstration flights over a 30-day mission, Ingenuity instead logged 72 flights and travelled 14 times farther than expected, ultimately extending its mission to nearly three years. Such overperformance is even more notable from a piece of equipment that cost only $85 million to build and operate in the first place — a fraction of the $2.4 billion the agency has spent on the Mars 2020 Perseverance mission in total.\n\nIngenuity's legacy includes a wealth of new data about the challenges of flying in an alien atmosphere, but it also highlights the growing role and value of commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) products in aerospace manufacturing. Like many other satellite and spacecraft designers, Ingenuity's engineers relied on COTS components to reduce its cost and accelerate production. With each of these applications, manufacturers are demonstrating the value of COTS components in space. Those lessons, in turn, are helping component designers here on Earth dial in the right component specifications to support missions more cost effectively. As a result, we're seeing an acceleration of noteworthy technologies and manufacturing techniques that are reshaping the aerospace industry.\n\nMaking space for COTS\n\nSpace-related manufacturing has historically come at a high cost because equipment like satellites were designed to last decades or more. That process included custom-made parts developed for harsh conditions with no possibility of replacement. The James Webb Telescope, for example, operates at temperatures of 22 Kelvin (-250˚C), nearly a million miles from Earth. Any materials likely to release gases under those conditions risk contaminating the telescope's mirrors and optical components. As a result, traditional space equipment tends to be larger, heavier and takes years to develop.\n\nTE goes beyond product offerings to partnership in innovation\n\nRecently, though, new launch technologies have reduced the cost to send equipment into space, and in response designers and manufacturers have shifted their focus. For example, the latest generation of low-Earth-orbit (LEO) satellites emphasise lower cost, smaller size and fast assembly, which has designers turning to consumer-grade computer hardware and other COTS components to produce satellites in as little as 18 months. As replacement with COTS components is a more economical option, LEO satellite makers can launch multiple satellites to provide backups, and to anticipate shorter equipment lifespans.\n\nTE Connectivity (TE) stands out in this dynamic market with a wide-ranging portfolio tailored to the rigors of LEO application. By developing noteworthy technology like the STRADA Whisper backplane connectors, Micro-D and D-subminiature backshells, fibre optics, active optical cable assemblies, and 369 connectors to name a few, TE goes beyond product offerings to partnership in innovation. Its engineers champion the charge, working with satellite manufacturers to address their specific design challenges and capitalising on TE's time-tested experience in the industry.\n\nAerospace evolution\n\nChanging space missions are providing more opportunities to use COTS components. For example, LEO satellites operate much closer to Earth and below the Van Allen radiation belt, which means their components operate in a much less harsh environment than satellites in higher orbits. Those conditions open the door to a broader spectrum of components between consumer grade and bespoke, space-qualified technology. That spectrum covers everything from existing automotive- or aerospace grade-components to slightly modified 'COTS+' components that are still more cost effective than traditional space-grade hardware.\n\nManufacturers are already beginning to incorporate a range of different component types into their designs where specifications warrant. At the same time, latest component suppliers can work closely with these manufacturers to support their design objectives. For example, component manufacturers are playing a key role in helping reduce the overall size and weight of space equipment by miniaturising critical components, particularly those related to power and communications connectivity. The smaller, lighter and more durable these components become, the more room manufacturers have for custom-developed technology or for components that must meet higher specifications.\n\nIn addition to helping to reduce costs, the use of COTS components speeds up technology advancement cycles. Engineers can iterate more quickly around a set of standardised components. And shorter mission cycles also offer the potential to upgrade technology at a faster clip than was possible with traditional space equipment manufacturing.\n\nAccelerating innovation\n\nSpace-grade electronic and electromechanical parts that have been radiation hardened and engineered to perform under the harshest conditions will always be necessary, especially in cases like the James Webb Telescope or mission-critical satellites designed to last 25 to 30 years in geosynchronous orbit. As the breadth of aerospace applications has expanded, however, the tolerance requirements for the components needed to fulfil a specific mission have become better defined.\n\nMatching component specifications to a specific mission requires a balance between cost, size, weight and durability. Where COTS components can support a minimum specification, their use makes sense. As Ingenuity proved, these components can even exceed expectations. More importantly, COTS components themselves are not a static set of parts. As applications and environments change, component manufacturers can develop new grades of COTS components engineered to meet the evolving specifications of the vehicles that use them.\n\nTE has made contributions to space technology for more than 75 years\n\nThis isn't a new phenomenon. In the automotive industry alone, we've seen specifications for COTS components change in areas such as the wiring of electric vehicles. There are also potential applications for the same components across different industries. The development of electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) aircraft has leveraged COTS components from automotive, military and aerospace technologies to meet the specifications of short-distance, low-altitude, electric-powered flight.\n\nCross-industry use is possible because many of the components execute similar tasks across applications. Durable connections for transmitting power and data, in particular, tend to be universal. Component manufacturers with deep experience in these areas and a wide range of existing products can help engineers match design specifications to the most cost-effective alternative currently available.\n\nShaping the future\n\nTE's legacy of mission critical reliability in the space industry dates to the first US satellite, Explorer 1, launched in 1958. TE remained an important player in the then-nascent industry; for example, its components were used in the first lunar rovers that were deployed in the early 1970s and continue to be used today. Such layered involvement during this era laid the foundation for TE's continued contributions to space technology and exploration for more than 75 years.\n\nAlong the way, we've seen how evolving specifications have helped manufacturers design high-performing equipment faster and more cost effectively. Today, instead of creating bespoke parts from scratch, engineers have a much broader range of options from which to choose the right component at the right level of complexity and robustness for the task they need.\n\nAs we learn more about the environment in which space equipment operates - and gain greater experience with the performance of COTS in those environments - opportunities for technological advancement continue to grow. And as we've seen with Ingenuity Mars helicopter, these innovations will increasingly lead to scientific breakthroughs that are driving one of the most exciting periods in the history of space exploration.\n\nThales has", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "b6cb0681-be27-49f7-86c1-6b745b4bcde7", "url": "https://www.aero-mag.com/beyond-ingenuity"}

{"text": "Testosterone for older men\n\nEmma Henshall\n\nHow testosterone impacts men's health and when to consider treatment\n\nYou might think that more testosterone means greater vitality and wellbeing, but it's more complicated than that says Professor Bu Yeap, consultant endocrinologist at Fiona Stanley Hospital, WA.\n\nAccording to results from the Western Australian Health In Men Study (HIMS) of men aged 70 and older, there's an optimal amount of testosterone for good health outcomes.\n\n\"You are at greater risk of dying if your testosterone is low. But if it's really high, your risk is going up again – there's actually a 'U' shape association of testosterone with mortality risk in older men,\" Professor Yeap says.\n\nSo, what is the optimal testosterone level and how do we help men achieve it?\n\nIn the HIMS study, the optimal range of circulating total T was approximately 10 to 15 nmol/L and was associated with improved survival independent of risk factors such as age and obesity.\n\nA new international meta-analysis led by the University of Western Australia shows that in healthy men, testosterone levels are generally stable until they reach their 70s. After that, testosterone levels decrease with increasing age, while luteinising hormone levels rise. However, healthy men aged 40-69 years maintain stable testosterone levels for some time, according to the UWA research which followed men for 4.3 years.\n\n\"The healthier you are, the better you maintain your testosterone production. When you hit your 70s, testosterone production from the testes begins to decrease, so you want to be in the best possible situation leading up to then,\" Professor Yeap explains.\n\nIt's about body composition\n\nThe T4DM study of approximately 1,000 Australian men aged 50-74 years, all with central obesity and impaired glucose tolerance or newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes, highlighted the benefits of maintaining lean mass – something made easier with testosterone.\n\nAll participants received a Weight Watchers program with half the group randomised to receive testosterone and the other half assigned to placebo. The men who were given testosterone gained lean mass (0.4 kg) and lost fat (4.6 kg), while the placebo group lost lean mass (1.3 kg) and didn't lose as much fat (1.9 kg). At two years, the testosterone group had a 40% lower risk of type 2 diabetes than the placebo group (P=0.0007).\n\n\"We randomised men to testosterone or placebo for two years, and guess what, at the end of two years, if you had received testosterone, your risk of having type 2 diabetes was 40% lower. This is a really robust result,\" Professor Yeap says.\n\nHowever, testosterone treatment is not without risks, such as an increase in haemoglobin concentrations, and the need for prostate assessments—there are no specific recommendations for the frequency of assessments, as these need to be individualised according to age and risk factors, Professor Yeap adds.\n\n\"Therefore, if you can achieve those changes in body composition some other way, for instance healthy lifestyle behaviours including resistance exercise, that could be a preferred course of action,\" he says.\n\nInterpreting testosterone levels\n\nA recent study of 25,000 men found that many factors are associated with lower testosterone levels, including:\n\na higher BMI\n\nreduced physical activity\n\ncardiovascular disease\n\ncancer\n\ndiabetes\n\nand even being married or in a de facto relationship.\n\nIt's important to consider such factors when interpreting testosterone results.\n\n\"There are sociodemographic, lifestyle and medical factors that influence testosterone concentrations. Of these, the top four are age, BMI, diabetes and cancer —when you look at a testosterone result, you should be thinking about all these factors that might influence it,\" Professor Yeap says.\n\nWhen is testosterone replacement therapy indicated?\n\nIn men with symptoms suggestive of androgen deficiency, it is essential to determine whether hypothalamic-pituitary-testicular (HPT) disease exists or not.\n\nWhen HPT disease is present, preventing the production of testosterone, and the patient has signs and symptoms of androgen deficiency, testosterone treatment is warranted.\n\nContraindications for testosterone treatment would include presence of polycythaemia or prostate cancer.\n\n\"If a man comes to you and they're worried, or someone's done a testosterone test and it's a little low, this is what I do: I ask myself, does this man have hypothalamic, pituitary or testicular disease that's causing him to be androgen deficient? If the answer is yes, he should be treated, provided there are no contraindications and that's what he really wants,\" Professor Yeap says.\n\nIn other men who do not have HPT disease, he recommends a holistic approach, addressing lifestyle behaviours, especially exercise, and managing any risk factors or medical comorbidities that may be present.\n\n\"We really need to be encouraging men to take an interest in their health, and testosterone is a great conversation starter. Because if they have HPT axis disease, we can treat them really effectively; if they don't, there's all these other things we can do to improve their health,\" Professor Yeap says.\n\nFor more information on assessment and indications for testosterone therapy, Professor Yeap recommends this position statement from the Endocrine Society of Australia.\n\nKey points:\n\nTestosterone production declines after the age of 70\n\nEncourage healthy lifestyle behaviours to preserve HPT axis function\n\nUse testosterone as a men's health conversation starter with your patients", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "48337a19-0e74-4702-bb71-2c251575d782", "url": "https://www.healthed.com.au/clinical_articles/testosterone-for-older-men/"}

{"text": "Gender Critical Beliefs and Discrimination in the Workplace\n\nPublished on 21 Jul 2022 – including a belief that sex is immutable and should not be conflated with gender identity, and that trans women are men – on Twitter and at work.\n\nBackground\n\nReligion or belief is a protected characteristic under the Equality Act 2010, and it is direct discrimination to treat a person less favourably because of their religion or belief.\n\nIn some cases a respondent may argue that the reason for less favourable treatment is not the belief itself, but the way in which the claimant has manifested it.\n\nThere is distinction between:\n\nCases where the reason for less favourable treatment is the fact that the claimant holds and/or manifests a protected belief. This would amount to direct discrimination because of belief.\n\nCases where the reason for less favourable treatment is that the claimant had manifested that belief in some particular way to which objection could justifiably be taken. In these cases it is the objectionable manifestation of the belief, and not the belief itself, which is treated as the reason for the act complained of. However, if the consequences of the objectionable manifestation are not such as to justify the action taken against the employee, this cannot sensibly be treated as separate from an objection to the belief itself.\n\nFacts\n\nIn November 2016, Ms Forstater was employed as a Visiting Fellow by CGD Europe on a one-year contract, and her contract was renewed in each of the following two years.\n\nMs Forstater believes that (i) a person's sex is a material reality that should not to be conflated with gender or gender identity, (ii) a person's sex is an immutable biological fact, not a feeling or an identity, and that a trans woman is not in reality a woman, and (iii) while a person can identify as another sex and ask other people to go along with it, and can change their legal sex under the Gender Recognition Act 2004 (GRA), this does not change their actual sex.\n\nMs Forstater engaged in debates on social media about gender identity issues, and made a number of statements in opposition to the government's proposed amendments to the GRA. In doing so she made some remarks which some trans people found offensive. She also brought into the office and posted on twitter materials by campaigning organisation Fair Play for Women, which described allowing gender self-identification (self-ID) as stupid, dangerous and unfair to women. Some of Ms Forstater's colleagues complained that they found her conduct offensive, and her fellowship was not renewed for a third time.\n\nMs Forstater brought claims, including of direct discrimination, alleging that the decision not to renew her contract was because of her gender critical belief. At a preliminary hearing, an employment tribunal concluded that Ms Forstater's beliefs did not qualify for protection, but that decision was overturned on appeal and so her claims were allowed to continue. The employer argued that the reason for the non-renewal of Ms Forstater's contract was the way in which she had expressed her belief, and not the fact that she held it.\n\nDecision\n\nThe key issue was the reason why the employer had decided not to continue Ms Forstater's employment.\n\nThe tribunal held that the ways in which Ms Forstater manifested her gender critical beliefs had had a significant influence on the employer's decision. The question therefore arose as to whether Ms Forstater had manifested her beliefs in a manner to which objection could reasonably be taken or, to put it another way, manifested them in an inappropriate manner. In doing so, the tribunal reminded itself that it would be an error to treat a mere statement of a protected belief as inherently unreasonable or inappropriate, as this would be in effect to hold that the belief is not worthy of protection: even beliefs that may be profoundly offensive or distressing to others must still be tolerated in a pluralist society.\n\nThe tribunal found that none of the manifestations of Ms Forstater's belief, whether taken individually or collectively, were objectively offensive or unreasonable; and, further, that it was not necessarily the case that crossing the line on a single occasion would have been sufficient to justify action being taken against her.\n\nMs Forstater had tweeted about Pips Bunce, a gender-fluid person who had received an accolade aimed at female executives. Ms Forstater had written that \"the FT were wrong to put him on a list of top female executives and wrong for him to accept the award\", and described them as a \"man in heels\", and \"a part time cross dresser who mainly goes by the name of Phillip\". The tribunal considered this an uncomplimentary and dismissive observation that had been intended to be provocative, but that while the point \"could have been made in more moderate terms\", the majority held that it was not an objectionable or inappropriate manifestation of Ms Forstater's belief, given the context of a debate on a matter of public interest.\n\nMs Forstater had stated that \"people should of course be able to define their identity anyway they like but other people are not compelled to accept it as relating to any material reality\" and that \"a man's internal feeling that he is a woman has no basis in material reality\". The tribunal considered these to be straightforward statements of Ms Forstater's protected gender critical belief, and so not something to which objection could reasonably be taken.\n\nMs Forstater had drawn comparisons between trans women and Rachel Dolezal, a white woman who had caused controversy when she claimed to be black. The tribunal held that the point being made was little more than an assertion of Ms Forstater's gender critical belief.\n\nIn response to a question about why a concern for women's safety meant that she could not \"acknowledge [trans women's] womanhood in normal life\", Ms Forstater had replied, \"Because the places that women and girls get assaulted and harassed are 'normal life!!!' At school. At work. In churches. At sport centres. On dates. In bars. On trains. In lifts. At conferences …\". The employer had characterised this as \"catastrophising\" from a discussion about all-male interview panels into a discussion about extreme violence. The tribunal considered that what Ms Forstater had written was an unobjectionable observation in the course of the debate, and that even if this was an expression of a worst-case scenario, it was not an objectively unreasonable observation to make.\n\nMs Forstater had said that \"Under \"self ID\" a transwoman is any male who identifies as a woman (a feeling in their head). I am a woman, but I don't have a feeling in my head\". The tribunal rejected the employer's argument that that the reference to \"feeling in their head\" inappropriately equated self-ID with mental illness, and held that it was little more than asserting Ms Forstater's gender critical belief.\n\nMs Forstater had mocked those who did not share her beliefs, saying \"What I am so surprised at is that smart people who I admire…are tying themselves in knots to avoid saying the truth that men cannot change into women\". The tribunal observed that mockery or satire is part of the \"common currency of debate\" and that, while it might reach a level of being objectively unreasonable, this was a \"fairly mild\" example and clearly had not.\n\nMs Forstater left a Fair Play for Women campaign booklet in the office. The tribunal found that the booklet was expressed in \"robust, campaigning terms\" and referred to \"the stupidity, danger and unfairness of sex self-ID\" which it said would lead to an increase in the \"risks, threats and discomfort to cis women\". The tribunal held that the booklet was an expression of the core gender critical belief, and that in a debate of this nature it is not objectively unreasonable or offensive to describe the opposing view as stupid, dangerous or unfair. In any event, Ms Forstater had agreed with the employer that she should not have left the booklet in the office, and so would not do so again.\n\nMs Forstater posted a Fair Play for Women campaign video on Twitter which promoted similar arguments to the above booklet, accompanied by ominous or threatening music and imagery, and red and black lettering which the employer argued was reminiscent of Nazis. The tribunal found there was nothing unusual about music and illustrations being used in this way, whether in political campaigns or commercial advertising, and there was nothing objectively offensive about using red and black.\n\nIn an internal discussion about self-ID on the employer's instant messaging system, Ms Forstater had included a link to an article about a paedophile. Ms Forstater had said about the link in cross examination that \"I am not saying this is a reason for not recognising trans people. I'm saying there are people using the trans movement to silence people who are campaigning for safeguarding\". The tribunal held that there was nothing objectively offensive or unreasonable about her use of an actual case to illustrate her argument about safeguarding.\n\nFirst instance decisions such as this are not binding on future tribunals – but they can act as persuasive authority.\n\nOne of the interesting aspects of this judgment is the tribunal's analysis of the communications that were alleged to have caused offence. The tribunal acknowledged that where a belief is protected, straightforward statements of that belief must also be protected. It also allowed Ms Forstater a certain latitude in how her belief could be legitimately expressed, for example, by accepting that satirising or mocking an opposing view is part of the \"common currency of debate\" and should therefore be protected to some degree, as could statements that are intended to be provocative. The tribunal also acknowledged that a single inappropriate manifestation of a belief would not necessarily justify action being taken; rather, the employee's conduct should be considered as a whole.\n\nWhere to draw the line in individual cases will be very fact-sensitive, and will no doubt remain an area for conjecture in similar cases going forward. Employers will always have to walk the tightrope of trying to balance their employees' rights to hold a philosophical belief against other employees' right not to be discriminated against because of their protected characteristic, and we would encourage employers faced with grievances against, or otherwise concerns relating to the conduct of, employees who express philosophical beliefs to obtain our advice.\n\nIt is as yet not known whether CGD Europe will appeal.\n\nIf you require any advice about the issues addressed in this blog, please contact me or another member of the Employment Team..", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "ec7ddd8e-9c6b-4fdf-953d-eef59c325119", "url": "https://www.lblaw.co.uk/knowledge/blog/gender-critical-beliefs-and-discrimination-in-the-workplace/"}
{"text": "This new blog series takes a look at the disruptions changing air cargo and its transport the world around. Strap in for a bumpy flight.\n\nCommonly employed for high value or highly perishable products, air cargo transport is increasingly used as more individuals and businesses purchase products on-line and expect delivery in a very short period of time. Modal mix is becoming more common as supply chain and logistics managers juggle choices to fulfill the expectations of the beneficial cargo owners (BCO). Sea-air services are expanding which combine the cost value of maritime transport with the higher speeds of air services and a lower environmental footprint when time permits.\n\nWhile leisure passenger traffic is recovering, the higher margin business travel is only slowly returning to the skies. The slow recovery has many effects on the commercial aviation industry. The most striking impact is a loss of capacity, especially on international routes. With many widebody passenger aircraft sidelined due to lower passenger loads, the capacity for cargo shipments has shrunk.\n\nQuite simply, the worldwide air cargo logistics industry is continuously beset by challenges, which can be turned into opportunities by organizations that are adept and flexible. The vibrancy, vitality, resiliency and sustainability of the industry is critical for the socio-economic well being of everyone in the world.\n\nThis blog series will focus on key areas changing the air cargo industry as you read this. They include the value of air cargo transport, the different roles of air cargo, disruptions to the worldwide air cargo logistics industry, and new developments that contribute to the industry's vitality.\n\nKeep in mind that:\n\nChange is constant – a delayed reactive response is death.\n\nThe worldwide air cargo logistics industry has experienced a series of disruptions which can be traced back to the early 1970s with the emergence of the integrated air carriers.\n\nThere is a cumulative impact from: the COVID pandemic; increasing reliance on e-commerce/high-speed delivery expectations; digitalization; expansion of ocean carriers into the air cargo services and operations; consideration of climatic issues; and an unsettled geopolitical environment. All are challenging traditional structures, services, and relationships.\n\nThe realization by governments and businesses that a global supply chain is critical for both socio-economic and business viability going forward.\n\nThere is a misunderstanding of air transport and its role in the global well being.\n\nSo we are all on the same page, here are some key terms to keep in mind:\n\nThe worldwide air cargo logistics industry is more extensive than the traditional focus on airlines, freight forwarders, ground handling agents, and trucking companies. Actually, it\nencompasses all of the parties involved in handling and moving air cargo shipments including truckers, freight forwarders, ground handling agents, clearance agents/customs house brokers, border agencies, digital platform and service providers, airports, airlines, 3PL companies, crating and packing companies as well as security and safety inspectors.\n\nThe term beneficial cargo owners (BCO) encompasses all parties who 'own' the freight. They can be the physical shipper, the final consignee, or increasingly the party which takes ownership of the shipment and may never handle it but gains a tangible benefit from each shipment. Increasingly, the BCO is the party which orders the product. Each one of who selects a product on an e-commerce platform is a BCO. We dictate what is being ordered, where and when it is to be delivered. We defer to the platform operator as to the method of transport. But through track and trace applications, we monitor the process of the shipment though the supply web.\n\nSupply chains/webs – the complexity of supply processes is leading to the replacement of sequential chains with complex webs. The webs are composed of individual chains, but the webs facilitate modal shifting, sourcing of similar goods from different locations, and a plethora of pathways to move the goods to the point of delivery.\n\nSeveral disruptions have affected the worldwide air cargo logistics industry over time. These disruptions reinforce the notion that it is not appropriate to rely on prior traffic characteristics to forecast future air cargo volumes.\n\nKey disruptions here include:\n\nYears ago, the emergence of the integrated cargo companies—Burlington Air Express, CF Air Freight, DHL, Emery Air Freight, FedEx, TNT, UPS and others—challenged legacy airlines. They had to re-think their business models and provide a new, innovative option for individual and corporate beneficial cargo owners to employ air cargo services to move their goods. As in every instance of industrial change, the list of companies has declined to DHL, FedEx and UPS.\n\nOnline / e-commerce platforms have upset the apple cart in recent years. These companies, employing sophisticated data collection processes and complex algorithms are customer centric. They have leveraged the expectation of high-speed delivery which in turn has led to the expansion of their networks of facilities and rising control of transport. These include road and air and employ their growing purchasing power when acquiring space on the open market in all freight transport modes.\n\nMega freight forwarder-controlled air lift is expanding. There is a potential to crowd out the smaller freight forwarders which can not compete in terms of financial resources and controlled traffic.\n\nOcean carriers' entry into all-cargo operations and services are another disrupter. These international transport players are shifting their assets into the air cargo arena. These moves provide a multimodal offering to their BCO customers.\n\nDigitalization is increasingly becoming the norm in the freight transport industry and specifically in the air cargo arena. Reliance on traditional communications systems and protocols is waning as BCOs demand full and complete information about their shipments. Open access encrypted digital platforms are spreading from the Indian subcontinent and Europe as their benefits to all cohorts of the worldwide air cargo logistics industry are understood. In addition to operational and business benefits, these systems also address environmental concerns – a increasingly important focus of BCOs.\n\nThat should be enough to set the tone for this blog.\n\nSo put your seatbacks and trays in the upright and locked position. Stow all carry-ons in the locker above you or underneath the seat in front of you. And make sure your seatbelt is tight and secured around your waist. Now join me for a look at the worldwide air cargo logistics industry as we go below the wing and onto the main deck.\n\nCharles H.W.

{"text": "Author:Grant Chapman wind resistance\n\nPressure Washing Summerville SC is a common cleaning method that blasts dirt from surfaces. It uses high-pressure water to remove dirt and debris and leaves the surface looking brand new. Pressure washing can use hot or cold water to get rid of stubborn dirt and is especially useful for cleaning delicate surfaces. Listed below are some advantages of pressure washing. Read on to learn more. If you're thinking about pressure washing, here are some things to know about the process and how to use it safely.\n\nWhile pressure cleaning helps clean exterior surfaces, it can damage some materials and cause water damage. To avoid injury, always start your project at a distance that will minimize the chance of causing damage to your property. Start by scrubbing a small, inconspicuous area to test the pressure washer. Once you've determined what distance is appropriate for your project, move closer to the surface and repeat the process. Remember to read all instructions before using the pressure washer.\n\nBefore you pressure wash your home:\n\nRemove any plants, doorways, and plastic sheeting.\n\nCover leaking windows and doors with duct tape to prevent water seeping into them. Once you've done this, you can begin pressure washing your home's exterior.\n\nMake sure you follow these steps carefully to avoid damage to your siding.\n\nAfter washing, let your siding dry and dry for a few days before painting it.\n\nThere are two main types of pressure washers on the market today. Electric and gas-powered. They both require electricity, and the power of the electric and gas units varies greatly. The electric ones usually plug into a standard outlet. The gas ones can produce twice as much pressure, but they are not suitable for cleaning enclosed spaces. Electric pressure washers also generate hot water, which is excellent for loosening oil and other debris. If you want to save money while pressure washing, choose an electric model.\n\nThe most important factor when pressure washing your home is the pressure level. When the pressure is too low, the water will not flow through the pressure washer. The pressure should be high enough to remove dirt and debris from the surface. Otherwise, the cleaning results will be inconsistent, and the surface will need to be re-painted. However, you must be careful not to use too much pressure. This can damage the surface. When cleaning your home, remember that high pressure may cause the surface to crack and warp.\n\nA pressure washer should come with several nozzles. A nozzle with a high psi rating will deliver a more concentrated stream of water, whereas a lower one will cover a wide area. Choosing a nozzle is essential to select one with a corresponding angle. It should be firmly attached to the wand to don't rocket through windows or shrubs. Remember to close windows and doors while pressure washing.\n\nPressure washers are powerful tools, but they can be dangerous when not used correctly. The water in the nozzle can be boiling and can easily break skin if not handled properly. Always wear protective clothing when operating a pressure washer. Also, make sure you don't use the power washer on a ladder. If you're not confident about using a pressure washer, hire a professional to do you. It will be less expensive in the long run.\n\nPressure washing should never linger on the spot, so if you're new to pressure washing, you may want to practice on a smaller area before starting the work in a larger size. Make sure you hold the wand horizontally and at a slight angle. Start at the top and work your way down. You want to avoid streaks and lingering on one area of aboard. Finally, protect the screen or window by sealing it after the job is done.\n\nPressure washing consists of a high-pressure stream of water that removes loose paint, grime, and chewing gum from surfaces. Unlike power washing, pressure washing does not use a heating element. It also uses high-pressure sprays instead of hot water, which is safer for the environment. A pressure washer can reach pressures up to 30,000 psi, depending on the type of nozzle it uses. This process can be time-consuming, so you should hire a professional to do it.\n\nThe decision to hire a locksmith is an important one. However, choosing the wrong locksmith could end up costing you valuable time, money, and property. While you don't have to choose a professional locksmith, it's better to be educated about the services available and pick the locksmith that is right for you. To select the right professional locksmith, you need to understand how a typical locksmith operates. You also need to know what key types are appropriate for your needs.\n\nIf you plan to research locksmith options before contacting one of the local locksmiths, there are a few good locksmith choices to consider:\n\nHiring a Professional. Professional locksmiths are often used in a business setting. Professional locksmiths are highly trained access control technicians who connect a door lock to an electronic keypad, scanner, or key card reader to let people get into or out of a business or apartment. With an expert at the job, installing and repairing new locks/key replacements are often done within the hour. Of course, the fees that they charge are usually competitive with most local providers. If installation or repair needs to be done outside their regular operating hours, many also offer 24-hour emergency service.\n\nDeadbolts. While locksmiths commonly install and repair locks, they are also skilled in installing a wide range of deadbolts. From basic keyless entry systems to the more advanced door and window deadbolts, you can find a deadbolt that meets your security needs. In addition, a good locksmith will be able to determine which deadbolt is best for your home improvement needs.\n\nSecurity gates. Along with providing a more secured entrance to your home, locksmiths also use security gates to complete other home security tasks such as Intracoastal and Palisade entries. These systems use various technologies, including biometric scanners and proximity cards. They also work to prevent unauthorized access to your property.\n\nKeypad entry systems. These systems involve fingerprint recognition to gain access to your home or office and provide other security options, including Intracoastal and Palisade entry locks. They are often utilized to control multiple apartments or condo units by providing multiple user access to a single door lock. Additionally, a good locksmith services company will assist with other door lock services that may be required for your individual needs.\n\nGarage door locks. Many people own cars that contain sensitive and essential information stored in them. Locksmith services are commonly used to install high-end security systems for car garages. One advantage of smart locks is that they are commonly used to prevent unauthorized access to car doors. However, the installation process of these types of locks typically takes between one and two hours, depending on the complexity of the task.\n\nDoor lock installation. This type of emergency lock installation is typically required when there is damage to the door itself. While a locksmith can install damaged locks, a new lock installation may be required by a building owner or a building maintenance technician. This type of emergency lock installation will typically take approximately one hour from start to finish.\n\nInstalling deadbolt locks. Deadbolt locks are among the most challenging types of locks to install. They are usually used on exterior doors that are often locked from the inside. Therefore, it is essential to ensure that a locksmith service is available to perform this task. An experienced professional will install correctly secure doors and prevent homeowners from redoing the locks after they have been damaged.\n\nElectronic locks. Many modern cars already come with electronic locks, making replacing them much more straightforward than other locks. However, some older cars may still require a skilled professional locksmith to install them. There are several different electronic locks available on the market, and they can be challenging to master. Professionals who work with locks will better understand the technology and how to install it correctly.\n\nGarage door lock installation. Garage doors are among the most frequently replaced doors in a home. As a result, many homeowners choose to install their garage door locks to prevent the need for an additional lock installation later on. However, some locksmiths install door locks in addition to their other services.\n\nThese are just a few examples of how locksmiths can help homeowners who need added protection for their homes. Locksmith services can provide a variety of different services depending on the needs of the customer. Therefore, it is vital to research a company to ensure competent and professional staff available to provide quality lock installation services.", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "de7b6564-87f2-44d4-abdb-8fda450af029", "url": "https://www.soccorsostradalelozza.com/author/grant/"}
{"text": "Embryonic Stem Cells In Mary Shelley's Frankenstein\n\nRomanticizing his need for knowledge and infamy, the protagonist, Victor Frankenstein, of Mary Shelley 's 1818 novel, Frankenstein, asserts, \"No one can conceive the variety of feelings which bore me onwards, like a hurricane...Life and death appeared to me ideal bounds...I should... pour a torrent of light into our dark world\" (Shelley 94). In the novel, Victor essentially recreates life, a task normally attributed to God, without fear of the moral consequences. In modern science, many scientists have commenced research that explores the possibility of creating life through the development of embryonic stem cells, but support for this possibly life-changing inquisition is constricted by the unethical qualities of the procedure. Emphasizing the moral constraints behind the pursuit for knowledge, Victor Frankenstein demonstrates an ambitious god-like…show more content… Throughout history, mankind has had an unimpeded desire for undiscovered knowledge, but the implication of this knowledge has been restricted by ethicality, creating the question, \"What is the line between acquiring intelligence and acting upon it?\" This idea has become a reoccurring theme throughout literature and myth; like Adam and Eve, Pandora, and Lot's wife, Frankenstein examines the consequences of curiosity and the desire for forbidden knowledge. In the novel, the protagonist, Victor Frankenstein, demonstrates the mannerisms of a God-complex by manipulating his hunger for knowledge into an unfulfillable need to create a new superior breed of humans through\n\nRelated Documents\n\nWhen we speak about Frankenstein the first thing that crosses our minds is the tale of Victor Frankenstein and his creation that turned out to be his worst nightmare. The creation of this creature is the biggest question when it comes to this story and I believe an easy explanation for the creation of Frankenstein could be Cloning or stem cell research. Stem cell research is a very complicated process and can lead to difficulties but also has its pro's and although some people may claim that pursuing stem cell research is like playing the role of god like they said in Frankenstein stem cell research saves many lives. Some cons of stem cell research is that the plasticity or flexibility of these cells to differentiate into desired cells or organs…\n\nScience has come a long way since its surge from the Renaissance, a time of discovery and acceptance of new scientific practices. Biology, a science concerning life structures, has made very pronounced advancements. From subduing the black plague with sanitation to restarting hearts shortly after it seizes, it seems that there is no limit to what can be accomplished now in the 21st century. Creation of life has been a debated subject recently. The science and advancements we've made leave us with the question of its possibility.…\n\nIn the novel Frankenstein, Mary Shelley appears to be against cloning due to the treatment the creature faces from society, the creatures negative behavior, and how Mary Shelley describes the creature.\nA clone is a cell, cell product, or organism that is genetically identical to the unit or individual from which it was derived (Dictionary). The term cloning describes a number of different processes that can be used to produce genetically identical copies of a biological entity. The copied material, which has the same genetic makeup as the original, is referred to as a clone. There are three different types of artificial cloning: gene cloning, reproductive cloning and therapeutic cloning.… (Shelley 51).\" Victor Frankenstein, in his obsession with the pursuit of knowledge, devoted his early years to creating life. Upon succeeding, he realized his mistake of intruding on matters superior to his own; Frankenstein then focused on destroying his monstrous wretch to save humanity from its horrors. In his warning to Captain Walton, Frankenstein expressed the dangers that the acquirement of knowledge can bring, and with all of the new technological and medical advancements of the twenty-firstHis tale could be seen as a warning against pushing too hard to learn scientific mysteries. The theme may not be that the pursuit of all knowledge and discovery is dangerous and wrong. But Victor Frankenstein pushed his search past what was morally acceptable or healthy. He explained, \"Who shall conceive the horrors of my secret toil, as I dabbled among the unhallowed damps of the grave, or tortured the living animal to animate the lifeless clay? I seemed to have lost all soul or sensation but for this one pursuit\"…\n\nShelley argues that it is important to gain knowledge without becoming overly ambitious. She also argues that it is important for one to maintain their humanity and social connections while seeking knowledge in order to prevent one from becoming a monster. On the other hand, Milton seems to believe that in order for humans to be able to make better decisions, it is necessary for them to have as much knowledge as possible. However, Shelley's argument considers the moral and ethical issues that scientists must face when striving to make new discoveries. If scientists were to follow Milton's logic, they would make many more discoveries, but the world would also start to view science as a monster similar to the one created by Victor Frankenstein.…\n\nFrankenstein believes his best method of benefiting mankind is to create a new life form. Victor says, \"I became myself capable of bestowing animation upon lifeless matter [...] A new species would bless me as its creator and source\" (Shelley, 53). Creating life extends beyond scientific studies and human capabilities. This is an action done by God only and should not be recreated by man.…\n\nEvery human being makes mistakes, it is just part of life. But, the best individuals that fall into mistakes are the ones that learn from them. In the book Frankenstein, two of the main characters made the mistake of trying to go ahead of what they are able or capable of doing. One of them learned from the others mistake; therefore, he did not face consequences like the other character did. Robert Walton and Victor Frankenstein of Mary Shelly's Frankenstein contributed to the overall text by establishing the validity for the thirst of knowledge and man's desire to surpass human limits and boundaries.…\n\nKnowledge can be very dangerous because it can lead to isolation from others, it can harm his loved ones and the public and it can cost your life.\nWhen Victor Frankenstein turns to his teenage years, he is interested in the natural world. Victor's heroes were Cornelius Agrippa,Education is a large concept discussed within Mary Shelley's novel Frankenstein; or the Modern Prometheus. However, education within the novel is not discussed in a contemporary sense, insead using it to convey the concepts of irregular education, scientific discovery, and the importance of learning about one self. Throughout Frankenstein education is discussed in a variety of sense mainly in the forms of differing self learning and the use of self-learning to propel yourself forward. Self-learning is prevalent within the majority of the novel from the prefaces explorative and naval readings of Robert Walton, the learning of the Frankenstein family and the varying degrees of impact education has on the children especially Victor Frankenstein,…\n\nDuring the mid to late 1700s, the Age of Reason was in full swing, which brought with it a torrent of new ideas, philosophies, and attitudes towards culture as a whole. The Age of Reason was one of the driving forces and influences in Mary Shelley's Frankenstein due to the fact that it was a very controversial book about the creation of life which was not readily accepted at the time. Frankenstein was a benchmark of eye opening possibilities and fear of the unknown which was reinforced by Shelley's stress of God's creation versus Man's creation. Therefore, Shelley emphasizes the role of God's creation and Victor's creation which evokes the sense that the relationship and bond between the two plays a vital role in the development of the person or in this case the monster.…", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "3f182ee6-79e8-4a46-ae45-bc9baadf039b", "url": "https://www.cram.com/essay/Ethicality-In-Frankenstein/PKKTVQP2M5ZQ"}

{"text": "Buying My First Silvia - What's S15 Ownership Like?\n\nHitmo\n\nGuest\n\nLooking to buy my first S15 Spec R soon, just wanted to know what common problems they have, and what I should look out for when buying one?\n\nAlso, what are they like for reliability, do many things go wrong which cost a bomb to fix? I understand modifications will be expensive, but I don't want to be replacing turbos and rebuilding engines! I've only really owned Honda's before, I'm hoping the Silvia will be similar\n\nModifying isn't too expensive really. The upside is that there's plenty of stuff out there to buy, This is also bad money-wise lol.\n\nAs for reliability, it's a tried and tested engine that was in production since 1989. With the S15, you have the last variant of it. I personally haven't had any dramas with mine at all (but i've only had it for 5 months)\n\nMy car is so clean you could eat off it.\n\nThe engines are pretty sweet and most of the mechanicals are straight from s14 and s14a models with little tweaks here and there. Rough ones are usually pretty easy to spot, look for rust, rough running, noises from the engine box and suspension and smoke from the exhaust and overall always buy on condition is what I say, normally if everything looks spot on then it should be, they aren't the most complicated cars in the world when you look at stuff around now\n\nGet a nice looked after example and you should be in for a great time. Look for S15's where the owner is meticulous and the car is clean and well presented. These should give you fewer headaches down the track.\n\nI've had my S15 for about 1 year now and couldn't be happier. They're a little sluggish until you up the boost (maybe not compared to your Honda ) but they are a relatively cheap car to mod. Exhaust, intercooler, air filter, fuel pump, boost controller (15psi) and tune should see you close to 200kw with a nice safe tune. They're a very light, nimble, reliable, fuel efficient car. Take one for a test drive and you'll see what all the fuss is about\n\nmake sure you get one rust free, or you'l be backtracking like me trying to get rid of it! hahaha. other than that you wont regret your decision! awesome cars! see my signature for how much i love & drive it! haha\n\nHitmo\n\nGuest\n\nI'm not so sure about this, I've raced a few S14a's and won! Although the S15 does have an extra 50hp right? I've heard the easiest and safest way to up the power is install a bleed valve? What exactly does that do, up the psi?

{"text": "On lines of NEET, Now Single Entrance Exam for Nursing Studies\n\nUnion government has passed a National Nursing & Midwifery Commission bill to introduce single entrance examination for nursing studies\n\nIn a significant stride towards standardizing the nursing education system in India, the Government has recently passed a historic bill proposing a single entrance examination for nursing studies. This groundbreaking decision is poised to bring about a paradigm shift in how aspiring nurses are admitted to educational institutions across the country.\n\nNational Nursing & Midwifery Commission bill\n\nUnion government has passed a National Nursing & Midwifery Commission bill to introduce a single entrance examination for nursing studies. The move to establish a single entrance examination for nursing studies is aimed at simplifying the admission process, which has traditionally been plagued by multiple entrance tests conducted by different institutions. The proposed system would create a uniform assessment criterion, ensuring that candidates are evaluated fairly and equitably, regardless of the nursing college they aspire to join. This is expected to alleviate the stress and confusion faced by students as they prepare for a multitude of entrance exams. As per the bill, nursing exam boards would be constituted in every state for rating and evaluation of the nursing boards.\n\nEnhancing Quality of Education\n\nOne of the key advantages of a single entrance examination is its potential to elevate the overall quality of nursing education in the country. With a standardized assessment, nursing colleges can focus on delivering high-quality education rather than conducting admissions tests. This can lead to a more streamlined curriculum, improved teaching methodologies, and better training for aspiring nurses, ultimately raising the standards of healthcare services.\n\nEqual Access to Opportunities\n\nThe new system could potentially democratize access to nursing education. A uniform entrance examination would level the playing field for students from various socioeconomic backgrounds, ensuring that admissions are based solely on merit rather than financial resources. This move aligns with the broader goal of promoting inclusivity and diversity in healthcare, as students from rural and economically disadvantaged areas would have an equal chance to pursue their nursing aspirations.\n\nThe Government of India's decision to introduce a single entrance examination for nursing studies marks a significant leap towards reforming nursing education in the country. This move has the potential to create a standardized, equitable, and efficient system that enhances the quality of nursing education, broadens access to opportunities, and strengthens the healthcare workforce as a whole. While challenges lie ahead, the collective efforts of all stakeholders can pave the way for a brighter future for nursing education in India", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "0795731a-9fe1-438b-9a53-0616caa759fa", "url": "https://myexam.allen.in/single-entrance-exam-for-nursing-studies/"}

{"text": "Recognized by Fortune and Fast Company as a top innovator shaping the future of health and known for his pivotal role in helping individuals change their relationship with alcohol.\n\nJune 1, 2024\n\n·\n\n24 min read\n\nReframe Content Team\n\nJune 1, 2024\n\n·\n\n24 min read\n\nWhen Booze Takes Our Breath Away: Alcohol and Lung Damage\n\nAlcohol can cause lung damage directly by affecting the lungs' ability to perform gas exchange, leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). It can also have an indirect effect by causing infections, such as pneumonia and tuberculosis.\n\nPrioritize your respiratory health by quitting or cutting back on alcohol. Reframe can support you with science-backed programs designed to educate, motivate, and help you change your relationship with alcohol.\n\nWe've all heard of smoker's lung — that characteristic hacking, wheezing cough that's enough to scare many of us from ever trying a cigarette. But a drinker's cough? Is that a thing? If you wake up with a nagging cough that doesn't seem to ease up and gets more persistent over time, that glass (or bottle) of Chardonnay you've been downing on a regular basis probably won't be your first suspect. And yet, \"alcoholic cough,\" shortness of breath after drinking alcohol, and even signs of lung failure can all be signs of alcoholic lung disease. Let's explore this lesser-known respiratory problem in more detail.\n\nCan Alcohol Cause Breathing Problems?\n\nIt's no secret that alcohol harms many systems of the body. It wreaks havoc on the liver, crosses the blood-brain barrier, suppresses neural activity, and even disrupts our sleep. But what about breathing?\n\nAs it turns out, alcohol has both direct and indirect effects on our lungs. Let's explore the direct ones first.\n\nThe Lungs: A Brief Tour\n\nOur lungs are about as advanced as any piece of fancy technology. Here's how they work.\n\nAccording to the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, the lungs are a \"pair of spongy, pinkish-gray organs in [our] chest.\" Acting as the \"centerpiece of [our] respiratory system,\" they filter incoming air, delivering oxygen to the blood and removing carbon dioxide with each exhale. Inside the lungs, tubes known as bronchi that carry the air in branch off into smaller bronchioles, which are topped off by tiny air sacs called alveoli. It's in these microscopic alveoli that the magic of gas exchange happens.\n\nThe alveoli are tiny, balloon-like structures surrounded by a network of capillaries. These capillaries are so small that blood cells have to pass through them in a single file. When air reaches the alveoli, oxygen from the air passes through their thin walls and into the blood in the capillaries. At the same time, carbon dioxide, a waste product of metabolism, moves from the blood into the alveoli. This gas exchange process is crucial to life: as all of us who tried to hold our breath underwater know, it's a matter of minutes before we desperately need air.\n\nIn addition to the lungs, the respiratory system includes the trachea (or windpipe), chest wall and diaphragm muscles, blood vessels, and more. Our brain is the central hub in charge of regulating breathing rates by keeping tabs on oxygen and carbon dioxide levels in our body.\n\nAlcohol and the Lungs\n\nAlcohol wreaks havoc on the body, and the lungs are no exception. Emory University pulmonologist David Guidot has made it his life's work to study the effects of AUD on the lungs. As he explains in an Emory Medicine press release, \"The lungs are especially vulnerable because chronic drinking depletes them of glutathione, and the alveoli and small airways are very dependent on it. Normally, they have 1,000 times more glutathione than other parts of the body. Chronic alcoholics have extremely low levels of glutathione in the lungs.\" While the alcohol itself isn't the direct cause of the changes, the oxidative stress that it causes leads to glutathione depletion.\n\nWhy is glutathione important? It's an antioxidant that plays a vital role in keeping the lungs healthy and free from harmful substances. It also helps create and maintain T-cells, which are vital for immune function.\n\nThe Long-Term Respiratory Effects of Drinking\n\nChronic alcohol abuse and the glutathione depletion that happens as a result can damage the cells lining the respiratory tract, leading to a condition known as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). This severe form of lung failure can be life-threatening and happens when chronic inflammation leads fluids and inflammatory cells to accumulate in the alveolar spaces. The result? Our airways get clogged, making gas exchange less efficient.\n\nOver time, the lack of oxygen can take a toll on our health. If not addressed in time, it can lead to organ failure and other life-threatening complications. Other factors might make the situation worse: for example, infections, injuries, or breathing in stomach contents (something that can happen in severe intoxication) can all play a role.\n\nThe Link Between AUD and ARDS\n\nThe connection between ARDS and alcohol was first discovered in 1996 by a University of Colorado team led by Marc Moss. With the help of some lab rats who \"drank for science\" and demonstrated the link between alcohol and glutathione levels, Moss and his colleagues were able to see just how drastic the effect of booze on our lungs is.\n\nToday, scientists like Emory's Guidot and his colleagues continue to uncover new details of what's often referred to as \"alcoholic lung disease.\" One of his studies tracked alcoholic patients in hospitals around Atlanta, Denver, and Seattle who were admitted for various reasons, including septic shock and blood pressure problems. Guidot and his team found that the correlation between AUD and ARDS was even higher than previously thought. As Guidot explains, \"We followed the alcoholic patients to see how many developed ARDS, and it turned out that the relative risk of ARDS for those with alcohol abuse was closer to 4 to 1 than the 2 to 1 risk that was identified in the original 1996 study … The results were dramatic.\"\n\nAnother recent study is relevant to an even wider audience and is certainly food for thought when it comes to evaluating our drinking habits. Guidot and his team looked at the effect of alcohol on glutathione levels in \"relatively functional alcoholics\" — young folks who were treated for AUD in an inpatient facility, but were otherwise medically stable, healthy, and well-nourished. They found that glutathione levels in the lungs of the subjects were 80% to 90% lower compared with their non-drinking counterparts at the 2-3 day mark after their last drink and remained low for at least a week.\n\nAn Indirect Attack: Alcohol and Respiratory Infections\n\nIn addition to messing with their ability to deliver oxygen to the cells of our body, alcohol interferes with another important function of the lungs — their role in the immune system. The respiratory tract is lined with cilia, tiny hair-like structures that help keep the airways clean by sweeping our pathogens and harmful particles along with mucus.\n\nAlcohol can impair the function of these tiny sweepers, making us more susceptible to diseases — especially those that target the lungs in particular, such as pneumonia or tuberculosis. The result? An indirect (albeit equally devastating) attack on the lungs.\n\nAlcoholic Pneumonia\n\nBacterial pneumonia, also known as \"alcoholic pneumonia\" (when related to AUD), is one of the most common and serious complications. According to the NIH, pneumonia is an inflammation of the lung caused by infection by bacteria. That said, it can also be caused by fungi, viruses, and parasites. The name itself comes from the Greek \"pneumon\" (meaning lung), underscoring pneumonia's prominence as the classic \"lung disease.\"\n\nPneumonia can be serious (especially for sensitive populations), and with alcohol in the picture, things get even more gnarly. The first link between alcohol abuse and pneumonia dates back over two centuries when Surgeon General Benjamin Rush described the link between the two. Today, the CDC is still on board with Rush, describing pneumonia as being four times more likely to be deadly to people who abuse alcohol.\n\nTuberculosis and AUD\n\nIn addition to bacterial pneumonia, lung infections with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (the pathogen that causes TB) are also a particular threat for people with AUD. According to the WHO, TB is the second leading cause of death around the world, taking over a million lives every year. Spread through the air from one infected person to another, it often remains dormant and doesn't necessarily make everyone who contracts it sick. That said, those with a compromised immune system — including one weakened by alcohol — are more likely to develop serious symptoms.\n\nRSV and AUD\n\nWhile bacterial infections tend to be in the spotlight when it comes to alcohol-related lung complications, viral infections are also a concern. RSV is a common viral infection that affects the lower part of the respiratory tract and is very common in children, older people, and folks with AUD. Because alcohol affects the cilia that act as the \"first line\" defense force against invading pathogens, RSV has an easier way into the respiratory tract.\n\nSigns of Alcoholic Lung Disease\n\nNow that we know a bit about what we're dealing with, let's take a look at the signs to look out for if we suspect alcoholic lung disease might be a problem. Most of these signs are more relevant to ARDS, but some could be symptoms of respiratory infections that result from an immune system weakened by alcohol:\n\nShortness of breath. We might have trouble breathing, especially during exercise or activities that require exertion, like climbing the stairs. While shortness of breath can be a sign of many things (after all, who hasn't gotten a bit winded climbing up several flights when the elevator is broken), any changes from the norm could be a sign of a problem. If we've been drinking a lot, it's not a symptom we want to ignore, since it could be one of the early signs of alcoholic lung disease.\n\nChronic cough and wheezing. If we keep coughing for days or weeks, it could be another sign our drinking is interfering with our lung function. The \"alcoholic cough\" might be dry or could produce phlegm. A wheezing sound could be a sign of obstruction or narrowing of the air passages in the lungs.\n\nWeakness and fatigue. If we're feeling more tired than usual, compromised lung function might be to blame. Our body and brain might not be getting the oxygen needed to function properly.\n\nChanges in weight. If we see that scale going down without changing anything in our habits, it might initially come as a pleasant surprise. Not so fast! Unintended weight loss is cause for concern and could be a sign of chronic lung disease related to alcohol use.\n\nPain in the chest. Severe lung conditions or infections could get painful and definitely warrant a trip to the doctor.\n\nAs with all serious conditions, signs of alcoholic lung disease are not something to take lightly. If you suspect you're having symptoms, it's always best to get checked out as early as possible.\n\nCan \"Alcohol Lung\" Be Reversed?\n\nIt depends. If caught early enough, sometimes the damage can be reversed. In other cases, the damage might be quite extensive — however, treatment will still make a difference, so it's crucial to seek medical help.\n\nIf we're talking about acute respiratory conditions that were worsened by alcohol (such as pneumonia), recovery is usually possible as long as treatment is prompt. It includes a few key steps:\n\nStop drinking to let our immune system recover.\n\nTake medication (usually antibiotics) as prescribed. If necessary, we may be put on a ventilator to help with breathing issues.\n\nReceive appropriate aftercare and rehabilitation.\n\nIf our condition is chronic or we've had repeated bouts of ARDS, the damage might be hard to reverse completely. Still, quitting or cutting back on alcohol and receiving proper medical care can help us manage our symptoms or slow their progression.\n\nThe common denominator in all of these cases is changing our relationship with alcohol. Especially if it has landed us in the hospital with a serious infection, it's time to reassess things. (If that's you, stay positive — many people have been where you are and have found a way out, and you can, too! Reframe is here to help you every step of the way.)\n\nTips To Breathe Easy and Stay Safe\n\nAs for some general ways to keep respiratory issues at bay, here are some handy tips:\n\nLoad up on antioxidants. Many plant foods, such as fruits and vegetables, are great sources of antioxidants that can help keep your lungs healthy. Leeks, onions, and garlic are great sources of allium sulfur compounds. Eggplant, grapes, and berries contain anthocyanins. Apples, onions, and citrus fruits are loaded with flavonoids.\n\nMake exercise a habit. One of the best ways to increase lung capacity? Aerobic exercise. Whether you walk, jog, swim, or dance in your living room, pick an activity you enjoy and stick with it.\n\nDon't smoke. Those scary pictures and warnings on cigarette boxes are true. According to the CDC, \"More than 16 million Americans are living with a disease caused by smoking. For every person who dies because of smoking, at least 30 people live with a serious smoking-related illness.\" These illnesses include cancer, heart disease, stroke, lung diseases, diabetes, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), as well as emphysema and chronic bronchitis.\n\nSecondhand smoke is a known culprit, too, and contributes to around \"41,000 deaths among nonsmoking adults and 400 deaths in infants each year.\"\n\nSteer clear of outdoor pollutants. Keep tabs on air quality alerts on your watch, phone, or online. If your area is in the danger zone, limit outdoor time and opt for indoor exercise options. Also, try not to jog near high-traffic areas and avoid burning wood or trash in your backyard (or anywhere else, for that matter).\n\nAvoid indoor air pollutants. We sometimes forget about indoor air quality, but it matters! After all, most of us spend a good chunk of the day indoors. Stay safe by sticking to no-smoking policies indoors, avoid using harsh chemicals, and invest in an air purifier if you are sensitive to pollutants.\n\nWith these tips, you can keep respiratory issues at bay and breathe easier as your lung function improves. And if you need extra support to change your relationship with alcohol to make sure your lungs stay as healthy as possible for years to come, Reframe is here to help!\n\nSummary FAQs\n\n1. What is \"alcohol lung disease\"?\n\nAlcoholic lung disease refers to a range of conditions affecting the lungs that can result from chronic alcohol abuse. This includes direct damage to the lung tissues, depletion of protective antioxidants like glutathione, and a weakened immune response that increases vulnerability to respiratory infections.\n\n2. Why do alcoholics cough so much?\n\nChronic alcohol consumption can lead to what's sometimes called an \"alcoholic cough,\" which may be dry or produce phlegm. Alcohol can also cause shortness of breath and wheezing, which are symptoms of underlying lung problems like alcoholic lung disease or ARDS (Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome).\n\n3. How does alcohol affect the lungs?\n\nAlcohol can deplete glutathione, an antioxidant vital for lung health, in the alveoli and small airways. This depletion leads to oxidative stress and damage to lung tissues, which can impair the lungs' ability to facilitate gas exchange efficiently.\n\n4. What is ARDS and how is it related to alcohol consumption?\n\nARDS (Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome) is a severe form of lung failure that can occur from chronic alcohol abuse. It's characterized by chronic inflammation, fluid accumulation, and the clogging of airways in the lungs, leading to severe breathing difficulties and reduced oxygen supply to the body.\n\n5. Can alcohol worsen respiratory infections?\n\nYes, alcohol impairs the immune system's ability to fight off infections, particularly in the lungs. It affects the function of cilia, the tiny hair-like structures that help clear pathogens from the respiratory tract, making one more susceptible to bacterial infections like pneumonia and viral infections like RSV.\n\n6. Can alcohol lung be reversed?\n\nThe reversibility of lung damage depends on the severity and duration of alcohol consumption. Early detection and cessation of alcohol can allow some recovery, especially in cases of acute respiratory conditions. However, chronic conditions and extensive damage may only be manageable rather than fully reversible.\n\n7. What steps can be taken to improve lung health if I've been drinking heavily?\n\nIf you've been drinking heavily, the first step is to stop or significantly reduce your alcohol intake to allow your lungs and immune system to recover. Medical treatments, such as antibiotics for infections or other therapies like bronchodilators, might be necessary. Pulmonary rehabilitation and regular aerobic exercise can also help improve lung function over time", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "3fbf5f28-72f2-4c74-90e1-41ffaee45cb8", "url": "https://www.joinreframeapp.com/blog-post/how-does-alcohol-affect-the-lungs"}
{"text": "The Regent's Secret Chapter 60\n\n*Note author changed back between Qi Yuan and Zhao Yuan a lot in this chapter\n\nIn the second year of Da Cheng Qi Yuan, which was also the second year after Zhao Heng's ascension to the throne, although a few remaining forces were still lurking in the world, it was already difficult to shake the overall situation.\n\nAfter spending a long time in Pan Palace classes, Zhao Heng had become Li Yi's most familiar student. Apart from rarely missing the \"Rites\" classes, he even pestered Li Yi to teach him how to paint.\n\nLi Yi had a soft heart and always thought that Bai Xian might die young, so he let him bring his paintings every time and taught him whenever he was free.\n\nAt first, Zhao Heng just wanted to get closer to Li Yi and, by doing so, manage to get him to reveal many secrets of the previous dynasty. However, as he continued to paint, he unexpectedly fell in love with painting and began to take his studies more seriously.\n\nWhen Wei Che accompanied the emperor to paint landscapes in the mountains, he became bored at times. Zhao Heng criticized him for not being able to carve wooden stakes properly and said, \"How come I didn't realize before that you're a monkey butt?\"\n\n\"Your Majesty…\" Wei Che didn't expect the emperor to expose him like that, without any face.\n\nZhao Heng could paint for several hours at a time, but he couldn't meditate or practice cultivation. He had to keep watch all the time and had already eliminated all the dangers in the forest several times. He couldn't do anything and found it difficult.\n\nHe couldn't express his dissatisfaction with Zhao Heng, so Wei Che muttered, \"It's all because Li Yi got Your Majesty hooked on painting.\"\n\nUpon hearing this, Zhao Heng laughed and almost drew a crooked line. \"You know what, I really like Li Yi.\"\n\nWei Che remembered his initial impression of Li Yi when he was in prison. \"I always thought he was a clever person, and the rare thing is that clever people have integrity.\"\n\nZhao Heng's train of thought was interrupted, so he stopped painting and asked while washing his brush, \"Zitong, how do you think it would be if Li Yi became emperor?\"\n\nWei Che was stunned.\n\nThe emperor said, \"It's alright, speak freely.\"\n\nWei Che pondered for a moment and said, \"Putting aside everything else, Li Yi is too soft-hearted. Because of this, even if he became emperor, who would be willing to serve as his ceremonial guards? Even if they were all bristling with spines, it still wouldn't be enough to block arrows.\"\n\nZhao Heng laughed heartily. \"As expected, only you could come up with such a phrase. Royal Uncle also said that Li Yi is not suitable to be a monarch, but I like his soft-heartedness.\"\n\nZhao Heng looked outside the mountains and sighed softly. \"From childhood to adulthood, in the mansion and in the palace… I have never seen anyone who was soft-hearted.\"\n\nWei Che followed the emperor's words and couldn't help but think of the late emperor, the old Consort, the current empress dowager, the regent prince, and not to mention the people serving below them, including himself, there really wasn't a soft-hearted person among them.\n\nHe heard Zhao Heng sigh, \"It's not easy to be soft-hearted and still be alive until now.\"\n\nWei Che replied, \"Li Yi is lucky, for example, he met Your Majesty.\"\n\nZhao Heng didn't take it seriously, \"There is rarely such a thing as good luck for no reason in this world, let alone repeated good luck. I always felt that he was different from others, but I can't say what it is for a while. Anyways, I'm willing to accept him as my teacher, which is rare.\"\n\n\"Let's go back to the palace now. The autumn hunting will begin tomorrow. I rode to attend Li Yi's rite before, and now I'm looking forward to seeing his grand ceremony during the hunt.\"\n\nOn the day of the autumn hunt, the waning moon was still hanging in the sky, and everyone had gathered in the Imperial Forest Park. The cold dew rose from the ground, and the chilly dawn woke people up, with the sound of barking dogs and horses' breath around.\n\nLi Yi wore a Baohe crown and served as the master of the rite.\n\nThe darkness of heaven and earth converged in the distance, and white light penetrated the cracks, piercing through the chaos.\n\nEveryone seemed to return to the scene when they first saw him in Pan Palace. His beauty and magnificence made many people stunned again.\n\nLi Yi followed the ritual and took out his bow, arrows, and arrowheads from the west side of the ceremonial platform, then walked gracefully to the center to show his respect to the guests.\n\nThe current Minister of War, who served as the guest, was there. When Li Yi walked towards him with a bow, the sound of galloping horses came from afar.\n\nEveryone was surprised. Who would dare to be so reckless at such a grand ceremony?\n\nLooking in the direction of the sound, they saw a blue and white dragon beast galloping towards them in the dawn light.\n\nLi Yi and Zhao Heng almost simultaneously recognized the person who came.\n\nSince the regent prince had arrived in person, the position of the guest naturally had to be given to Zhao Yuan. Li Yi once again took his bow and walked gracefully to Zhao Yuan.\n\nThe man in front of him was dressed in armor, wearing a phoenix-winged helmet, and covered in gold armor with densely packed dragon scales, which made Li Yi dazzled.\n\nThe memory he least wanted to recall suddenly surfaced.\n\nIt was the autumn of the second year of Chengqian when Li Yi participated in the autumn hunt for the last time. Guo Jijiu was serving as the master of the rite, and Li Yi himself was wearing gold armor and a phoenix-winged helmet, dragged there by Guo Shen.\n\nIn previous years, Li Yi served as the guest, which was a glory for Pan Palace. Although he had become the Hidden Prince now, he still had a royal title, so Guo Shen had to insist on this matter, which was also in accordance with etiquette. No one could find any fault.\n\nHowever, it was inevitable that people were dissatisfied, so after the grand ceremony, when the autumn hunt officially began, Zhao Yuan led Li Yi and quickly disappeared from the sight of the crowd, heading deep into the Imperial Forest Park.\n\nIn the autumn Imperial Forest Park, there were only a few scattered clouds in the sky.\n\nTwo horses, one chestnut and one white as jade, carried the young men across a vast field. As the temperature rose, Qi Yuan turned around and pointed towards the foot of Wuliang Mountain, indicating that they would take a rest there at noon.\n\nLi Yi was about to urge his horse forward, but suddenly he lost his footing and sprained his ankle.\n\nQi Yuan had already ridden some distance ahead and only noticed something was wrong when he turned back. He quickly reined in his horse and asked with concern, \"What happened?\"\n\nLi Yi pointed to the saddle and showed him the broken strap on his stirrup.\n\nQi Yuan dismounted and examined the damage. After seeing the clean break, he told Li Yi, \"Someone is trying to harm you.\"\n\nAs he helped Li Yi up onto his own horse, Bai Yucong, Qi Yuan wondered if it was the work of Emperor Chengqian or Zheng San. At such a crucial moment, anyone could lend a \"helping\" hand.\n\nBai Yucong galloped quickly through the fields, but Li Yi's sitting position was unstable and he almost fell off. Qi Yuan quickly held him and said sternly, \"Hold onto me tightly.\"\n\nLi Yi clung to Qi Yuan nervously, unaware that the other man's eyes were growing darker and darker.\n\nThe hills in the imperial hunting grounds stretched on endlessly, covered in lush grass. Soon, the two riders found a dry cave at the foot of the mountain.\n\nQi Yuan removed his outer garment and prepared a spot before laying Li Yi down on his side.\n\nHe knelt down on one knee and checked Li Yi's ankle under the light. After feeling around for a while, he carefully took out some powder from his bag and mixed it with water before applying it to the wound.\n\n\"On the first day of the autumn hunt, I got injured. You can just send me back tomorrow,\" Li Yi said casually, having encountered such situations many times before.\n\nZhao Yuan made a muted sound of agreement, unlike his usual teasing response.\n\n\"Qi Yuan?\" Li Yi felt something was off and asked gently.\n\nZhao Yuan looked up, and on his face was a look that Li Yi had not seen in a long time, the same gaze he had when he first met Zhao Yuan.\n\nIn an instant, Li Yi felt like he was standing on the edge of a cliff, with a bottomless abyss below him and fierce winds pushing him from all sides.\n\nInstinctively, he leaned back a little, just a tiny bit away from the person in front of him.\n\nBut Zhao Yuan's entire expression changed when he saw this, and he leaned down to grab Li Yi, exerting too much force, causing Li Yi to fall into his arms.\n\n\"Qi Yuan?!\" Li Yi sensed that something was wrong and tried to sit up and ask.\n\nBefore he could struggle, Zhao Yuan forcefully pressed him down and, holding the back of Li Yi's neck, pried open his lips.\n\nLi Yi's mind went blank.\n\nIt was a kiss that was full of lust and desire, as if it wanted to open up all of Li Yi's shyness, ravage him, and make him surrender.\n\nIt was a kiss that declared ownership, promising to explore every soft spot on Li Yi's body, conquer him, and make him completely subservient.\n\nZhao Yuan didn't leave Li Yi any chance to resist. He burst through the city gates and took the city like a forceful conqueror.\n\nLi Yi felt like he was drowning, struggling to catch a breath, but soon another suffocating and lingering kiss came towards him.\n\nIn the midst of it all, he was held captive in Qi Yuan's arms, unable to escape even a tiny bit.\n\nWhen the countless kisses finally ended, Li Yi had no idea where he was. He was panting, trying to bring his soul back to his body.\n\nAfter Li Yi had recovered, Qi Yuan touched his cheek and even wanted to kiss him again.\n\nWhen he looked at Li Yi again, there was only a gentle smile on his face.\n\nQi Yuan's voice was soft. \"Huan An, do you trust me?\"\n\nLi Yi's alarm bells went off, and he looked at Qi Yuan with closed lips, their eyes meeting.\n\nAfter a moment, Li Yi knew that Qi Yuan wasn't willing to explain, so he reluctantly nodded.\n\n\"Yes, I trust you.\"\n\nQi Yuan asked again, \"If in the future, you couldn't draw anymore, would you mind?\"\n\nLi Yi's answer was quick, but his tone was resolute. \"Qi Yuan, drawing is my destiny. Even if I lose my hands, I will draw with my mouth.\"\n\nQi Yuan didn't say anything else. He went out of the cave to find water and food, leaving Li Yi waiting for him.\n\nAt dusk, Zhao Yuan had already cleaned the rabbit and returned to the cave with wild fruit and water. Li Yi watched as Qi Yuan started a fire with dry branches, which crackled loudly, and everything was quiet and peaceful.\n\nAt night, Li Yi laid in Zhao Yuan's arms, with Zhao's back against the cave wall, and his chin lightly resting on Li Yi's hair, his hand repeatedly stroking Li Yi's forehead and hair.\n\nZhao Yuan's movements were focused and gentle, but Li Yi could sense his unusual silence.\n\nHe tried in vain to break the silence and speak the words he had been hiding in his heart. \"Qi Yuan, if you can return to Dian Nan, you should go back as soon as possible, don't worry about anything else.\"\n\nZhao Yuan's hand paused, and his voice was slightly hoarse when he spoke. \"Why do you say that?\"\n\n\"According to the decree given to you by the emperor, there has never been such a harmonious relationship between Dian Nan and the palace. If Dian Nan Wang requests it, perhaps they will release you earlier, who knows.\"\n\nZhao Yuan smiled silently, but his sadness was hidden from Li Yi's sight.\n\n\"Do you want me to go back?\" Zhao Yuan asked.\n\n\"If you don't go back, how will you lead the Dian Nan army? I remember you promised that if the emperor ever bullied me, you would stand up for me. Without an army, what will you use to protect me?\" Li Yi joked, but his solemn expression turned serious. \"Qi Yuan, we are stuck here, with no way out.\"\n\nZhao Yuan's heart ached at his words. After his blood awakened, he thought he would never feel this way again.\n\nHe made a noncommittal sound, and Li Yi wanted to say more, but soon felt his eyelids heavy and fell asleep.\n\nIn the middle of the night, Li Yi was awakened by the fire, his mouth dry and his whole body feeling like it was on fire.\n\nThe pain all over his body was so intense that he couldn't tell if it was because his body was on fire or his organs had shifted. He soon became so pained that he couldn't speak.\n\nHe looked helplessly at Zhao Yuan, who was close by, with cold eyes fixed on him.\n\nHe saw Zhao Yuan pull out his dagger, bend down towards him with the blade flashing with a cold light. In one or two swift strokes, Li Yi felt a chilling sensation in his wrist and soon his blood flowed out, draining the last of his strength.\n\nZhao Yuan waited patiently as the dark poison flowed out of his body, estimating the speed of the blood flow. After half an hour, Li Yi had fallen into a semi-conscious state. Zhao Yuan quickly stripped off his clothes and sat naked in front of him, pointing the blade at his chest. He pierced the entire phoenix bird emblem with the tip of the knife, and drops of his own blood flowed into Li Yi's mouth.\n\nThe cool liquid was like nectar from heaven in hell. Li Yi swallowed it unconsciously as it flowed down his throat. The phoenix bird on Zhao Yuan's chest gradually lost its vibrant red color and turned into a dull purple.\n\nZhao Yuan had relied solely on willpower to hold on until this moment for his heart's blood to drain. He collapsed beside Li Yi, having completed everything according to the ancestors' notes, even remembering the smallest details. He was confident that he had not made any mistakes after reading it once.\n\nHe began to wait for a miracle, for the poison to subside in Li Yi's body. After a while, Li Yi's breathing gradually stabilized and he stopped gasping for air.\n\nAfter some time, Zhao Yuan heard Li Yi softly moaning beside him. He struggled to get up, knowing that the time had come. He tidied himself up and slowly walked towards the cave entrance. At this moment, there was not even a trace of light in the sky, and the coldness was at its peak.\n\nZhao Yuan looked back one last time at Li Yi lying in the pool of dark blood. Anyone who saw this scene, even Emperor Chengqian, could testify to his mercilessness. The use of poison and wrist-cutting showed that he was afraid Li Yi would not die easily.\n\nHe wanted to keep this scene in his heart, along with all the precious moments he had spent with Huan An. Even if they never saw each other again, he would have no regrets", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "649b110b-10d7-456f-89ca-3a6f7f993bfe", "url": "https://lazygirltranslations.com/the-regents-secret-chapter-60/"}
{"text": "Jeff Kightly's Songbook is a Peek into a Troubadour's Soul\n\nEnglish Singer-Songwriter Jeff Kightly\n\nThe idea of a wandering musician living off the land and telling stories and conveying wisdom through song has been romanticized since the Middle Ages, hence the term \"troubadour,\" which Merriam Webster defines as: \"one of a class of lyric poets and poet-musicians often of knightly rank who flourished from the 11th to the end of the 13th century chiefly in the south of France and the north of Italy and whose major theme was courtly love compare trouvère.\"\n\nWhile the Middle Ages and (hopefully) most of its customs and traditions have been washed away by the passing of time, troubadours did not go extinct. They are around, albeit rebranded under a new name: folk singers.\n\nEnglish singer-songwriter Jeff Kightly, in his new album with Bibliotheque's sub-label, Input Output Music (IOM), put on the troubadour hat and crafted a collection of songs exploring the human condition and telling stories full of love, loss, and self-discovery. His music lives in the same plane as those of Iron and Wine, Fleet Foxes, and Bon Iver Sufjan Stevens, with a dose of Clapton and a dash of Muddy Waters.\n\nThe album, aptly called Songbook: Tales of a Troubadour, is the perfect soundtrack for evocative ad campaigns and coming-of-age films.\n\nKightly started dabbling into music as a teenager when he discovered the cassette tape American Festival Folk Blues at his local library.\n\n\"It had John Lee Hooker, Memphis Slim, Lightnin' Hopkins on it,\" Kighlty said in an exclusive interview with APM Music. \"I remember going home and listening to it. Press play and thinking, 'I love the sound of all of these songs!'\"\n\nWatch the interview.\n\nHe then went into a 70s rock phase, listening to early Eric Clapton, and was introduced to the music of Scottish folk artist Iain David McGeachy, also known as John Martyn. This rekindled his love for folk music, which led him to the music of Nick Drake. While taking on the straightforward singer-songwriter path, he also explored other musical ideas that are less structured, like Jazz.\n\nSongbook: Tales of a Troubadour began with Kightly gathering song ideas he had sketched in the last ten years and putting them together like a musical scrapbook – sonic memories from his journey through this thing we call life.\n\n\"I was walking the dog in the fields opposite my house, and I kind of thinking them all through, put them together a little bit, strip out the ones that didn't kind of connect well with the others,\" Kightly said, looking back at how he developed the concept for the album. \"And after a few months, I had the kind of building blocks for all ten songs for the album, and they all kind of made sense.\"\n\nKightly is not a gearhead when it comes to recording. His setup is simple but effective: a laptop running a standard DAW, a few mics, and some usable plugins. However, he did emphasize that the most valuable tool in his studio is his Epiphone acoustic guitar, which he got in the US for ninety dollars when he was eighteen years old during a work exchange program in America.\n\n\"At eighteen, I did 'Camp America,' and it turned up; I hadn't realized that I was supposed to be the music person, that I was supposed to bring a guitar and strum around campfires each night so all the kids could sing,\" Kightly said. \"I didn't have a guitar, so camp leaders took me to a shop in their local town and bought this (Epiphone) for like ninety dollars.\"\n\nHe then sent the guitar back to England as a souvenir, thinking it wouldn't make it given the arduous journey it would take. To his surprise, the guitar made it across the pond. It's his most precious instrument because of its old, gnarly sound reminiscent of the guitar tones he heard in that American Festival Folk Blues cassette.\n\n\"This is the thing that I will save in a fire,\" Kightly added.\n\nAside from the Epiphone, Kightly loves his Dean Flying V electric guitar, which he says is a joy to play for heavier rock stuff.\n\nJeff Kightly has been making music for a long time, and Songbook: Tales of a Troubadour encapsulates all that is brilliant about his music. It is powerful, sentimental, and simply beautiful.\n\nAsked what advice he could impart to aspiring composers and musicians, the laid-back Englishman who embraces simplicity has this: \"You can start really simply. If your ideas are sound, You don't need a lot of stuff to make nice-sounding music.\"", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "d9c11927-eaef-4a20-af8e-463eb5630a20", "url": "https://www.apmindieartists.com/post/jeff-kightly-s-songbook-is-a-peek-into-a-troubadour-s-soul"}
{"text": "Not Your Typical Sports Network\n\n®\n\nFounder Friday #13- Five Things I Learned as a Football Student Manager\n\nThe celebration of USG's first-ever Football Student Manager Appreciation Week prompted me to spend some time reflecting on my own football student manager experience. There is, of course, no shortage of men and women whose careers in college or professional athletics were jump-started by their experience as a student manager.\n\nAs a wide-eyed 19-year-old walking into the Equipment Room for the first time in August of 2008, I could have never imagined the life lessons, friendships, and experiences I would soon gain. Here are just five of the lessons I learned:\n\n1. Do not take things personally.\n\nI quickly discovered no shortage of colorful language and intensity at my first few practices as a football manager. The entire practice was scripted down to the minute. Everyone was accountable for making the most of those precious minutes on the practice field. Inevitably, this would often result in a barrage of yelling if things were not going exactly as planned. Fortunately, my boss helped me understand that sometimes these coaches were yelling not because they were actually upset but because it was their personal method by which to increase the intensity of a specific drill or practice period.\n\n2. It takes a village.\n\nPerhaps the most eye-opening thing that anyone first experiences when starting in college or professional athletics is the number of various departments and people it takes to run a program. Equipment, Video departments, Sports Medicine, Recruiting, Game Ops, Development, Facilities, and the list goes on and on. This is, of course, in addition to the thousands of alumni and former staff associated with a program. Let's just say I never envied the 'higher ups' in charge of deciding who was allowed to travel on the charter, who received free tickets or bowl gifts, which coaches spouse would receive the best seats, etc.\n\n3. No one is above the program.\n\nBuilding off the above lesson, alongside seeing highly ranked recruits be suspended or kicked off the team or the team succeed even with a star player injured, always helped provide reminders that despite what my mom may think of me, I am not that important, & I along with everyone else is replaceable.\n\n4. A good work ethic will always be valued.\n\nI will never forget how nervous I was when I was first hired because I never had any similar experience and felt like I didn't have much to offer. I had spent my summers working in corn fields growing up and working the concession stand at the local swimming pool. Sure I had played football, but I didn't know the slightest thing about a Division I College Football operation. Thankfully I quickly realized that many of the things I was most frequently tasked with doing, such as setting up the practice field or laundry, only required a willingness to work hard.\n\n5. Even the most incredible 'dream come true' will not satisfy.\n\nMy student manager experience truly was a dream come true experience for me. The experience even exceeded my expectations in terms of the perks and relationships that developed. Yet I will never forget heading home across the Washington Ave pedestrian bridge one afternoon and realizing I was still empty inside. I wrote about this experience much more extensively in my February 2022 Journal. Still, God graciously allowed me to experience my 'dream come true' so that I could realize that even my greatest earthly dream falls short of life found walking in a relationship with Him.\n\nHonorable mentions:\n\n6. Even rich and famous people love (& feel entitled to) free stuff from the EQ room.\n\n7. 24/7 access to steam rooms and cold tubs and not having to work out with the general public are incredible perks.\n\n8. If the athlete did in fact, turn it in on their loop, it would be on their loop.", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "4eff6353-9698-4853-a9a6-ecceedbca88b", "url": "https://www.uncommonsg.org/post/founder-friday-13-five-things-i-learned-as-a-football-student-manager"}

Getting your estimates right is vital to your future business decisions.\n\nSince sales forecasting is a rather complex and time-consuming process, organizations seek ways to improve it, with many turning to machine learning.\n\nIn today's article, we're going to focus on machine learning sales forecasting. We will tell you what it is, its benefits, and the main sales forecasting techniques.\n\nWhat is machine learning?\n\nMachine learning (ML) is a subset of data science and artificial intelligence (AI). ML trains algorithms to enhance accuracy and \"learn\" the same way human scientists would throughout a data project. Machines are taught to recognize their mistakes in previously produced work fully autonomously, without any human verification.\n\nTo create a well-functioning machine learning model, data scientists 'feed' it with a sample of data from a larger, high-quality database. Next, they train the model and check its output until they've made sure that it generates accurate information. After the verification stage, they can use ML for data circumstances without clear outcomes.\n\nMachine learning is much more cost-effective and efficient than processes requiring ongoing human moderation. As a result, leaders throughout industries are adopting this model.\n\nMachine Learning and Sales Forecasting\n\nSales forecasting is a difficult process. As many as 80% of sales organizations admit to having a forecast accuracy not greater than 75%. Is there anything that businesses can do to improve it? They can – turn to machine learning. It uses neural networks, a machine learning algorithm that identifies various patterns in historical data.\n\nMachine learning generates accurate sales predictions based on time-series analysis, regression analysis, and decision trees. Since machine learning can analyze huge data sets, its predictions are much more accurate than those performed by humans.\n\nThe Benefits of Using Machine Learning in Sales Forecasting\n\nHere are some advantages you can anticipate if you introduce ML into your sales forecasting process.\n\nBetter Sales Forecasting Accuracy\n\nMachine learning models can process data and generate results with a speed impossible to achieve through manual, human work. This means whenever your sales team needs to plan for the months or years ahead, they can rely on their ML-powered analysis.\n\nIf you train an ML model on your real-life sales data (ideally, a large volume of information from various points in time), then you can rely on its prognoses' accuracy.\n\nProviding New Insights into Customer Behavior\n\nThe quest for improving the sales pipeline and closing more deals is never-ending. As machine learning can go over large amounts of data quickly, its role in boosting sales revenue is invaluable. How so? It reveals new patterns and insights into customer behavior.\n\nThanks to these, sales teams can spot new leads, build targeted sales campaigns, and predict which services or products will be in high demand.\n\nSaving Time and Resources\n\nMachine learning eliminates the need for manual data entry, manipulation, and analysis, significantly speeding up sales forecasting. These tasks are not only time-consuming but also prone to errors. Instead of dedicating their time to these mundane tasks, sales teams can focus on more strategic work that brings more value to the business.\n\nWhat's more, AI has excellent reporting capabilities. It creates clear and concise reports that can be nicely displayed on a dashboard, along with some metrics. This allows sales professionals to better understand and communicate the forecasts and make more accurate business decisions. They can modify their plans and focus on the most profitable opportunities or activities.\n\nSpotting New Insights Through Uncovering Patterns\n\nTraditional sales forecasting methods used by humans rely on comparing two variables in what is known as linear regression. IBM provides a great example — you could spot a relationship between your sales representatives' sales and their years of experience.\n\nWhile this is incredibly useful, machine learning models can get into far more advanced analyses. Often, this can reveal trends previously hidden in hindsight.\n\nIf you use an ML model, you could use your awareness of the high sales results–seniority factor and further find out that reps with the best results make twice as many outbound calls as others. Or, that they make most of their calls between 10 a.m. and 12 p.m., before their contact people go for lunch.\n\nThese are just a few hypothetical situations, but they prove just how sophisticated your forecasting techniques can get with the right ML model.\n\nLet's now look at six sales forecasting techniques that sales teams can use in their work.\n\nGut Feel Forecasting\n\nAs suggested by its name, gut-feel forecasting relies on your salespeople's intuition. You ask them how they feel about their current deals, which ones they think they will manage to close, and when. As you can imagine, the accuracy of this method is rather low.\n\nSmaller organizations often use this approach. Such businesses entirely rely on their sales pro's experience and gut feeling, instead of seeking answers based on data.\n\nAlmanac Method\n\nThe Almanac method uses historical data to predict future performance. While this approach is more effective than the previous one as it's based on facts and data, it's not ideal. It doesn't account for any market or macroeconomic changes that happen.\n\nFor example, using data from 2019 to predict what 2020 would look like would be a big mistake. 2020 was tumultuous because of the COVID-19 pandemic, which caused massive changes in customer behavior. As 2020 was nothing like 2019, basing sales predictions on historical data would be useless.\n\nThe Almanac method might work for companies that have access to a lot of historical data. The more data they have, the higher the chance of getting an accurate forecast.\n\nFunnel Forecasting\n\nFunnel forecasting is about taking a closer look at your sales funnel performance. What's your win rate? How long is your average sales cycle? What's the total volume of your sales pipeline? Getting answers to these questions will help you predict your future sales.\n\nLet's use an example to better understand how this method works. Let's say your sales cycle is three months, and your average win rate is 30%. If you have 12 opportunities in the pipeline worth $350,000 each, you can safely assume that your sales forecast for the quarter will be $1,260,000.\n\nThe accuracy of funnel forecasting will depend on the coverage of your pipeline, as well as its health and how up-to-date it is. You can use this method if your sales process is long. With simple, short sales cycles, it won't work as effectively.\n\nPortfolio Forecasting\n\nPortfolio forecasting is a mix of several sales forecasting strategies. You take into account both quantifiable insights like historical data and less 'tangible' aspects like years of experience, opinion, and potential market risks.\n\nThe goal for this sales forecasting method is to account for all possible factors – i.e., the entire 'portfolio.'\n\nFor instance, a sales leader could turn to a model for the upcoming quarter that:\n\nLooks at the number of existing sales-qualified leads (SQLs) and calculates the probability of converting marketing-qualified leads (MQLs) to SQLs.\n\nRefers to historic sales results (for the last quarter and/or the same quarter the previous year).\n\nTakes their sales reps' 'gut feelings' into account (for example, how likely they are to upsell to the key accounts they manage).\n\nComparing a specific situation to similar scenarios in the past.\n\nLooking at market trends, including the financial situation of their target customers.\n\nIf the methods that worked in the past aren't as promising for the current forecast, the sales leader can brainstorm ways that could help minimize a drop in revenue.\n\nMultivariate Regression Analysis\n\nAs mentioned earlier, so-called 'linear' regression methods rely on comparing two objects or data points directly related to one another.\n\nMeanwhile, multivariate regression sales forecasting is a statistics method where you look at multiple dependent variables and analyze them against one another. Their relationships can become linear after you establish how variables link to each other.\n\nTo understand how it works, let's refer to an example by MyGreatLearning. It can be hard to predict the weather in June by simply comparing it to historical data for that month. There are other factors, i.e., variables, like a rise or drop in overall pollution, rainfall, or drought — all of which might be harder to predict due to global warming.\n\nIf we put this into a sales analogy, the different variables that will affect your sales could include not only historical data but also:\n\nYou'll likely agree that this seems like an immensely powerful model. Unfortunately, there's a \"catch.\" For multivariate regression sales forecasting to be accurate, you need to ensure that your data is of high quality. The more informational gaps or chaos in your datasets, your results are less reliable.\n\nMachine Learning and AI\n\nMachine Learning sales forecasting is the absolute best method for large-scale analyses. It's the most versatile and powerful solution of all, as it can refine itself over time.\n\nYou can model your ML to reflect any (or all) of the traditional models and use your experience to tell which factors should be given the highest relevance. Your sales representatives can all contribute to your ML engines by powering them with their quantitative and qualitative information.\n\nOnce trained and verified in the initial testing stage, your ML can function as an independent assistant. Whenever it spots any new behavioral patterns or predicts potential risk factors, you and your team will be the first to know and, ultimately, adjust.\n\nMachine Learning Can Take Your Sales Forecasting to a New Level\n\nMachine Learning is bringing unprecedented speed and accuracy into sales forecasts. By incorporating it into your sales strategy planning, you and your team can react dynamically to any market changes — some of which your competitors might not even be aware of.\n\nLook at HubSpot's sales forecasting software if you'd like to learn more about how to increase your forecast accuracy and transform sales operations.\n\nRelated Articles\n\n51 AI Prompts for Sales Teams to Use in 2024 [+Expert Tips]\n\nHow to Get Started With AI in Accounting\n\nThe 10 Best AI Tools for Small Businesses and How to Use Them\n\n5 Ways Sales Teams Can Use AI to Sell Into New Industries, According to Eternal Works' CEO\n\nNov 20, 2023\n\n6 Easy AI Tricks for Busy Account Executives\n\nNov 20, 2023\n\nThe Age of Nearbound Intelligence\n\nNov 16, 2023\n\nWill AI Steal Your Sales Job?

{"text": "Strategy\n\nAs the description says, the Goblin Barrel can be launched anywhere in the Arena, allowing players to attack or finish off buildings they cannot reach. However, it is easily countered with damaging spells and area damage troops due to their low hitpoints.\n\nIt is a good idea to put a tank/mini-tank (such as an Ice Golem or Valkyrie) in the same lane as your Goblin Barrel, so the opponent's Crown Tower would lock on to the tank, potentially allowing all three Goblins to connect multiple times and deal massive damage to the Crown Tower.\n\nHowever, this combo can easily be countered by using a spell or splash damage-dealing card to destroy the Goblins before finishing the tank off.\n\nIt is not a good idea to leave a Goblin Barrel alone as it will do nearly twice as much damage to a Crown Tower as an equivalent level Rocket for half the Elixir cost.\n\nWhen the Goblin Barrel is placed at the center of a Crown Tower, the spawned Goblins split apart on all sides of the Tower, making them harder for area damage units to defeat.\n\nThis is why area damage units will sometimes hit all three Goblins before they are separated, such as a preemptively placed Valkyrie.\n\nIn this situation, the Crown Tower will first target the Goblin horizontally closest to the King's Tower. If the player lacks reliable counters, they should place their troop counter on the Goblin closer to the edge of the Arena. This will prevent more damage than placing the troop on the Goblin closer to the King Tower.\n\nThe Goblins from the Goblin Barrel have high damage per second, but low hitpoints. If it is being tanked by a high hitpoint troop that distracts the Crown Tower and any defending units, the Goblin Barrel can deal extremely high damage in a relatively short amount of time.\n\nAs Goblins have low hitpoints, they can be eliminated fairly quickly by Crown Towers. When using a Goblin Barrel to attack a King's Tower, the remaining Towers should be distracted with another unit, lest the Goblins be defeated quickly.\n\nAlthough the primary Goblin Barrel placement is directly on the center of a Crown Tower, there are other placements which vary in practicality.\n\nPlaying a Goblin Barrel 3 tiles above a Crown Tower looks very similar to a Barrel that is placed on the center of it (this is colloquially referred to as a \"tricky barrel\"). It may cause some Logs or Barbarian Barrels played too far forward to miss one or more of the Goblins, allowing them to sneakily deal damage. However, this does not work in 2v2 due to the increased width of the King Tower pulling the Goblins.\n\nA \"tricky barrel\" also can work against spells such as Arrows, and if you launch the Goblin Barrel in the top right/left corner, then they may miss the Arrows barely, allowing your Goblins to get a few stabs on the Tower, or force them to place another card such as a Skeleton Army or an Ice Golem to counter it. However, this will generally result in less damage done to the Tower, due to the Goblins having to walk towards it.\n\nAnother placement for the Goblin Barrel is 1 tile on the side of the Tower. If the player places a Barbarian Barrel on the center of their Tower, the small width of the spell will cause it to miss 1 Goblin, letting it stab the Tower twice. It is also much more punishing if the opponent guesses the wrong side, as all 3 Goblins will stay alive longer. However, this is ineffective against The Log as it will always hit all 3 Goblins.\n\nPlacing a Goblin Barrel directly in front of the Tower can be effective if the opponent plays their counters to the Goblin Barrel farther back. The Goblins will spawn more quickly and possibly get a round of stabs on the Tower before being defeated. This is most important against swarms like the Skeleton Army and Goblin Gang, as these swarms will not arrive in time before the Goblins attack the Tower.\n\nAgainst a Elixir Collector placed at the back corner of the opponent's side, playing the Goblin Barrel at the very corner of the Arena can be very effective if you know the opponent only has swarms to counter the Goblin Barrel, as they will not be able to play them on top of the Goblins, allowing them to deny at least 3 Elixir from generating. This can also work against spawner buildings, such as a Goblin Hut, however, make sure that the Goblins do not spawn when a wave of spawned troops appears.\n\nIf the enemy's King Tower is low on health, send the Goblin Barrel in front of the Tower as most of the time. Not only will they arrive earlier to the Tower, but also the opponent is more likely to place their units or spells at the back of the Tower.\n\nPlacing the Goblin Barrel in the outer corner of the Crown Tower is a good way to prevent the opponent from using a Tornado to activate their King Tower. These placement should be used when the player notices that the Tornado is their opponent's only way to counter to the Goblin Barrel.\n\nThe Goblin Barrel can force the opponent to use their spells, allowing the player to swarm their opponent with cards such as the Skeleton Army and Minion Horde. However, this strategy can backfire if the opponent has some splash damage troops, another splash spell, or a Mirror. If the player has a Mirror, they can send a higher Level Goblin Barrel at the Tower again, forcing them to react with less effective counters. A Mirrored Goblin Barrel is very deadly when the Goblins at least one level above the Crown Tower, as this will cause the said Crown Tower to take three shots to defeat them, which will allow the Goblins to deal much more damage if left ignored. However, the visual effects will reveal its location, making it easier to counter.\n\nWhen countering the Goblin Barrel, the player must not overreact and play a high cost card unless they are confident that they can turn said card into a counterpush, since the Goblin Barrel only costs 3 Elixir.\n\nSpells like Rocket and Lightning are impractical to use against a Goblin Barrel since it is both a negative Elixir trade and may not hit all of the Goblins. However, if the defending player is ahead in a match and their Tower is at low health, they can use these spells to clear out a Goblin Barrel in the final seconds of a match.\n\nSome spells such as Zap will not instantly defeat the Goblins when equally leveled, so a Crown Tower will take some damage. This is significant enough to fully destroy it over the course of a match if this is the only card played to counter the Barrel. The Royal Delivery, Barbarian Barrel, and The Log fully defeat the Goblin Barrel for a neutral or positive Elixir trade.\n\nThe Royal Delivery's lengthy deploy time means that the defender must be ready to react as soon as the Goblin Barrel is launched from the opposing King's Tower. It is helpful to know which Crown Tower they will want to attack and when they will have their Goblin Barrel in hand, so that the Delivery can be hovered directly over the Crown Tower and released immediately.\n\nThe Log is the best counter to the Goblin Barrel. A Level 11 The Log will defeat Goblins below Level 15, meaning that The Log is a reliable counter in tournament standards and on ladder.\n\nThe Barbarian Barrel has a slightly shorter width than The Log, meaning it may fail to hit all three Goblins against certain staggered placements. For example, if the Goblin Barrel is placed to the side of the Crown Tower, and the Barbarian Barrel is placed on the center tile behind the Tower, the outermost Goblins will avoid being rolled over and will get a stab in. Therefore, the user must be more vigilant as opposed to if they were using The Log. It also does less damage so Goblins 2 Levels above the Barbarian Barrel will survive.\n\nArrows are the most reliable counter to the Goblin Barrel because of its large area of effect, and Level 9 Arrows can defeat Goblins of any Level given that all three waves land.\n\nA Tornado placed 2 tiles to the left/right (depending on where the Goblin Barrel is flying towards) of the middle of the King's Tower, 1 second before the Goblin Barrel lands will not only prevent all damage from the Goblins, it will also activate the King's Tower.\n\nA Fireball will get the job done no matter what level the Goblins are, but it is a negative Elixir trade. Only use it if you must prevent all damage or when you are confident that your opponent will not have a higher priority target for Fireball, such as Magic Archer.\n\nWhile a Giant Snowball cannot instantly defeat the Goblins, when placed correctly, it can fully counter a lone center placed Goblin Barrel. The player should hover their Giant Snowball over the Crown Tower and deploy it when the shadow of the Goblin Barrel is 2 tiles above the Crown Tower.\n\nIf the player has no spells, then swarms such as the Skeleton Army and Goblin Gang will be able to negate the damage. When played behind the Crown Tower, both will cover all positions except the front tiles. Some swarms like Barbarians and Goblins may have to be placed slightly earlier in order to be able to fully stop the Goblin Barrel. The same principle also applies to the Witch and her spawned Skeletons.\n\nA Valkyrie placed one tile up from the bottom-outer corner of a Crown Tower can catch two Goblins in her swing and only let the Goblins get one stab on the Tower. The Valkyrie can be placed slightly ahead of time and hit all three Goblins due to her very quick first attack speed.\n\nSimilarly, a Dark Prince can completely stop a Goblin Barrel with his charge, since the hit from it is instant. If you can predict an incoming Goblin Barrel, place the Dark Prince behind the King Tower, facing towards the Crown Tower where the Goblin Barrel will land. The charge will fully defeat the Goblins and the Dark Prince will prepare for a counterpush.\n\nGood outcomes can be achieved with troops that can 1-shot Goblins; such as the Lumberjack. These counters are somewhat situational and depends on what else the player has to counter Goblin Barrels because the opponent can throw their Goblin Barrels anywhere they please.\n\nRanged units aren't affected by placement since as long as all three Goblins are in range, the result will still be the same. Archers, Musketeer, Wizard and other ranged units prevent all but two hits on the player's Crown Tower, and a Dart Goblin only lets three hits on the Tower. In some situations, the player may want to have the ranged troop tank a few hits from the Goblins in order to prevent more chip damage.\n\nAn Archer Queen can use her ability to hit the Goblins while she is invisible. Her boosted attack speed and range will defeat the Goblins quickly enough for no damage. The Golden Knight and Mighty Miner can use their abilities and counter the Goblin Barrel in a similar way.\n\nAlthough the Fire Spirit's area damage radius is not enough to completely stop a Tower-centered Goblin Barrel, if you drag any card like Skeletons behind the A Furnace placed directly behind the Crown Tower can stop the Goblin Barrel in a similar way, though it is a negative Elixir trade.\n\nPlacing a Bowler behind a Crown Tower will take out all three Goblins with the right timing. The Bowler should finish its deployment timer just as the Goblins spawn. Release him once the Goblin Barrel's shadow passes the enemy's Crown Tower. If the opponent tries to mix up their placement, the Bowler will still crush the Goblins anyway. He can then be used to build a counter-push. This can also be done with Hunter, but does not work if the opponent mixes up their placement.\n\nDue to a similar attack mechanic and counter-push potential, the Executioner can substitute the Bowler. He can destroy two Goblins in one throw, and the Goblin Barrel will get two hits on a Crown Tower.\n\nWhen using the Magic Archer against a Goblin Barrel, place him in such a way that he distracts one Goblin, while also hitting the top 2 Goblins with one attack. This will prevent the most damage from the Goblin Barrel.\n\nThere is a precise technique for the Mega Knight's spawn damage to hit all three Goblins, provided that the Goblin Barrel is placed on the center of the Crown Tower. The Mega Knight should be deployed right as the Goblin Barrel's shadow crosses the river, and all three Goblins will immediately be destroyed. The Mega Knight should be placed on the middle tile on any side of the Crown Tower.\n\nAn adept opponent may keep note of which side the defender drops their Mega Knight on, and stagger their Barrel one tile opposite to its placement and make the Mega Knight miss all three Goblins. This can be predicted in turn, but it is important to note that the Mega Knight costs 7 Elixir compared to the Goblin Barrel's 3. Unless the defender has enough Elixir to capitalize with the Mega Knight on the counterpush, they may want to consider a cheaper, less risky alternative to preventing damage.\n\nThe Electro Wizard and Ice Wizard are alsoFlying swarm troops such as Bats or Minions can be effective when placed directly above the Goblin Barrel's landing, as they will safely destroy the Goblins without being counterattacked.\n\nAn effective offensive strategy is to play a Princess at the bridge after sending a Goblin Barrel to the opponent's Crown Tower. The opponent will likely be distracted by the Goblin Barrel and allow the Princess to lock onto the Crown Tower, and since they cannot hit both with one spell, they will have to choose which one to go for. If combined with a tricky barrel, it may even result in the opponent missing both cards with their spell.\n\nAn activated King's Tower is an enormous problem for a Goblin Barrel user. The King's Tower can attack alongside any Crown Tower and their combined targeting will eliminate the Goblins faster, severely weakening a Goblin Barrel push. Try not to have troops in your deck that are exploitable for King Tower activations like Electro Spirit and Firecracker.\n\nFreeze is an effective combo with Goblin Barrel as the Tower will be frozen while the Goblins deal damage. However this push is risky as it can be countered by area damage cards, mostly for a positive Elixir trade. Rage and Clone can be utilized in a similar way, for a slightly lower Elixir cost.\n\nOn defense, a properly placed Goblin Barrel can surround a Sparky. Taking her out with the assistance of the Crown Tower as she will have to shoot 3 times to take out all 3 Goblins.\n\nOn 3/5/2016, the May 2016 Update, fixed the \"range bug\", which decreased the Goblins' range to 0.5 tiles (from 1 tile), but their effective range was unchanged. It also made a small change to the Goblin Barrel's card description. Also, before the update, the Goblin Barrel was able to spawn Level 13 Goblins while the Level cap for the Skeletons card was 12. The Witch was able to do the same with the Skeletons.\n\nOn 21/6/2016, a Balance Update, decreased the Goblins' spawn time to 1 second (from 1.2 seconds).\n\nOn 11/10/2017, a maintenance break, temporarily removed the Goblin Barrel from the Touchdownmode due to a bug where scoring a touchdown did not clear flying barrels from the Arena, which break into Goblins to score another touchdown while the opponent is unable to defend against it.\n\nOn 6/5/2019, a Balance Update, decreased the Goblins' spawn time to 1.1 seconds (from 1.2 seconds).\n\n2021\n\nOn 7/6/2021, the Summer 2021 Update, moved the Arena to unlock the Goblin Barrel from Goblin Stadium to Barbarian Bowl. It also added a card render to the Goblin Barrel's card info screen.\n\nOn 27/10/2021, the Champions Update, increased the Level cap of all cards to 14 (from 13).\n\n2022\n\nOn 26/10/2022, the 2022 Quarter 3 Update, increased the Goblins' first attack time interval to 0.4 seconds (from 0.2 seconds). It also moved the Arena to unlock the Goblin Barrel from Barbarian Bowl to P.E.K.K.A's Playhouse.\n\nGallery\n\nCard render\n\nGoblin Barrel Barrel's name translates to \"Kobold Barrel\". In the Spanish, Arabic, Thai, and Vietnamese language setting of the game, the Goblin Barrel's name translates to \"Duende Barrel\", \"Ghoul Barrel\", \"Goblin Tank\" and \"Leprechaun Box", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "a3a80742-701f-425a-8cee-d361b5880bfc", "url": "https://clashroyale.fandom.com/wiki/Goblin_Barrel"}
{"text": "The Importance of Roof Repair or Replacement for Home Improvement Needs\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe roof is a crucial component of any home, providing protection from the elements and contributing significantly to the structural integrity and aesthetic appeal of the property. Over time, roofs can suffer from wear and tear, leading to damage that requires either repair or replacement. Understanding the importance of timely roof repair or replacement is essential for maintaining the safety, efficiency, and value of a home.\n\nSigns That Your Roof Needs Repair or Replacement\n\nRecognizing the signs that your roof needs attention is the first step in addressing potential issues before they escalate.

{"text": "In The Displaced Person, Flannery O'Connor has applied use of several literary techniques in revealing specific traits of the characters that appear in the story. Being that she was brought up in a Southern farm, when the atmosphere was full of the aftermath of World War II, Connor associates this story with a similar environment. Specifically, she tends to be keen on the character traits of Mr. Shortley, amidst other aspects portrayed in the story. This study highlights three main literary techniques that the author has applied in revealing the immoral character traits of this character. The major techniques considered for this analysis include symbolism, simile and dialogue, among others (Tutoring Services 1).\n\nPurpose of the Work Selected\n\nConnor's work has evidently portrayed the humaneness in him as the author, since she is positively concerned about the evil traits she unveils in the story. Due to the fact that she has an uncompromising religious personality, her intention of revealing Mrs. Shortley's evil characters are for the purpose of showing how innocent persons suffer in the hands of jealous and competition oriented beings. The innocent displaced person, Mr. Guizac, is confronted by Mr. Shortley through Mrs. Mclntyre besides other media, to enhance his firing from the job. The main reason was based on Guizac's genuine hard work, which to Mr. Shortley and the wife was a threat. Connor has generally portrayed what happens in the real world, where some accidents are made for satisfaction of evil thirst, and the fact that good people are never appreciated.\n\nSymbolism\n\nThe presence of the peacock in the story is very symbolic (Fadaee 20), and reveals a specific trait in Mrs. Shortley. Analysis of other works of the author reveals her passion for the birds, with the peacock being her best. The relationship that Mrs. Shortley has with the peacock may appear ambiguous. This is very deliberate, and is evident when the bird follows her but she tends to assume (O'Connor 585). She does not appreciate the presence of the bird, and is not noticing her fascination with the bird. Secondly, at point when the author talks of the 'fiery wheels with fierce dark eyes in them' (O'Connor 587) the words describe the suspicious eyes of the peacock, which in this case symbolises the church's concern on the traits of Mrs. Shortley. The author has used this bird, as a measure of morality level in Mrs. Shortley, which has portrayed her to be wanting.\n\nSimile\n\nUse of this class of imagery has been applied by the author while describing the thoughts in Mrs. Shortley's mind while viewing the family of the displaced person, on their arrival. From the following words, 'Every time she had seen them in her imagination, the image she had got was of the three bears, walking single file, with wooden shoes on like Dutchmen and sailor hats…' (O'Connor 585), the use of simile reveals the negative attitude that Mrs. Shortley has towards the displaced persons. The second instance also occurs when she describes the girl's name (from the displaced family), as sounding like something that could name a bug (O'Connor 586). This also exposes her negativity towards this family, she passionately hates them as she compares them with things that are disregarded or looked down upon.\n\nDialog\n\nUse of this technique portrays Mrs. Shortley's words directly when she is communicating to other parties within the story. For instance, when the author quotes her words 'They're what is called Displaced Persons,' (O'Connor 587) her immoral trait is unveiled more, she is not welcoming and is jealous. Secondly, when talking to her husband, the author quotes her critique on the displaced person, questioning whether he could drive a tractor (O'Connor 588), when he could not speak English. In reality, the ability to speak English is not related to the ability to drive a tractor. Therefore, these words were meant to demoralise the displaced person, and they portrayed Mrs. Shortley as a backbiter.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe literary techniques discussed above are but a few among the numerous others that Connor used in this work. First, the author's concern while describing Mrs. Shorley's intentions and imaginations, portrayed her (the author) as concerned and focusing to reveal such realities within the community in which she grew. This study has also pointedly focussed on the use of the three techniques, discussed above, in revealing the immoral traits of Mrs. Shortley towards the family of the displaced persons. Symbolism applied to the peacock, measured her moral standards to be low, similarly exposed her jealousy while the dialogue showed her backbiting trait. Use of these techniques has enabled the author to expose real intentions behind the words of this immoral family character.\n\nDid you like this sample?\n\nFadaee, E. \"Symbols, metaphors and similes in literature: A case study of 'Animal Farm'.\" Journal of English and Literature Vol. 2(2) (2011): 19-27.", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "987e6191-f4d7-47f3-b76f-954b63dd72d4", "url": "https://essaywriter.org/examples/immoral-traits-of-the-shortleys"}
{"text": "A 40-Meter Inverted L Antenna. Post #216\n\nDuring the past few weeks, I've been experimenting with the versatile inverted L antenna for my small house lot. I find the antenna simple, inexpensive, and easily concealed.\n\nAn inverted L is a bent quarter-wave Marconi vertical fed against a system of surface, buried, or elevated radials. The vertical segment should be as high as possible, with the remaining length running horizontal to a nearby tie off point. Coaxial feed line can be used for monoband operation or 450-ohm ladder line can be employed if multiband use is planned.\n\nMATERIALS:\n\nTwo vertical structures to support the antenna--one for the vertical segment and the other to tie off the horizontal wire running from the top of the mast. I had a homemade 20-foot/6.09 meters pvc mast under the house and a convenient Norfolk Pine Tree at the edge of my property to support the horizontal portion of the antenna.\n\nSixty-six feet/20.12 meters of #14 AWG house wire for the radial system and the antenna element.\n\nThree, 6-foot/1.82 meters wooden stakes. One stake would support the vertical mast, while one stake would support an elevated radial running from the mast. The elevated radial would be approximately 5-feet/1.52 meters above ground. The remaining wooden stake would support the 450-ohm feed line midway between the mast and the garage wall, where a 4:1 balun would be placed. The ladder line was not allowed to touch the ground.\n\nIf you plan on monoband operation, you can use 50-ohm coaxial cable for your feed line.\n\nFour ceramic insulators, one to tie off the horizontal portion of the antenna to the tree, one to attach to the tip of the mast, one to tie off the bottom of the antenna element on the mast, and one to tie off the elevated radial wire.\n\nA launching system to put the upper portion of the antenna through a tree branch. I used a slingshot, 50-feet/15.24 meters of fishing line, and a sinker to place the antenna up in the tree.\n\nShort coaxial cable patch cords to connect the Drake MN-4 to the Swan 100 MX transceiver, the low pass filter, and the dummy load.\n\nASSEMBLY:\n\nUsing the general formula 234/f (MHz)=L (ft), I calculated the length of the quarterwave vertical for my chosen frequency of 7.088 MHz. This came out to 33.01 feet/10.065 meters. I rounded off the figure to 33-feet/10.06 meters. With my lowest frequency in the 40-meter amateur radio band, I could have multiband capability between 40- and 10-meters with the use of 450-ohm ladder line as my feed line.\n\nAlthough many antenna experts recommend a slightly longer length for the radial wire (about 5%), I decided to keep the radial wire the same length as the antenna element (33-feet/10.06 meters).\n\nOnce I cut the wire to the proper length, I attached the antenna wire to the monofilament fishing line and shot it over a pine tree bough approximately 35-feet/10.67 meters above ground. I left the antenna wire loosely hanging from the tree branch until I connected the wire to the top of the mast.\n\nI attached a ceramic insulator to the tip of the mast and then threaded the antenna wire from the tree branch through the top insulator and down the vertical 20-foot/6.09 meter mast. The antenna wire would be secured slightly above ground once I got the antenna adjust for proper tightness.\n\nI hoisted the pvc mast onto its support stake, tied off the fishing line holding the upper portion of the antenna to the pine branch, and tightened the antenna by bringing the vertical portion down to a point approximately 5-feet/1.52 meters off the ground. Nylon ties were used to secure the wire to the pvc mast. The antenna sloped slightly upward from the tip of the mast. At the 5-foot/1.52 meter mark on the mast, I attached and soldered the 450-ohm ladder line to the vertical element and the elevated radial. The radial was tied off at a wooden stake approximately 5-feet/1.52 meters above ground. The elevated radial ran through the garden and was not visible from the street.\n\nThe ladder line was run off at a right angle to the vertical mast to a 6-foot/1.82 meters wooden stake a short distance away. The ladder line was kept off the ground until it was attached to the W9INN 4:1 balun mounted on the garage door.\n\nA 25-foot/7.62 meters length of RG-8X coaxial cable was connected to the 4:1 balun. The cable was routed through a homebrewed patch panel in the shack window to the Drake MN-4 antenna transmatch. Short patch cords connected the transmatch to the Swan 100 MX, the dummy load, and the low pass filter.\n\nINITIAL RESULTS:\n\nWith the help of the Drake MN-4 transmatch, I was able to get a SWR of 1.1 to 1 on the 40, 20, 15, and 10 meter amateur radio bands. With an output of 50 watts, I was able to get reception reports between 569 to 599 on cw and 55 to 59 on ssb. My best band was 40-meters, followed by 15- and 20-meters, where the tuning was a bit more critical.\n\nPerformance should increase when I add more elevated radials. Fortunately, there is sufficient room to run a few more radials through the garden and in the area near the Norfolk Pine Tree. I ran the single elevated radial as an experiment. It works, but more radials would surely help the efficiency of the antenna.\n\nSince the mast is colored a dull grey, it can hardly be seen from the street in front of my house. The antenna wire is nearly invisible, too.\n\nFor an inexpensive antenna, the performance is adequate for my purposes. I get great local coverage and decent DX from my location on Hawaii Island.\n\nYou can join camera", "language": "eng", "warc_record_id": "f6646a1c-0bb2-48f7-bf0b-6da2c4c38048", "url": "https://www.simplehamradioantennas.com/2013/07/a-40-meter-inverted-l-antenna-post-215.html"}
